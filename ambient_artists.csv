Title,Text
"""Heroes"" (David Bowie album)","""Heroes"" is the 12th studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 14 October 1977 through RCA Records. Recorded in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti, it was the second release of his Berlin Trilogy, following Low, released in January the same year, and the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. Sessions took place in mid-1977 after Bowie completed work on Iggy Pop's second solo album Lust for Life. Much of the same personnel from Low returned for ""Heroes"", augmented by the King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.
The majority of the tracks were composed on the spot in the studio, the lyrics not being written until Bowie stood in front of the microphone. The music builds upon its predecessor's electronic and ambient approaches, albeit with more positive tones, atmospheres and passionate performances. The album also follows the same structure as its predecessor, side one featuring more conventional rock tracks and side two featuring mostly instrumental tracks.
The cover photo, like Iggy Pop's The Idiot, is a nod to the painting Roquairol by the German artist Erich Heckel. Upon release, ""Heroes"" was a commercial success, peaking at number 3 in the UK and number 35 in the US. It was the best-received work of the Berlin Trilogy on release; NME and Melody Maker each named it their respective album of the year. Bowie promoted the album extensively with television appearances and interviews. He supported Low and ""Heroes"" on the Isolar II world tour throughout 1978, live performances from which appear on multiple live albums.
""Heroes"" has received enduring praise, particularly recognised for Fripp's contributions and the album's place within Bowie's longterm artistic development. Though critical opinion has viewed Low as the more groundbreaking record, ""Heroes"" is regarded as one of Bowie's best, most influential works. The title track, initially unsuccessful as a single, has remained one of his best-known and most-acclaimed songs. An altered and obscured version of the cover artwork was later used for the cover of The Next Day (2013). ""Heroes"" has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the box set A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982).

Background
In the second half of 1976, David Bowie moved to Switzerland with his wife Angela to escape the drug culture of Los Angeles. He then moved to the Château d'Hérouville in Hérouville, France, with his friend, the singer Iggy Pop, where the two recorded his debut studio album The Idiot in the summer of 1976. After meeting with the musician Brian Eno the same year, Bowie, the producer Tony Visconti and Eno began work on Low, the first instalment of what would come to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. Recording for Low began in September 1976 and continued through November, finishing up at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, following Bowie and Pop's move there.
RCA Records stalled on releasing Low for three months, fearing poor commercial performance. Upon its eventual release in January 1977, it received little to no promotion from both RCA and Bowie himself, who felt it was his ""least commercial"" record up to that point and instead opted to tour as Pop's keyboardist. The tour, launched to support The Idiot, lasted from March to April 1977. After the tour's completion, Bowie and Pop returned to Hansa Tonstudio 2, where they recorded Pop's next solo album Lust for Life in two and a half weeks, from May to June 1977. By the time he finished Lust for Life, Bowie was ready to begin work on his next record. In mid-June, he travelled to Paris to undertake his first promotional appearances in over a year. He filmed a music video for his Low single ""Be My Wife"", then taped two interviews with French journalists a week later. Afterwards, Bowie contacted Eno to discuss their next collaboration. The two spent a few weeks devising concepts and ideas for the new album before they were joined by Visconti, who was busy with other commitments.

Production
Studio and personnel
For the album, Bowie, Visconti and Eno regrouped at Hansa Studio 2 in West Berlin. Although the album was the second instalment of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy, it was the only one recorded entirely in Berlin. The studio was a former concert hall converted into a recording studio that had been used by Gestapo officers during World War II as a ballroom. The studio was located about 500 yards from the Berlin Wall, leading Bowie to describe it as ""the hall by the wall"". Describing how the location of the studio affected the creative process, Visconti recalled: ""Every afternoon I'd sit down at [a] desk and see three Russian Red Guards looking at us with binoculars, with their Sten guns over their shoulders, and the barbed wire, and I knew that there were mines buried in that wall, and that atmosphere was so provocative and so stimulating and so frightening that the band played with so much energy"". The guitarist Carlos Alomar told the biographer David Buckley: ""These things [Germans, Nazis, the Wall, oppression] are hanging in the air, and when things get darker physically, you kind of think of darker themes too. Berlin was a rather dark, industrial place to work."" Despite the dark atmosphere, Visconti particularly had an exciting time creating the album, saying, ""It was one of my last great adventures in making albums.""

Most of the album was recorded with the same personnel as its predecessor Low, with Alomar, George Murray and Dennis Davis as the core band. Bowie played piano, having gotten significantly more experience playing the instrument during his time with Pop. An addition to the lineup was the guitarist Robert Fripp, formerly of the band King Crimson, who was recruited at Eno's suggestion. The guitarist recalled: ""I got a phone call [from Brian Eno] when I was living in New York in July 1977. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. David said, 'Would you be interested in playing some hairy rock 'n' roll guitar?' I said, 'Well, I haven't really played for three years – but, if you're prepared to take a risk, so will I.' Shortly afterward, a first-class ticket on Lufthansa arrived."" Upon his arrival to the studio, Fripp sat down and recorded lead guitar parts for tracks he had never heard before. He also received little guidance from Bowie, who had yet to write lyrics or melodies. Fripp completed all his guitar parts in three days. Fripp's playing received significant praise from Visconti and Eno, who were impressed with Fripp's ability to play for songs he had never heard before with such ""virtuosity"". According to the biographer Nicholas Pegg, Fripp was not Bowie's first choice. Michael Rother of the German band Neu! had originally been approached to contribute, but shortly before the sessions began, he was contacted by an unknown person and informed that Bowie had changed his mind, although later interviews with Bowie suggested otherwise.
While producing other Bowie records, Visconti found that new ideas were flowing at a consistent basis and because of this, sometimes they tended to be forgotten. In order to counteract this, he kept a two-track tape running at all times. Murray recalled: ""Tony had the insight to see what was happening in rehearsals so he just switched on the tape machines and let them run."" Visconti himself later recalled: ""It came in handy so many times...because we'd get lost. We'd start with an idea then go in the wrong direction, and after an hour we'd say 'How did this start again?'"" During the sessions for Low, Visconti became frustrated with the lack of studio staff present at the Château. At Hansa however, he was assisted by in-house engineer Eduard Meyer, whom Visconti recalled was critical in maintaining a positive atmosphere. Likewise, the mood during ""Heroes"" was brighter and more optimistic than the sessions for Low. Bowie in particular was in a healthier state of mind. He and Visconti would travel around Berlin frequently and one on such occasion, they met Antonia Maass, a local jazz singer who would go on to provide backing vocals on ""Heroes"".

Recording process
According to the biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook, the recording process for ""Heroes"" began at a very quick pace, following along from Low's process, with the basic backing tracks for side one being completed in just two days. Although he fed Davis's drums through his Eventide H910 Harmonizer on Low, Visconti used it sparingly on ""Heroes"", only during the mixing stage, and as such, the drum sound is atmospheric to the room; Davis also added congas and timpani to his set to take advantage of the large studio space. Visconti gave high praise to Davis, calling him ""one of the best drummers I've ever worked with,"" further calling Alomar and Murray ""amazing musicians...you'd just throw a few chord changes at them and they'd run with it."" In an interview with NME later in the year, Eno said the initial phase of recording was ""all done in a very casual kind of way."" Bowie gave ""very brief instruction"", then the band would play. Hesitant at first, Eno found the process surprisingly effective, with most tracks being done in one take. Eno stated, ""We did second takes, but they weren't nearly as good.""
Overall, Eno had a much greater role on ""Heroes"" than he had for Low, being credited as co-author on four of the ten songs, leading Seabrook to call it the ""truer"" collaboration. Eno himself stated ""We both worked on all the pieces all the time."" Eno would act as ""assistant director"" to Bowie, giving feedback to the musicians and suggesting new – and unusual – ways to approach the tracks. One of these ways was the employment of Eno's Oblique Strategies cards. According to Chris O'Leary, these cards were ""part-fortune cookie, part-Monopoly 'Chance' cards"", intended to spark creative ideas. Although these cards were used greatly throughout the Lodger sessions, Eno and Bowie only used them on ""Heroes"" when creating the instrumentals, including on ""V-2 Schneider"", ""Sense of Doubt"" and ""Moss Garden"".
Following the initial sessions in July, recording for ""Heroes"" became more sporadic, with overdubs, vocals and mixing lasting until August. Like its predecessor, lyrics weren't written or recorded until all but Bowie and Visconti departed. Seabrook characterises this stage of recording as ""sporadic bursts of inspiration surrounded by longer stretches of contemplation."" When making The Idiot and Lust for Life with Iggy Pop, Bowie became fascinated with Pop's ability to improvise lyrics while standing at the microphone. For ""Heroes"", he decided to use the same method. Visconti later attested: ""He'd never have a clue what he'd sing about until he actually walked in front of the microphone."" Bowie usually completed his vocals in only one or two takes; Visconti provided backing vocals in the same fashion. The final mixes were done at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, a studio that would become one of Bowie's mainstays. An engineer at Mountain, David Richards, would also become one of his regulars. Richards' assistant was Eugene Chaplin, the son of silent film star Charlie Chaplin.

Music and lyrics
As the second release of the Berlin Trilogy, the music on ""Heroes"" expands on the material found on its predecessor Low. The songs have been described by Consequence of Sound as art rock and experimental rock, while also further continuing Bowie's work in the electronic and ambient genres. Like its predecessor, the songs on ""Heroes"" emphasise tone and atmosphere rather than guitar-based rock. However, they are more positive in both tone and atmosphere than the songs of its predecessor; the author James Perone considers it more accessible, while Visconti described it as ""a very positive version of Low."" Biographer Paul Trynka writes that the record evokes ""both past and future"". It also follows the same structure as its predecessor, with side one featuring more conventional tracks, and side two featuring mostly instrumental tracks.
The author Peter Doggett writes that whereas Low featured lyrics of autobiographical nature, the lyrics of ""Heroes"" were ""oblique and often deliberately evasive"", and were sung with an ""astonishing"" amount of passion. Visconti recalled that lyrics were made up on the spot, with Bowie sometimes ad-libbing entire songs, singing ""at the top of his lungs"". Songs of this instance included ""Joe the Lion"", a tribute to the American artist Chris Burden, who was known for his outlandish publicity stunts, and ""Blackout"", which references the New York City blackout of 1977. Like the second side of Low, the imagery of the Berlin Wall dominates ""Heroes"" throughout; a kiss between Visconti and Maass at the foot of the Wall inspired a lyric for the title track. Bowie's vocal for ""'Heroes'"" goes from calm and playful to a near-scream, a style he called ""Bowie histrionics"". Musically, Fripp's guitar feedback dominates throughout, while the bass pulsates and Eno synthesisers blends in the background. Bowie explained the song is about ""facing reality and standing up to it"" and finding joyness in life. Buckley particularly highlights the lyric ""We can be heroes, just for one day"" as ""an acknowledgment that the future didn't belong to him anymore, [but] to everyone"".
""Sons of the Silent Age"" was the only song written before the sessions began and was originally intended to be the album's title track. The lyrics are influenced by the works of Jacques Brel and follow several characters that are, in O'Leary's words, ""part-homo superior/part-Bewlay Brothers"". Musically, the song is noted by biographers as different than the rest of the songs on the album, in that the themes present reflect ideals from the previous decade rather than the contemporary, while O'Leary likens its sound more to that of Hunky Dory (1971) than the rest of the album. Biographers also consider the album's closer, ""The Secret Life of Arabia"", as a precursor to what Bowie would explore on Lodger.
The instrumentals are described by Buckley as dark and gloomy. ""Sense of Doubt"" puts a repeating four-note piano motif against a set of synthesisers to paint an image of a barren landscape. Bowie plays the Japanese instrument koto on ""Moss Garden"" which, together with synths, evoke a sound resembling aeroplanes flying overhead; Bowie further emphasises his fascination with Japan by stating he's ""under Japanese influence"" in ""Blackout"". ""Moss Garden"" segues into ""Neuköln"", which is named after a district in Berlin. The track uses sound to capture the feeling of despair and desperation that the Turkish immigrants who lived there experienced.
The majority of Low was influenced by krautrock bands such as Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu! Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk name-checked both Bowie and Iggy Pop on the title track of Trans-Europe Express, which was Kraftwerk's response to the title track of Station to Station. Although the influence of Kraftwerk and Harmonia are less prominent on ""Heroes"" in favour of Edgar Froese, Bowie paid tribute by naming the album after Neu!'s track ""Hero"" from their album Neu! '75, while ""V-2 Schneider"" is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk's Florian Schneider. However, many British listeners assumed ""V-2"" was a reference to the type of rockets used by the German army in World War II. ""V-2 Schneider"" is also notable for having an off-beat saxophone part played by Bowie, who began the take on the wrong beat but decided he liked it better and kept it as is.

Artwork and release
The cover photo was taken by Japanese photographer Masayoshi Sukita. Like the artwork for Iggy Pop's The Idiot, the cover is a nod to German artist Erich Heckel's paintings Roquairol and Young Man. Pegg describes Bowie's pose as ""a wild-eyed Bowie locked in a rigid pose of serio-comic agitation, raising a flat palm as though he has just mimetically lifted the final mask of artifice from his face."" In an interview with Charles Shaar Murray of NME, Bowie said that the quotation marks in the title ""indicate a dimension of irony about the word 'heroes' or about the whole concept of heroism"". Visconti would later state that the album was ""heroic"" in that it was a very positive period of Bowie's life and during the making of the album, everyone felt like heroes. Regarding the title, Bowie said, ""I thought I'd pick on the only narrative song to use as the title,"" quipping he could have titled it The Sons of Silent Ages.
The title track was chosen as the lead single and released on 23 September 1977, with fellow album track ""V-2 Schneider"" as the B-side. It was released in a shortened edited form in the hopes of more airplay, but Buckley believes this edit results in the song losing some of its ""dramatic appeal"". It was supported by a music video, shot in Paris and directed by Nick Ferguson, that features Bowie in the same jacket on the album cover against a backdrop of white light. For the German and French releases of the single, titled ""'Helden'"" and ""'Héros'"", respectively, Bowie re-recorded his vocals in both languages, with lyrics translated by Antonia Maass for the German release. Despite the song's later mass acclaim, it was initially a failure, peaking at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and failing to chart in the US. Pegg and Chris O'Leary note that it wasn't until Bowie's Live Aid performance in 1985 did the song become recognised as a classic. Bowie later remarked in 2003: ""This is a strange phenomenon that happens with my songs Stateside. Many of the crowd favourites were never radio or chart hits, and '""Heroes""' tops them all.""

RCA issued ""Heroes"" on 14 October 1977, with the catalogue number RCA PL 12522. Its release came amid the punk rock movement, whose music and fashion had been influenced by Bowie. RCA marketed ""Heroes"" with the slogan ""There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie ..."" Trynka praises the slogan as ""a masterful piece of positioning that allowed David to remain aloof from a punk movement that, like glam before it, would turn into a parody of itself."" Unlike Low, Bowie promoted ""Heroes"" extensively, conducting numerous interviews and performing on various television programmes, including Marc, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas (where he recorded ""Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy"" with Crosby), and Top of the Pops (where he performed the title track).
The album was a commercial success in the UK, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and remained on the chart for 33 weeks. It fared less favourably in the US, where it peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, spending 19 weeks on the chart. Doggett writes that the album ended a string of eight top 20 albums in the US, becoming his worst-selling album there since 1971's Hunky Dory. RCA released ""Beauty and the Beast"" as the second single on 6 January 1978, with ""Sense of Doubt"" as the B-side. It became a minor success in the UK, peaking at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, staying on the chart for three weeks. NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray remarked that its ""jarring, threatening edge...obviously put off a great many of the floating singles buyers attracted by the intoxicating romanticism of its immediate predecessor"". The single was released in the US and Spain on a 12"" promo and in a five-minute extended form, which failed to chart despite having ""Fame"" as the B-side.

Critical reception
On release, ""Heroes"" received very positive reviews from music critics. Allan Jones of Melody Maker named it ""album of the year"", calling it and its predecessor ""among the most adventurous and notably challenging records yet thrust upon the rock audience."" Angus MacKinnon of NME also named it the magazine's ""album of the year"", calling it Bowie's ""most moving performance in years"" and commended the artist's growing maturity. Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine further praised the record, noting that Bowie appeared to be continuing the musical explorations of Low, while at the same time, allowing listeners time to ""catch up with Low."" Needs ultimately described the album as ""a strange, cold sometimes impenetrable album, but Bowie makes all these unlikely ingredients work."" Writing in Hit Parader, American musician and author Patti Smith praised it as ""a cryptic product of a high order of intelligence.""
The record was not without its detractors. Tim Lott of Record Mirror gave the album a more mixed assessment, calling it ""disjointed"" and criticised the instrumentals on side two as having less ""continuity"" than the ones found on Low. Lott further considered Bowie's vocals ""hollow"" and the lyrics ""opaque"". Overall, although he felt it was intriguing, he stated: ""As an album, ""Heroes"" stuns for just [the title] track. The rest is clever, but not brilliant and you expect no less from Bowie. In that sense it's a disappointment, a come-down from Low."" In the US, a reviewer for Billboard also gave a mixed assessment, calling it an ""extension"" of both ""Bowie's cosmic rock vision"" and Low, and overall felt the record was ""a musical excursion into a realm only Bowie himself can define."" In the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn lamented the way Bowie's ""fluctuating pop interests caused him to shift from style to style faster than his ability to master them"", ultimately calling it one of the artist's ""least arresting turns"". Creem's Trixie A. Balm liked side one but dismissed side two, ultimately finding ""Heroes"" ""doesn't rock"". In Canada, The Gazette's Juan Rodriguez commented on the ""melodramatic space-rock from the genre's leading practitioner"".
Some reviewers commented on Eno's contributions, including Bart Testa of Rolling Stone, who highlighted Eno's involvement. He contended that after Bowie's ""auteurist exploitation"" of the former on Low, ""Heroes"" ""prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie's dramatic instincts and Eno's unshakable sonic serenity"". The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less receptive to Eno's contributions, particularly the second side's instrumentals, saying that they are ""interesting background"" but ""merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged"", in comparison to ""their counterparts on Low"". In the Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, ""Heroes"" finished 21st in the voting for 1977's top album.

Legacy
Subsequent events
Upon completion of his promotional appearances for ""Heroes"", Bowie recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition Peter and the Wolf, released as an album in May 1978. Bowie later said that it was a Christmas present for his son, Duncan Jones, then seven years old. He then played then lead role in the David Hemmings-directed film Just a Gigolo. Released in February 1979, Just a Gigolo was panned by both critics and audiences. Bowie himself was critical of the film, calling it ""my 32 Elvis Presley movies rolled into one"" in an interview with NME.
After filming his scenes for Just a Gigolo in February 1978, Bowie began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. The Isolar II world tour, also known as ""the Stage tour"", lasted from March to the end of the year. Songs from both Low and ""Heroes"" made up the majority of the shows, while Ziggy Stardust-era songs and other hits from 1973 to 1976 were played. By now Bowie had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that the tour was ""Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."" Performances from the tour were released on the live album Stage in September the same year, and again from a different venue in 2018 on Welcome to the Blackout.

Critical legacy
Although ""Heroes"" was the best-received work of the Berlin Trilogy on release, in subsequent decades critical and public opinion has typically fallen in favour of Low as the more ground-breaking record owing to its daring experimental achievements. Pegg writes that the album is rather seen as an extension or refinement of its predecessor's achievements rather than a ""definitive new work"". Seabrook notes that Low had the advantage of being released first and seen as ""the greatest and canniest musical move"" of Bowie's entire career. However, compared to other records released in 1977, he writes that ""Heroes"" still ""sounds like a blast from the future"". Perone finds that the mix of songs and instrumentals makes ""Heroes"" feel more ""integrated""; having ""Sense of Doubt"", ""Moss Garden"" and ""Neuköln"" flow from one to the next ""give[s] the listener the feeling that [the album] was...meant to be experienced as a unified whole"". ""Heroes"" has nonetheless been regarded as one of Bowie's best and most influential works.
Retrospective reviews praise Bowie's growth as an artist and Fripp's contributions. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album, noting the growing artistic maturity compared to its predecessor. He further praised the addition of Fripp, stating that his guitar adds a greater ""musical foundation"" to the electronic sound. He ultimately writes: ""The difference between Low and ""Heroes"" [essentially] lies in the details, but the record is equally challenging and groundbreaking."" Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork similarly praised the record, calling Bowie's vocal performances some of his finest and highlighted Fripp as the standout. In a review in which he commended the entire Berlin Trilogy, Dombal identified ""Heroes"" as the album that indicated the most artistic growth for Bowie, after turning 30 and escaping years of drug addiction. Many reviewers and biographers have particularly highlighted the title track as one of Bowie's finest, with some considering it his greatest song.
In a 2013 readers' poll for Rolling Stone, ""Heroes"" was voted Bowie's eighth best album. Five years later, the writers of Consequence of Sound ranked ""Heroes"" as Bowie's fifth-greatest album, stating that ""The weary 'optimism' of ""Heroes"" is mesmerizing. Even on its gloomiest tracks, there's this upbeat, impassioned impression that everything's okay, even just for one day."" In 2020, Brian Kay of Classic Rock History ranked ""Heroes"", along with Low and Lodger, as Bowie's seventh greatest work, calling the trilogy a ""fascinating chapter"" in Bowie's life. In 2013, NME ranked the album 329th in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Influence
An early instance of the album's influence was John Lennon's comment in 1980 that, when making his album Double Fantasy, his ambition was to ""do something as good as ""Heroes""."" The Irish rock band U2 chose to record their Eno-produced Achtung Baby (1991) at Hansa by the Wall in Berlin in honour of ""Heroes"" being recorded there. Other artists inspired by ""Heroes"" include Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who referred to the ""unconscious influence"" of Bowie on his singing style, Vince Clarke, who called it a ""rebellion inspiration"", Ian Astbury of the Cult and Robyn Hitchcock. Scott Walker used ""Heroes"" as ""the reference album"" when making the Walker Brothers' Nite Flights (1978), according to engineer Steve Parker.

In 1997, American composer Philip Glass adapted the album into a classical piece, titled ""Heroes"" Symphony. A follow-up to his earlier 1992 adaptation of Low, titled ""Low"" Symphony, the piece is separated into six movements, each named after tracks on ""Heroes"". Like its predecessor, Glass acknowledged Eno's contributions as equal to Bowie's on the original album and credited the movements to the two equally. Unlike the ""Low"" Symphony, the ""Heroes"" Symphony was developed into a ballet by American choreographer Twyla Tharp. Both the ballet and Symphony were greeted with acclaim. Bowie and Glass remained in contact with each other until 2003 and discussed making a third symphony, which never came to fruition. After Bowie's death in 2016, Glass stated the two had talked about adapting Lodger for the third symphony, which adapted as his 12th symphony in 2019. Glass described Low and ""Heroes"" as ""part of the new classics of our time"".
The cover of Bowie's 2013 album, The Next Day, is an altered and obscured version of the ""Heroes"" cover. This version has the word ""'Heroes'"" crossed out and Bowie's face obscured by an opaque white box reading ""The Next Day"". Designer Jonathan Barnbrook explained that Bowie had a feeling of isolation when making ""Heroes"" and he wanted to recapture that feeling for The Next Day. He further emphasised: ""We tried out every single Bowie cover there's been, but it ended up as ""Heroes"" because it's such an iconic album, and the image on the front has the right kind of distance...The Next Day, in combination with the ""Heroes"" image, and what the album is saying about somebody who's looking back at his age...it just felt appropriate.""

Reissues
""Heroes"" has been reissued several times.  RCA reissued the album on vinyl in 1980 and released it on compact disc for the first time in the mid-1980s. It was subsequently reissued in 1991 by Rykodisc with two bonus tracks, including the outtake ""Abdulmajid"". A further CD release in 1999 by EMI/Virgin, without bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound.
In 2017, the album was remastered for the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set released by Parlophone that September. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately in February 2018. A volume shift in the 2017 remaster of the title track received ire from fans and critics, but Parlophone proceeded to describe it as intentional and unalterable, because of damages in the original master tapes. After the critical voices would not lessen, a statement was released on the official Bowie website announcing corrected replacement disks for the ""Heroes"" CD and LP; the replacement disc offer lasted until June 2018. The amended remaster featured on the replacement discs was also used for the standalone CD and LP release of ""Heroes"" in February 2018.

Karl Jenkins,"Sir Karl William Pamp Jenkins, , HonFLSW (born 17 February 1944) is a Welsh multi-instrumentalist and composer. His best known works include the song ""Adiemus"" (1995, from the Adiemus album series), Palladio (1995), The Armed Man (2000), his Requiem (2005) and his ""Stabat Mater"" (2008).
Jenkins was educated in music at Cardiff University and the Royal Academy of Music, and he is a fellow and an associate of the latter. He joined the jazz-rock band Soft Machine in 1972 and became the group's lead songwriter in 1974. He continued to work with Soft Machine until 1984, but has not been involved with any incarnation of the group since. He has composed music for advertising campaigns and has won the industry prize twice.

Biography
Early life and education
Jenkins was born and raised in Penclawdd, Gower, Wales (now part of Swansea). His mother was Swedish, and his father was Welsh. He received his initial musical instruction from his father, who was the local schoolteacher, chapel organist and choirmaster. He attended Gowerton Grammar School.
Jenkins studied music at Cardiff University and then commenced postgraduate studies in London at the Royal Academy of Music.

Early career: Graham Collier's group and Nucleus
For the bulk of his early career, Jenkins was known as a jazz and jazz-rock musician, playing baritone and soprano saxophones, keyboards and oboe, an unusual instrument in a jazz context. He joined jazz composer Graham Collier's group and later co-founded the jazz-rock group Nucleus, which won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1970. In 1971, Jenkins collaborated with Linda Hoyle on her album Pieces of Me, co-writing 8 of the 11 tracks, playing piano and oboe, as well as arranging and conducting the orchestra.

Soft Machine
In 1972, Jenkins joined the Canterbury jazz fusion rock band Soft Machine, playing saxophone, oboe and flute along with keyboard instruments. The group played venues including The Proms, Carnegie Hall, and the Newport Jazz Festival. The album Six, on which Jenkins first played with Soft Machine, won the Melody Maker British Jazz Album of the Year award in 1973. Jenkins also won the miscellaneous musical instrument section (as he did the following year). Soft Machine was voted best small group in the Melody Maker jazz poll of 1974. The albums in which Jenkins performed and composed were Six (1973), Seven (1973), Bundles (1975), Softs (1976) and Land of Cockayne (1981). Jenkins was the group's primary composer on Seven and the subsequent three albums.
After Mike Ratledge left the band in 1976, Soft Machine did not include any of its founding members, but kept recording on a project basis with line-ups revolving around Jenkins and drummer John Marshall. Although Melody Maker had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, Hugh Hopper, involved with the group since replacing bassist Kevin Ayers in 1968, cited Jenkins's ""third rate"" musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band, and the band of the late 1970s has been described by band member John Etheridge as wasting its potential.

Other works
In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD.

Works
Jenkins has created advertising music, twice winning the industry prize in that field. From the 1980s, he developed a relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty, starting with composing musics for their Levi's jeans ""Russian"" series. He composed a classical theme used by De Beers diamond merchants for their television advertising campaign focusing on jewellery worn by people otherwise seen only in silhouette. Jenkins later included this as the title track in a compilation called Diamond Music, and eventually created Palladio, using it as the theme of the first movement. Other arrangements have included advertisements for the Renault Clio.
As a composer, his breakthrough came with the crossover project Adiemus. Jenkins has conducted the Adiemus project in Japan, Germany, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as London's Royal Albert Hall and Battersea Power Station. The Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary (1995) album topped the classical album charts. It spawned a series of successors, each revolving around a central theme. In 2014 Jenkins released a tribute song for the 2014 Winter Olympics, performed by his new age music group also called Adiemus.
Jenkins was the first international composer and conductor to conduct the University of Johannesburg Kingsway Choir led by Renette Bouwer, during his visit to South Africa as the choir performed his The Armed Man: A mass for peace together with a 70-piece orchestra.
Jenkins' choral work The Peacemakers was first performed in New York City's Carnegie Hall on 16 January 2012. Jenkins conducted from the podium. The seventeen-movement piece features extracts from religious texts and works by notable humanitarians. A recording was released on 26 March 2012; it features the London Symphony Orchestra and several choirs, as well as guest vocalists and instrumentalists. Additional concerts in the UK and US took place later in the year.

Jenkins composed the music for the 2012 BBC Wales series The Story of Wales presented by Huw Edwards.
A work entitled The Healer – A Cantata For St Luke was premiered on 16 October 2014 (7:30 pm) in St Luke's Church, Grayshott, Hampshire, and was recorded and broadcast on Classic FM. The Healer received its US premiere at Carnegie Hall, New York on 19 January 2015.  In September 2015, the recording of the premiere of The Healer was released on CD by Warner Classics as part of the 8-disc boxed set Voices.
A compilation CD Still with the Music was also released in September 2015, coinciding with the publication of his autobiography of the same name.
On 8 October 2016 Jenkins' choral work Cantata Memoria: For the children, a response to the 1966 Aberfan disaster with a libretto by Mererid Hopwood and commissioned by S4C, premiered at the Wales Millennium Centre. The concert was broadcast the following evening on S4C and was released as an album by Deutsche Grammophon.

Musical style
Lyrics
Many of the songs written by Jenkins have specifically written phonetic lyrics, but they are not in any language. Instead, they are syllables intended to have a musical effect, but not to carry any specific meaning. This glossolalia is similar to the sounds of ""scat singing"", except that this latter artform sometimes emphasises of-the-moment improvisation as well.
The composer has said the lyrics to his ""Adiemus"" series of songs are in ""an invented language"", and have no particular meaning. He has observed, ""The text was written phonetically with the words viewed as instrumental sound, the idea being to maximise the melisma by removing the distraction, if one can call it that, of words”. Some listeners compare his lyrics to the Latin language, but other critics discount such a connection.
Other songs he has written use Biblical or literary texts for the lyrics.

Awards and achievements
Jenkins was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Wales in 2006. He has been made both a fellow (FRAM) and an associate (ARAM) of the Royal Academy of Music] in 2003, and a room has been named in his honour. He also has had fellowships at Cardiff University (2005), the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, Trinity College Carmarthen and Swansea Metropolitan University. In 2022, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (HonFLSW).
In 2008, Jenkins' The Armed Man was listed as No. 1 in Classic FM's ""Top 10 by living composers"".
He has been awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Leicester, the Chancellor's Medal by the University of Glamorgan and honorary visiting professorships at Thames Valley University, London College of Music and the ATriUM, Cardiff.
Jenkins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours and promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, in both cases for services to music. In the 2015 Birthday Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor ""for services to Composing and Crossing Musical Genres.""
Jenkins is joint president of the British Double Reed Society and Patron of the International Schools Choral Music Society (ISCMS).
In 2016, Jenkins received the BASCA Gold Badge Award for his unique contribution to music.
Jenkins' work Tros y Garreg (Welsh for Crossing the Stone) was performed at the coronation of King Charles III in 2023, with Jenkins in attendance.

Air (French band),"Air is a French music duo from Versailles, consisting of Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel. Their critically acclaimed debut album, Moon Safari, including the track ""Sexy Boy"", was an international success in 1998.  Its follow-up, The Virgin Suicides, was the score to Sofia Coppola's first film of the same name. The band has since released the albums 10 000 Hz Legend, Talkie Walkie, Pocket Symphony, Love 2, Le voyage dans la lune and Music for Museum. The band is influenced by a wide variety of musical styles and artists.

History
Formation
Nicolas Godin studied architecture at the École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Versailles, and Jean-Benoît Dunckel studied mathematics, before forming a band in 1995. Before founding Air, Dunckel and Godin played together in the band Orange with others such as Alex Gopher, Xavier Jamaux and Jean de Reydellet. The former two subsequently contributed to remixes of tracks recorded by Air.
Initially Godin worked alone, recording a demo with members of Funkadelic as his backing band before releasing his first entirely solo effort, ""Modular Mix"", which featured production by Étienne de Crécy.

Career
After making several remixes for other acts in the first half of the 1990s, Air recorded its first EP, Premiers Symptômes, in 1995. The band released its first album, Moon Safari, in 1998. Its first single, ""Sexy Boy"", was heavily played on alternative radio stations. The album received universal acclaim and became an international success. In 1999, Air composed the score The Virgin Suicides to Sofia Coppola's debut film of the same name; in 2012, Air wrote its second score to Georges Méliès' Le Voyage Dans La Lune. In the 2000s, Dunckel and Godin released four studio albums, including 10 000 Hz Legend (2001), Talkie Walkie (2004), Pocket Symphony (2007), and Love 2 (2009).

Other work
Air has often collaborated with Coppola. Air drummer and former Redd Kross member Brian Reitzell put together the soundtrack to 2003's Lost in Translation, including one original contribution by Air titled ""Alone in Kyoto"". The soundtrack for Coppola's October 2006 film Marie Antoinette featured a track by Air (""Il Secondo Giorno""). Air wrote and played the music of the album 5:55 by Anglo-French actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, which was released in August 2006. Air has recorded a DJ mix album, Late Night Tales: Air, for Azuli Records' Late Night Tales series. The release was initially scheduled for October 2005, but was delayed several times. It finally was released, complete with a new sleeve design, in September 2006. Darkel, a solo album by Dunckel, was released that same year.
City Reading (Tre Storie Western) (2003) started as an idea for a collaboration with contemporary Italian writer Alessandro Baricco, known for his unusual characterizations and lyrical, poetic style. Baricco contacted Air in summer 2002 with the idea to marry narration of texts from his book City with live original musical accompaniment. The performance premiered live in November 2002 at Rome's Teatro Valle and was deemed such a success that both parties resolved to make a full studio recording.

Influences and musical style
Air is associated with a variety of musical styles: electronica, space pop, dream pop, progressive rock, downtempo, chillout, trip hop, ambient, electronic pop and space rock. Dunckel grew up listening to both classical and electronic music, especially Kraftwerk, and also the 1960s and 1970s music of Serge Gainsbourg. He later took an interest in what he called the ""English dark rock"" of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, while being a fan of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Brian Eno and Cluster were two of the electronic acts who inspired him the most. He cites among his favorite artists: Maurice Ravel for classical music, François de Roubaix for music soundtracks and Siouxsie and the Banshees for pop music. Dunckel shared with Godin a special liking for the music of Michel Legrand, Philip Glass and Grace Jones. During his childhood, Godin was fascinated by the Beatles before later discovering the soul of Sly and the Family Stone, and film soundtracks like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Ennio Morricone. The duo were influenced by progressive rock pioneers Pink Floyd.
Air uses many of its studio instruments (including Moog synthesizers, the Korg MS-20, Wurlitzers and vocoders) on stage, where their ability to improvise is more clearly highlighted. The band performs the well-known tracks from the albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often collaborates (both in the studio and live) with artists like Beth Hirsch (Moon Safari), Françoise Hardy (""Jeanne""), Jean-Jacques Perrey (""Cosmic Bird""), Gordon Tracks (""Playground Love"" and ""Easy Going Woman"" – Gordon Tracks is a pseudonym of the French singer Thomas Mars from Phoenix), Beck (10 000 Hz Legend) and Jean-Michel Jarre (""Close Your Eyes"" from Jarre's Electronica 1: The Time Machine). They also invited Dave Palmer on their 2004 tour and drummer Earl Harvin, Vincent Taurelle and Steve Jones on their 2007 tour.

AIR as an acronym
The band has given conflicting information about whether Air is an acronym. In a clip aired in 2022, Godin told the BBC, ""AIR is a acronym. I don't know if you have the same word in English, but it's, uh, 'amour, imagination, and rêve'."" Dunckel apparently said the same thing, as the interview cuts to a separately filmed portion where Dunckel says ""...which means 'love, imagination, and dreaming'.""
However, in a 1998 interview for Australian magazine Rave, Godin reportedly denied the claim, saying ""No. Someone made that up, but it was a really nice thing to do. I wish I could have that idea.""

Arjen Lucassen,"Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960) is a Dutch singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer best known for his long-running progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon. Lucassen started his career in 1980 as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Dutch band Bodine as Iron Anthony, before joining Vengeance in 1984. After eight years he left the band, wanting to go into a more progressive direction, and released two years later an unsuccessful solo album entitled Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy under the nickname Anthony.
In 1995, Lucassen released an album uncredited to any artist called Ayreon: The Final Experiment, in which he sang, wrote every song and played most of the instruments. The album led to the creation of Ayreon; despite being relatively unknown at first, the project gained notable attention and praise with the release of its third album Into the Electric Castle, establishing Lucassen as a notable composer of rock operas. Following Ayreon's success, Lucassen has been involved in many other projects: he is the creator, composer and current guitarist/keyboardist of Star One, Guilt Machine, and The Gentle Storm, and the creator and former guitarist of Ambeon and Stream of Passion. He composes and writes most of his songs, but leaves the lyrics to his musical partners in some of his projects.
Lucassen plays a wide variety of instruments: his main instruments are guitar and keyboards, however he also plays bass, banjo and many others. Overall, in his career and including all his bands and projects (as principal instrumentalist/creative force or as a member), Lucassen has released twenty-six studio albums, four live albums, two EPs and seventeen singles. He has also made many minor participations alongside various artists including Shadow Gallery, After Forever, Within Temptation and Avantasia, and appears in over 50 albums.
Since the creation of Ayreon, Lucassen progressively made a name for himself under rock and metal reviewers, with many critics calling him a ""genius"", and praising his composition abilities and originality. In his review of 01011001, AllMusic reviewer Cosmo Lee stated ""Music this over the top almost defies criticism. Reviewing it is like reviewing the world's tallest building. It doesn't care; it just goes on and on.""

Career
Lucassen's love of music was sparked in the 60s, when he became a big fan of The Beatles. He decided to learn guitar when he heard Ritchie Blackmore playing in Made in Japan. One of his first bands was called Mover, which he joined around the age of 18.

Bodine (1980–1984)
In 1980, Lucassen joined Bodine via their drummer Gerrard Haitsma, who was also the drum teacher of Mover's drummer. Under the nickname Iron Anthony, he was featured on their second album, Bold as Brass (1982), and their third and final album, Three Times Running (1983).
Lucassen later recalled about his years with Bodine: ""on one side they were good musicians, extremely good musicians, the best drummer in Holland (Gerard Haitsma), an incredible guitar player and a very steddy [sic] bass player (Armand van der Hoff). And I actually learned how to play there, how to play very tight, how to play in tune, you know, to play solo not just fast but to play one note and do it good. But on the other hand, they were kind of boring guys, they were all 10 years older than me, they didn't like partying and stuff. And in those days I was young, I was 20, after the girls and after the party, you know. So it was a bit boring. And another problem in that band was that they didn't like melody, they were in love with AC/DC and stuff like that. And I always liked melodic music, already in those days I was into prog music. So I didn't like to be there, I wrote songs but they were just a little part of me.""
In 1984, Lucassen left Bodine to join Vengeance; they disbanded shortly after.

Vengeance (1984–1992)
In 1984, the newly created band Vengeance played as supporting act for Bodine. When Lucassen, who had been impressed by their performance, was later contacted by the band to ask if he knew any potential replacement for their guitarist who had just left, he proposed himself and joined the band, leaving Bodine.
Regarding their original self-titled album released in 1984, Lucassen stated in a 2002 interview that the album was ""horrible"", adding ""The songs were mostly finished when I joined the band. I think I wrote just two songs for that album and it was recorded very cheap, the sound is bad and the songs are not that good. So it's not a very strong album although you can already hear the potential"". The band later established themselves as one of the most successful bands of the Netherlands at the time. He also recalled a concert in Germany cancelled at the last moment because ""after the first night Vengeance wrecked the hotel, it was like $10,000 damage. We were not allowed to leave Germany, they took our equipment... so that was really sex, drugs and rock'n'roll!""
In 1989, the band was forced to fire their lead vocalist Leon Goewie, who was, according to Lucassen, ""really crazy on stage. The only problem was that he was also crazy offstage. But he also liked to have a stiff drink now and then, if you know what I mean"". Vengeance found little success with their new vocalist Ian Parry, and disbanded in 1992 after a surprisingly successful farewell tour.
While Lucassen pursued his solo career, Vengeance's label released The Last of the Fallen Heroes, promoted as a new studio album but actually a compilation of unfinished demos, in 1994. Goewie, who was heavily struggling as a musician after being fired from the band, later contacted Lucassen, asking him to write him songs. Lucassen wrote two songs, which were later featured on a new Vengeance album, Back from Flight 19, in 1997; despite participating to this new album, Lucassen did not re-join Vengeance. He later stated about Back from Flight 19 ""I'm not so proud of that album. There's a couple of good songs but it's definitely not Vengeance.""

Solo debuts (1992–1995)
After his departure, Lucassen first tried to create a new band, Planet Nine. However, according to his words in The Final Experiment book, ""nobody even wanted to touch it"". He released his first solo album, Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy, under the name ""Anthony"" in 1994. It was a commercial flop; according to Lucassen, ""people didn't understand it. It wasn't hard rock, it wasn't prog or something. People thought, 'What's that he is doing now? He must be crazy!'""
Remembering this period, Lucassen stated ""it was the period in my life when my girlfriend broke up with me, Vengeance broke up and I had no more record deal. So it was a horrible time"".

Ayreon's debut and fame (1995–2000)
After his first unsuccessful solo album, Lucassen began recording The Final Experiment, which was released in 1995 as Ayreon: The Final Experiment on a small Dutch label, Transmission Records, with no artist noted. The album featured a wide array of musical styles, ranging from folk to progressive metal. It was soon followed by Ayreon's first single, ""Sail Away to Avalon"".
One year later, Lucassen decided to continue the project started with The Final Experiment, using Ayreon as the project's official name, and released a second album titled Actual Fantasy. The album later became the exception in Ayreon's discography, as the only Ayreon release that does not feature a single overarching story concept. The single ""The Stranger from Within"" from this album was also released. It was a relative commercial failure. Lucassen decided to make one more album, and to stop Ayreon if this one did not become a commercial success.
The same year, Lucassen, tired after the complexity of Ayreon, decided to do ""something really simple, like punky or heavy versions of 1960s songs"" and released Strange Hobby, a cover album without artist name or any personnel credited at the idea of the record company to make people curious about the record. According to Lucassen, ""it didn't work because people knew how it was and they weren't so interested, so it was another flop. But I think it's good. Maybe the songs are too much alike, too short and after 10 songs you think, 'Oh, that's it?!' But I do like that album and I'm not ashamed that I did it.'""
In 1998 the commercially successful and critically acclaimed Ayreon album Into the Electric Castle was released. It is still currently considered one of the best albums in Lucassen's career. The good reception to the album made Lucassen decide to continue the project Ayreon.
The next two Ayreon albums, Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer and Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator, considered as two parts of the same story, were released simultaneously on 20 June 2000. The two sold well and were received positively, despite Part 1 being considered superior to Part 2 by most critics. ""Temple of the Cat"" from Part 1 was released as a single the same-year, and again the following year in an acoustic version.

First side projects; Ambeon and Star One (2000–2003)
In 2000 Lucassen created Ambeon, his first side-project since the creation of Ayreon, to explore a softer style of his music. The band consisted of him as composer and principal instrumentalist and then 14-year-old Astrid van der Veen as singer and lyricist. They released their only album Fate of a Dreamer in 2001, along with the single ""Cold Metal"". The album had a limited success. Ambeon's atmospheric sound draws from a wide variety of influences, including celtic, gothic, progressive music, and dark ambient. The songs on Fate of a Dreamer were mostly composed of different remixed pieces of songs from Ayreon albums. The name of the band was a play on the words ambient and Ayreon. The album went out of print shortly after its release and was considered rare, until Lucassen re-released it in December 2011, with the addition of a bonus CD containing previously unreleased tracks. Lucassen was not satisfied with the final result, stating ""it's a bit cold for me. It's too electronic, a bit too much computers... And I didn't know how well Astrid could sing for I didn't know her and she didn't know me"".
Van der Veen retired from music after the release of Fate of a Dreamer, leading to Lucassen stating that there'd most likely be no future Ambeon albums, despite the fact he would have liked it. Van der Veen eventually released a new record for herself in 2012 after a long battle with depression and addiction, but does not seem to intend on performing actively anymore.
In 2002, Lucassen created another side-project, entitled Star One; the only side-project to date he made more than one studio album with. Star One focused on four singers: Dan Swanö, Russell Allen, Floor Jansen and Damian Wilson; Lucassen played guitar, keyboards and hammond organ. Their first album Space Metal was released in 2002. The album also had limited success, although it was more successful than Ambeon. Live on Earth, the first live album in Lucassen's career which also included Ayreon songs, was released one year later.

The Human Equation and 01011001, Stream of Passion (2003–2008)
Four years after Universal Migrator, Lucassen released Ayreon's sixth album, The Human Equation. It was a commercial success, going No. 7 in the Dutch album charts, and some critics considered the album as Lucassen's best since Into the Electric Castle.)
Special editions of all Ayreon albums were released in 2004 when Lucassen switched label from Transmission to InsideOut Records; The new edition of The Final Experiment featured a bonus disc of newly recorded, semi-acoustic versions of songs from the album, while Actual Fantasy was entirely remixed and partially re-recorded, with the new version being titled Actual Fantasy: Revisited.
In 2005, Lucassen created Stream of Passion in 2005 to make a more conventional progressive metal band with symphonic and gothic inspirations. He also wanted to showcase the talents of his friend and Mexican female vocalist Marcela Bovio, who also sang on The Human Equation and who had won a contest on Lucassen's website.
He recruited second guitarist Lori Linstruth (his future girlfriend), keyboardist Alejandro Millán (Bovio's then-boyfriend), bassist Johan van Stratum (Bovio's future husband), and drummer Davy Mickers, and started the band. As with Astrid van der Veen for Ambeon, Lucassen was in charge of composing the music, while letting Bovio write the lyrics. They released the album Embrace the Storm in 2005. Like Lucassen had done with Star One, Stream of Passion toured and released a live album, Live in the Real World, in 2006. Also like Star One, the tour featured many Ayreon songs, as well as songs from the album. He finally left the band in 2007, as he had planned beforehand. The band continued successfully without him: They subsequently released three studio albums, The Flame Within, Darker Days and A War of Our Own, before amicably disbanding in 2016.
In 2008, Lucassen released a new Ayreon album, 01011001, which achieved commercial success, reaching No. 2 in the Dutch album chart.
The album was meant to be the conclusion of the Ayreon storyline, and after its release Lucassen decided to temporarily stop Ayreon, because he was not inspired to continue and also because many critics (despite the album being well reviewed) noted that there was nothing new being offered on 01011001; he believed that he might make more Ayreon albums in the future, but that they would not follow the same storyline.

Ayreon hiatus, focus on other projects (2008–2012)
In February 2009 Lucassen announced on his website his new side-project: Guilt Machine. The project features a very limited line-up compared to other Lucassen side projects: himself on many instruments and backing vocals, Jasper Steverlinck (Arid) on lead vocals, Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree) on drums and Lori Linstruth (ex-Stream of Passion) on lead guitar. Their first album On This Perfect Day, released the same year, received a very good critical reception but was Lucassen's least commercially successful album in many years.
In 2010, Lucassen reunited the six other members of Star One, inactive since 2003, and released the band's second studio album Victims of the Modern Age. The album received critical acclaim and was a big commercial success. In December 2011 the Ambeon album Fate of a Dreamer, like the older Ayreon albums, was re-released with bonus tracks.
At the same time as that the Ambeon album was re-released, Lucassen was already busy composing and recording his next project. On 23 April 2012, Lucassen released Lost in the New Real, his first solo album since Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy 18 years before. On this album Lucassen sang all leading vocals, wrote all lyrics and played almost all instruments. Also, he asked the Dutch actor Rutger Hauer to provide narration between the tracks, similar to as he had done on Into The Electric Castle. Artwork for this album was done by Claudio Bergamin.

Ayreon revival and The Gentle Storm (2012–2017)
On 23 August 2012, Lucassen published on his YouTube channel that he started composing ""a new project"". On 9 October 2012, he revealed it via YouTube again to be a new Ayreon album, planned for 2013.
Responding to fan comments on his website, Lucassen stated on 12 October that it would probably take a year before the album was completed. He also stated that the album would be the start of a new story apart from the previous Ayreon albums, and confirmed the presence of Ed Warby as usual.
On late 2012, Tobias Sammet announced that Arjen would make some guest lead guitar works in his new Avantasia album, The Mystery of Time. This marked the second time both musicians have worked together, the first having been the Ayreon EP Elected, on the title-song, in which Tobias sang guest vocals.
On 26 March 2013, Lucassen revealed the name of the next Ayreon's album, The Theory of Everything. This album was released on 25 October and received positive reviews.
On 22 April 2014, Lucassen revealed that his new project would be a collaboration with Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen, who previously collaborated with him in Ayreon albums Into the Electric Castle and 01011001. He described it as ""an epic double concept album, a combination of 'classical meets metal' and 'acoustic folk'."" Lucassen's most recurrent collaborator Ed Warby was featured once again on drums, and it was his very first album featuring double bass among the instruments. He confirmed that Johan van Stratum from his former band Stream of Passion would play bass on the album. Also, due to ""unforeseen problems"", Warby had to re-record all his drums part in one day only.
On 2 September 2014, Lucassen revealed that his collaboration with van Giersbergen was actually a new band, called The Gentle Storm. A cover EP entitled The Gentle Storm Exclusive Tour CD, and their first album, The Diary, were both released in 2015, with van Giersbergen writing all the lyrics and him composing the music. The band toured in 2015, without him; however he was featured on a few acoustic shows by the band in the Netherlands.
Between 18 and 20 September 2015, a live version of The Human Equation, directed by Lucassen's former manager Yvette Boertje and featuring most of the original album's singers and musicians, took place for four shows. Although he was not involved in the creative process, Lucassen appeared at the end of each show, and acted as producer and mixer for the DVD/live album, entitled The Theater Equation and released on 17 June 2016.
On 6 October 2016, Lucassen's next project was announced to be a new Ayreon studio album. After revealing the cast one by one during the following months, he revealed its cover art and title, The Source, on 19 January 2017. The album was released on 28 April 2017 and was a commercial success, topping the albums charts in the Netherlands at its release.

Focus on Ayreon live performances (2017–present)
In November 2016, Lucassen announced the first ever official Ayreon concerts for September 2017, entitled Ayreon Universe. The show featured 16 singers and 11 instrumentalists, all of which had previously worked together with Lucassen on his studio albums. Unlike The Theater Equation, it consisted of unrelated songs from Ayreon performed after each other as in a traditional concert, with a few songs from Star One featured as well. One of the performances was released as a live album/DVD on 30 March 2018, titled Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live.
On 7 December 2017, Lucassen stated that a new Ayreon concert would take place on 22 June 2018 at Graspop Metal Meeting, where they would headline the Marquee stage. It featured the same instrumentalists as the Ayreon Universe shows and most of its vocalists, along with Simone Simons, Barry Hay and Tom S. Englund, who had never performed live with Ayreon before, and Mark Jansen, who had never collaborated with Lucassen before; Lucassen himself also performed a few songs.
Between 13 and 15 September 2019, the album Into the Electric Castle was performed in Tilburg in its entirety similarly to The Theater Equation in 2015, this time as official Ayreon performances. Fish, Anneke van Giersbergen, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Edwin Balogh, and George Oosthoek returned from the original cast, alongside Ed Warby and flutist Thijs van Leer, who also performed on the original album. Simone Simons and Mark Jansen of Epica, Praying Mantis singer John Jaycee Cuijpers, Marcela Bovio, Bovio's husband and VUUR bassist Johan van Stratum, and Ex Libris members Dianne van Giersbergen and Bob Wijtsma were also featured, with actor John de Lancie acting as narrator. It was released as the live album Electric Castle Live and Other Tales on 27 March 2020.
Ayreon was supposed to headline the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany on 18 July 2020 to perform Into the Electric Castle once again, however the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 8 May 2020, Lucassen revealed on his YouTube channel that his next album would be an Ayreon album, titled Transitus and to be released the same year; the album has been released alongside a tie-in comic book on 25 September 2020.
Beginning 9 February 2021 on his Facebook page, Lucassen began teasing a new Star One album, On 6 October 2021 he revealed that it would be titled Revel in Time. The album was released on 18 February 2022 on different formats, followed by re-releases of Star One (11 March 2022) and Victims of the Modern Age (1 April 2022).
On 19 January 2023, it was announced that Lucassen had formed a new band called Arjen Lucassen's Supersonic Revolution. On 19 May 2023, they released the 1970s influenced album Golden Age of Music.

Personal life
Lucassen stated that to him, ""Music is everything. Both listening and creating. Even if I wouldn't be successful I would be creating music. Music chose me, I didn't choose music. I have no choice in the matter whatsoever!""
According to Lucassen, his self-made motto is ""the meaning of life is to give life meaning"", a sentence which he included in the Ayreon song ""The Sixth Extinction"" from 01011001, and considers himself ""a very rational man. I believe in science"".

Family and relationships
Lucassen has an older brother, Gjalt, who speaks through a megaphone on the song ""I'm The Slime"" from his solo album Lost in the New Real. Every Lucassen album contains a ""Gjalt joke"" in its booklet, in which he refers to his brother. This is, at times, done in both a joking and/or mocking fashion, as for years he and Gjalt have had a rocky relationship and haven't always gotten along. He was married to Jolanda Verduijn, who appeared as bassist on The Final Experiment, until they divorced in 2006/2007.
Lucassen is currently in a relationship with American guitarist and lyricist Lori Linstruth, who left Sweden to move in with him. She is his former bandmate from both Stream of Passion and Guilt Machine, and was featured in several Ayreon albums. Despite retiring as an active performer in 2010, she still acts as his manager, a role she has held since 2007, and is responsible for various other tasks on his albums; she notably co-wrote the story and lyrics of the Ayreon album The Theory of Everything. According to Lucassen, Linstruth supervises the making of all his works, notably his lyrics as English is her native language, and she is also an English teacher.

Health issues
During the recordings of The Human Equation from 2003 to 2004, Lucassen suffered from ""increasing lower back problems"". The Doctors gave him an MRI examination revealing he was suffering from a hernia; he had his examination filmed in order to use it for a video shoot, ""as the 'Me' character [from The Human Equation] would also have needed a scan after his car accident"".
Lucassen has suffered from permanent anosmia since 2007. The same year, he sank into a depression which required medical help, due to the disease, his constant work over the last years, and his recent divorce with Verduijn resulting in him living on his own.
On 3 September 2012, he revealed on his Facebook page that he had been suffering from an incurable tinnitus for the past two months.

Discography
1 Lucassen also contributed to the 1997 album Back from Flight 19, but was not credited as band member.2 Despite being considered by Lucassen as a compilation of unfinished demos, the album was released as a new studio album with Lucassen credited as band member.

Interview with Arjen on Lebmetal.com October 2009"
Ambient house,"Ambient house is a downtempo subgenre of house music that first emerged in the late 1980s, combining elements of acid house and ambient music. The genre developed in chill-out rooms and specialist clubs as part of the UK's dance music scene. It was most prominently pioneered by the Orb and the KLF, along with artists such as Global Communication, Irresistible Force, Youth, and 808 State. The term was used vaguely, and eventually fell out of favor as more specific subgenres were recognized.

Genre
AllMusic describes ""ambient house"" as an ""early categorical marker"" for music ""appropriating certain primary elements of acid house music -- midtempo, four-on-the-floor beats; synth pads and strings; soaring vocal samples -- used in a dreamier, more atmospheric fashion"". Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World noted common elements: repeated synthesizer arpeggios that are gradually modulated; reverbed snippets of dialogue from film, radio, or relaxation tapes; and samples of other musical works drifting in and out of the mix. 
Ambient house is sometimes conflated with ""chill-out"", and AllMusic acknowledges that the term ""ambient house"" is now rarely used, replaced by a morass of more specific genres and terms.

History
Origins
Ambient house was, in the words of John Bush of AllMusic, ""virtually invented"" by UK band the Orb - Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty - during The Land of Oz events at the night-club Heaven, while Dom Phillips at Mixmag has said the Orb ""kickstarted the whole ambient business"". Neil McCormick has similarly credited Cauty and Paterson with inventing the genre, in The Daily Telegraph. In 1989, Paul Oakenfold ran the acid house night at Heaven, and Paterson ran a chill-out counterpart in the White Room with Cauty and Youth. There, Paterson spun Brian Eno, Pink Floyd, and 10CC songs at low volume and accompanied them with multiscreen video projections. Around the same time, in the East End of London, so-called spacetime parties were held at Cable Street.  These parties, organized by Jonah Sharp, were designed to encourage conversation rather than dance, and featured Mixmaster Morris (also known as the Irresistible Force), another pioneer of the genre.

The Orb released the twenty-minute track ""A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld"" as a single in October 1989, making it to the UK singles chart at No. 78. The track featured ""bright, translucent sounds"" and ""tinkl[ing]"" keyboards, as well as heavily sampling Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"". Other early ambient house records included ""Sueño Latino"" (1989) by the Italian group of the same name (based on Manuel Gottsching's 1984 album E2-E4), ""Pacific State"" (1989) by 808 State, ""Flotation"" (1990) by the Grid, ""Paradise"" (1989) by Quadrophenia, ""Journeys Into Rhythm"" (1989) by Audio One, and ""Natural Thing"" (1990) by Innocence.

Commercial peak
In February 1990, Cauty's other band the KLF, a partnership with Bill Drummond, released the album Chill Out: ""one of the initial works in the ambient house canon"" and ""essential"" according to John Bush at AllMusic, ""one of the most influential records in ambient house music"" according to Pitchfork, and an album with which the KLF were ""claiming pre-eminence in the ambient house field"" (Ira Robbins of Trouser Press). In a press release for Chill Out, Scott Piering claimed that the term ""ambient house"" had been invented ""off-the-cuff"" by the KLF. After leaving the Orb in April 1990, Cauty finished work on Space, which was originally intended to be the Orb's debut album, and Paterson's Orb went on to create the single ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" with Youth, both important works of ambient house. The KLF retired from the music industry in 1992, In 1991, the Orb released the album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, featuring both of their previous singles.  Combining Moog synthesizers with religious chorales and audio clips of the Apollo 11 rocket launch, the Orb popularized the ""spacy"" sound of ambient house. The album would influence subsequent dub influenced electronic music. 
Ambient house became a label for artists beyond the KLF and the Orb, including Irresistible Force, the Future Sound of London, and Orbital. Ultramarine's 1991 album Every Man and Woman is a Star was also lumped in with the chillout/ambient house scene of the Orb and the KLF. Other ambient house recordings emerged by artists such as the Grid (""Flotation"" in 1990), Interplay (""Synthesis"" in 1991), and the Future Sound of London (""Papua New Guinea"" in 1991). In 1992, the Orb released the single ""Blue Room"" which was to become their most successful, reaching eighth place in the UK singles chart. At forty minutes, it was the longest single to reach the UK charts. An edited form of it appeared on the Orb album U.F.Orb later that year.  U.F.Orb reached No. 1 in the UK albums chart; AllMusic called it ""the commercial and artistic peak of the ambient-house movement."" In the years after the release of their live album, Live 93, the Orb largely stopped their ambient-house music production, instead concentrating on producing more  ""metallic""  music.
In 1994, Global Communication released their largely beat-free album 76:14; AllMusic called it ""a notable high point of the ambient house movement."" Slant Magazine called it ""one of several universally celebrated ambient house records,"" and labeled each track ""its own spacey symphony, etched with ticking clocks, soft piano lines and tidal white noise.""

Ambient music,"Ambient music is a genre of music that emphasizes tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. It may lack net composition, beat, or structured melody. It uses textural layers of sound that can reward both passive and active listening and encourage a sense of calm or contemplation. The genre is said to evoke an ""atmospheric"", ""visual"", or ""unobtrusive"" quality. Nature soundscapes may be included, and the sounds of acoustic instruments such as the piano, strings and flute may be emulated through a synthesizer.
The genre originated in the 1960s and 1970s, when new musical instruments were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. It was presaged by Erik Satie's furniture music and styles such as musique concrète, minimal music, Jamaican dub reggae and German electronic music, but was prominently named and popularized by British musician Brian Eno in 1978 with his album Ambient 1: Music for Airports; Eno opined that ambient music ""must be as ignorable as it is interesting"". It saw a revival towards the late 1980s with the prominence of house and techno music, growing a cult following by the 1990s. Ambient music may have elements of new-age music and drone music, as some works may use sustained or repeated notes.

Ambient music did not achieve large commercial success, being criticized as everything from ""dolled-up new age, [..] to boring and irrelevant technical noodling"". Nevertheless, it has attained a certain degree of acclaim throughout the years, especially in the Internet age. Due to its relatively open style, ambient music often takes influences from many other genres, ranging from classic, avant-garde music, experimental music, folk, jazz, and world music, amongst others.

History
Origins
As an early 20th-century French composer, Erik Satie used such Dadaist-inspired explorations to create an early form of ambient/background music that he labeled ""furniture music"" (Musique d'ameublement). This he described as being the sort of music that could be played during a dinner to create a background atmosphere for that activity, rather than serving as the focus of attention.
In his own words, Satie sought to create ""a music...which will be part of the noises of the environment, will take them into consideration. I think of it as melodious, softening the noises of the knives and forks at dinner, not dominating them, not imposing itself. It would fill up those heavy silences that sometime fall between friends dining together. It would spare them the trouble of paying attention to their own banal remarks. And at the same time it would neutralize the street noises which so indiscreetly enter into the play of conversation. To make such music would be to respond to a need.""
In 1948, French composer & engineer, Pierre Schaeffer coined the term musique concrète. This experimental style of music used recordings of natural sounds that were then modified, manipulated or effected to create a composition. Shaeffer's techniques of using tape loops and splicing are considered to be the precursor to modern day sampling.
In 1952, John Cage released his famous three-movement composition 4'33 which is a performance of complete silence for four minutes and thirty-three seconds. The piece is intended to capture the ambient sounds of the venue/location of the performance and have that be the music played. Cage has been cited by seminal artists such as Brian Eno as influence.

1960s
In the 1960s, many music groups experimented with unusual methods, with some of them creating what would later be called ambient music.
In the summer of 1962, composers Ramon Sender and Morton Subotnick founded The San Francisco Tape Music Center which functioned both as an electronic music studio and concert venue. Other composers working with tape recorders became members and collaborators including Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. Their compositions, among others, contributed to the development of minimal music (also called minimalism), which shares many similar concepts to ambient music such as repetitive patterns or pulses, steady drones, and consonant harmony.
Many records were released in Europe and the United States of America between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s that established the conventions of the ambient genre in the anglophone popular music market. Some 1960s records with ambient elements include Music for Yoga Meditation and Other Joys and Music for Zen Meditation by Tony Scott, Soothing Sounds for Baby by Raymond Scott, and the first record of the Environments album series by Irv Teibel.
In the late 1960s, French composer Éliane Radigue composed several pieces by processing tape loops from the feedback between two tape recorders and a microphone. In the 1970s, she then went on to compose similar music almost exclusively with an ARP 2500 synthesiser, and her long, slow compositions have often been compared to drone music. In 1969, the group COUM Transmissions were performing sonic experiments in British art schools. Pearls Before Swine's 1968 album Balaklava features the sounds of birdsong and ocean noise, which were to become tropes of ambient music.""

1970s
Developing in the 1970s, ambient music stemmed from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period.
Between 1974 and 1976, American composer Laurie Spiegel created her seminal work The Expanding Universe, created on a computer-analog hybrid system called GROOVE. In 1977, her composition, Music of the Spheres was included on Voyager 1 and 2's Golden Record.
In April 1975, Suzanne Ciani gave two performances on her Buchla synthesizer – one at the WBAI Free music store and one at Phil Niblock's loft. These performances were released on an archival album in 2016 entitled Buchla Concerts 1975. According to the record label, these concerts were part live presentation, part grant application and part educational demonstration.
However, it was not until Brian Eno coined the term in the mid-70s that ambient music was defined as a genre. Eno went on to record 1975's Discreet Music with this in mind, suggesting that it be listened to at ""comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility"", referring to Satie's quote about his musique d'ameublement.
Other contemporaneous musicians creating ambient-style music at the time included Jamaican dub musicians such as King Tubby, Japanese electronic music composers such as Isao Tomita and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel's Environments series, and German experimental bands such as Popol Vuh, Cluster, Kraftwerk, Harmonia, Ash Ra Tempel and Tangerine Dream. Mike Orme of Stylus Magazine describes the work of Berlin school musicians as ""laying the groundwork"" for ambient.
The impact the rise of the synthesizer in modern music had on ambient as a genre cannot be overstated; as Ralf Hutter of early electronic pioneers Kraftwerk said in a 1977 Billboard interview: ""Electronics is beyond nations and colors...with electronics everything is possible. The only limit is with the composer"".  The Yellow Magic Orchestra developed a distinct style of ambient electronic music that would later be developed into ambient house music.

Brian Eno
The English producer Brian Eno is credited with coining the term ""ambient music"" in the mid-1970s. He said other artists had been creating similar music, but that ""I just gave it a name. Which is exactly what it needed ... By naming something you create a difference. You say that this is now real. Names are very important."" He used the term to describe music that is different from forms of canned music like Muzak.
In the liner notes for his 1978 album Ambient 1: Music for Airports, Eno wrote:

Whereas the extant canned music companies proceed from the basis of regularizing environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncrasies, Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. Whereas conventional background music is produced by stripping away all sense of doubt and uncertainty (and thus all genuine interest) from the music, Ambient Music retains these qualities. And whereas their intention is to ""brighten"" the environment by adding stimulus to it (thus supposedly alleviating the tedium of routine tasks and leveling out the natural ups and downs of the body rhythms) Ambient Music is intended to induce calm and a space to think. Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.
Eno, who describes himself as a ""non-musician"", termed his experiments ""treatments"" rather than traditional performances.

1980s
In the late 70s, new-age musician Laraaji began busking in New York parks and sidewalks, including Washington Square Park. It was there that Brian Eno heard Laraaji playing and asked him if he'd like to record an album. Day of Radiance released in 1980, was the third album in Eno's Ambient series. Although Laraaji had already recorded a number of albums, this one gave him international recognition. Unlike other albums in the series, Day of Radiance featured mostly acoustic instruments instead of electronics.
In the mid-1980s, the possibilities to create a sonic landscape increased through the use of sampling.  By the late 1980s, there was a steep increase in the incorporation of the computer in the writing and recording process of records. The sixteen-bit Macintosh platform with built-in sound and comparable IBM models would find themselves in studios and homes of musicians and record makers.
However, many artists were still working with analogue synthesizers and acoustic instruments to produce ambient works.
In 1983, Midori Takada recorded her first solo LP Through the Looking Glass in two days. She performed all parts on the album, with diverse instrumentation including percussion, marimba, gong, reed organ, bells, ocarina, vibraphone, piano and glass Coca-Cola bottles.
Between 1988 and 1993, Éliane Radigue produced three hour-long works on the ARP 2500 which were subsequently issued together as La Trilogie De La Mort.
Also in 1988, founding member and director of the San Francisco Tape Music Centre, Pauline Oliveros coined the term ""deep listening"" after she recorded an album inside a huge underground cistern in Washington which has a 45-second reverberation time. The concept of Deep Listening then went on to become ""an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation"".

1990s
By the early 1990s, artists such as the Orb, Aphex Twin, Seefeel, the Irresistible Force, Biosphere, and the Higher Intelligence Agency gained commercial success and were being referred to by the popular music press as ambient house, ambient techno, IDM or simply ""ambient"". The term chillout emerged from British ecstasy culture which was originally applied in relaxed downtempo ""chillout rooms"" outside of the main dance floor where ambient, dub and downtempo beats were played to ease the tripping mind.
British artists such as Aphex Twin (specifically: Selected Ambient Works Volume II, 1994), Global Communication (76:14, 1994), The Future Sound of London (Lifeforms, 1994, ISDN, 1994), the Black Dog (Temple of Transparent Balls, 1993), Autechre (Incunabula, 1993, Amber, 1994), Boards of Canada, and The KLF's Chill Out, (1990), all took a part in popularising and diversifying ambient music where it was used as a calming respite from the intensity of the hardcore and techno popular at that time.
Other global ambient artists from the 1990s include American composers Stars of the Lid (who released 5 albums during this decade), and Japanese artist Susumu Yokota whose album Sakura (1999) featured what Pitchfork magazine called ""dreamy, processed guitar as a distinctive sound tool"".

2000s–present
By the late 2000s to present, ambient music also gained widespread recognition on YouTube, with uploaded pieces, usually ranging from one to eight hours long, getting over millions of hits. Such videos are usually titled, or are generally known as, ""relaxing music"", and may be influenced by other music genres. Ambient videos assist online listeners with yoga, study, sleep (see music and sleep), massage, meditation and gaining optimism, inspiration, and creating peaceful atmosphere in their rooms or other environments.
Many uploaded ambient videos tend to be influenced by biomusic where they feature sounds of nature, though the sounds would be modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the sounds as part of the ambience. Such natural sounds oftentimes include those of a beach, rainforest, thunderstorm and rainfall, among others, with vocalizations of animals such as bird songs being used as well. Pieces containing binaural beats are common and popular uploads as well, which provide music therapy and stress management for the listener.
iTunes and Spotify have digital radio stations that feature ambient music, which are mostly produced by independent labels.
Acclaimed ambient music of this era (according to Pitchfork magazine) include works by Max Richter, Julianna Barwick, Grouper, William Basinski, Oneohtrix Point Never, and the Caretaker. In 2011, American composer Liz Harris recording as Grouper released the album AIA: Alien Observer, listed by Pitchfork at number 21 on their ""50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time"". In 2011, Julianna Barwick released her first full-length album The Magic Place. Heavily influenced by her childhood experiences in a church choir, Barwick loops her wordless vocals into ethereal soundscapes. It was listed at number 30 on Pitchfork's 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time. After several self-released albums, Buchla composer, producer and performer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith was signed to independent record label Western Vinyl in 2015. In 2016, she released her second official album EARS. It paired the Buchla synthesizer with traditional instruments and her compositions were compared to Laurie Spiegel and Alice Coltrane. Kaitlyn has also collaborated with other well-known Buchla performer, Suzanne Ciani. Iggy Pop's 2019 album Free features ambient soundscapes. Mallsoft, a subgenre of vaporwave, features various ambient influences, with artists such as Cat System Corp. and Groceries exploring ambient sounds typical of malls and grocery stores.

Related and derivative genres
Ambient dub
Ambient dub is a fusion of ambient music with dub. The term was first coined by Birmingham's now defunct label ""Beyond Records"" in early 1990s. The label released series of albums Ambient Dub Volume 1 to 4 that inspired many artists, including Bill Laswell, who used the same phrase in his music project Divination, where he collaborated with other artists in the genre. Ambient dub adopts dub styles made famous by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists from the 1960s to the early 1970s, using DJ-inspired ambient electronica, complete with all the inherent drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It often features layering techniques and incorporates elements of world music, deep bass lines and harmonic sounds. According to David Toop, ""Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation."" Notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, the Orb, Gaudi, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground as well as Banco de Gaia and Leyland Kirby

Ambient house
Ambient house is a musical category founded in the late 1980s that is used to describe acid house featuring ambient music elements and atmospheres. Tracks in the ambient house genre typically feature four-on-the-floor beats, synth pads, and vocal samples integrated in an atmospheric style. Ambient house tracks generally lack a diatonic center and feature much atonality along with synthesized chords. The Dutch Brainvoyager is an example of this genre. Illbient is another form of ambient house music.

Ambient techno
Ambient techno is a music category emerging in the late 1980s that is used to describe ambient music atmospheres with the rhythmic and melodic elements of techno. Notable artists include Aphex Twin, B12, Autechre, and the Black Dog.

Ambient industrial
Ambient industrial is a hybrid genre of industrial and ambient music. A ""typical"" ambient industrial work (if there is such a thing) might consist of evolving dissonant harmonies of metallic drones and resonances, extreme low frequency rumbles and machine noises, perhaps supplemented by gongs, percussive rhythms, bullroarers, distorted voices or anything else the artist might care to sample (often processed to the point where the original sample is no longer recognizable). Entire works may be based on radio telescope recordings, the babbling of newborn babies, or sounds recorded through contact microphones on telegraph wires.

Ambient pop
Ambient pop is a style that developed in the 1980s and 1990s contemporaneously with post-rock; it has also been regarded as an extension of the dream pop movement and the atmospheric style of shoegaze. It incorporates structures that are common to rock and pop music while exploring ""electronic textures and atmospheres that mirror the hypnotic, meditative qualities of ambient music"", which is also central to indie electronic music. Ambient pop utilizes the musical experimentation of psychedelia and the repetitive traits of minimalism, krautrock and techno as prevalent influences. Despite being an extension of dream pop, it is distinguished by its adoption of ""contemporary electronic idioms, including sampling, although for the most part live instruments continue to define the sound.""
David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy with ambient music pioneer Brian Eno, both of whom were inspired during the production of the albums in the trilogy by German kosmische Musik bands and minimalist composers, was regarded as influential on ambient pop. The track ""Red Sails"" from the trilogy's third album, Lodger (1979), has been retroactively described as a ""piece of ambient pop"", prominently incorporating a motorik drum rhythm. English art rock band Japan's song ""Taking Islands in Africa"" from Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) was described by AllMusic critic Stewart Mason as a forecast of ""the ambient pop direction Japan (and leader David Sylvian) would take for the rest of their careers"".
Dream pop band Slowdive's 1995 album Pygmalion heavily incorporated elements of ambient electronica and psychedelia, influencing many ambient pop bands and subsequently being regarded as a landmark album in the genre; Pitchfork critic Nitsuh Abebe described the album's songs as ""ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock [bands] like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride"". The genre continued to stylistically progress in the 2000s with bands including Broadcast, Múm, Dntel and the Postal Service.

Dark ambient
Brian Eno's original vision of ambient music as unobtrusive musical wallpaper, later fused with warm house rhythms and given playful qualities by the Orb in the 1990s, found its opposite in the style known as dark ambient. Populated by a wide assortment of personalities—ranging from older industrial and metal experimentalists (Scorn's Mick Harris, Current 93's David Tibet, Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton) to electronic boffins (Kim Cascone/PGR, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia), Japanese noise artists (K.K. Null, Merzbow), and latter-day indie rockers (Main, Bark Psychosis) – dark ambient features toned-down or entirely missing beats with unsettling passages of keyboards, eerie samples, and treated guitar effects. Like most styles related in some way to electronic/dance music of the '90s, it's a very nebulous term; many artists enter or leave the style with each successive release. Related styles include ambient industrial (see below) and isolationist ambient.

Space music
Space music, also spelled ""Spacemusic"", includes music from the ambient genre as well as a broad range of other genres with certain characteristics in common to create the experience of contemplative spaciousness.
Space music ranges from simple to complex sonic textures sometimes lacking conventional melodic, rhythmic, or vocal components, generally evoking a sense of ""continuum of spatial imagery and emotion"", beneficial introspection, deep listening and sensations of floating, cruising or flying.
Space music is used by individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to stimulate relaxation, contemplation, inspiration and generally peaceful expansive moods and soundscapes. Space music is also a component of many film soundtracks and is commonly used in planetariums, as a relaxation aid and for meditation.

Film soundtracks
Examples of films with soundtracks that feature some, or extensive, usage of ambient music include, Forbidden Planet (1956), THX 1138 (1971), Solaris (1972), Blade Runner (1982), The Thing (1982), Dune (1984),, Heathers (1988), Akira (1988), Ghost in the Shell (1995),  Titanic (1997), Traffic (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), Solaris (2002), The Passion of the Christ (2004), Pride & Prejudice (2005), Moon (2009), The Social Network (2010), Cosmopolis (2012), Her (2013), Enemy (2013), Drive (2011),  Interstellar (2014), Gone Girl (2014), The Revenant (2015), Columbus (2017), Mandy (2018), Annihilation (2018), Ad Astra (2019), Chernobyl (2019) and Dune (2021), among many others.

In the 1970s, she then went on to compose similar music almost exclusively with an ARP 2500 synthesiser, and her long, slow compositions have often been compared to drone music. In 1969, the group COUM Transmissions were performing sonic experiments in British art schools. Pearls Before Swine's 1968 album Balaklava features the sounds of birdsong and ocean noise, which were to become tropes of ambient music.""

1970s
Developing in the 1970s, ambient music stemmed from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period.
Between 1974 and 1976, American composer Laurie Spiegel created her seminal work The Expanding Universe, created on a computer-analog hybrid system called GROOVE. In 1977, her composition, Music of the Spheres was included on Voyager 1 and 2's Golden Record.
In April 1975, Suzanne Ciani gave two performances on her Buchla synthesizer – one at the WBAI Free music store and one at Phil Niblock's loft. These performances were released on an archival album in 2016 entitled Buchla Concerts 1975. According to the record label, these concerts were part live presentation, part grant application and part educational demonstration.
However, it was not until Brian Eno coined the term in the mid-70s that ambient music was defined as a genre. Eno went on to record 1975's Discreet Music with this in mind, suggesting that it be listened to at ""comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility"", referring to Satie's quote about his musique d'ameublement.
Other contemporaneous musicians creating ambient-style music at the time included Jamaican dub musicians such as King Tubby, Japanese electronic music composers such as Isao Tomita and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel's Environments series, and German experimental bands such as Popol Vuh, Cluster, Kraftwerk, Harmonia, Ash Ra Tempel and Tangerine Dream. Mike Orme of Stylus Magazine describes the work of Berlin school musicians as ""laying the groundwork"" for ambient.
The impact the rise of the synthesizer in modern music had on ambient as a genre cannot be overstated; as Ralf Hutter of early electronic pioneers Kraftwerk said in a 1977 Billboard interview: ""Electronics is beyond nations and colors...with electronics everything is possible. The only limit is with the composer"".  The Yellow Magic Orchestra developed a distinct style of ambient electronic music that would later be developed into ambient house music.

Brian Eno
The English producer Brian Eno is credited with coining the term ""ambient music"" in the mid-1970s. He said other artists had been creating similar music, but that ""I just gave it a name. Which is exactly what it needed ... By naming something you create a difference. You say that this is now real. Names are very important."" He used the term to describe music that is different from forms of canned music like Muzak.
In the liner notes for his 1978 album Ambient 1: Music for Airports, Eno wrote:

Whereas the extant canned music companies proceed from the basis of regularizing environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncrasies, Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. Whereas conventional background music is produced by stripping away all sense of doubt and uncertainty (and thus all genuine interest) from the music, Ambient Music retains these qualities. And whereas their intention is to ""brighten"" the environment by adding stimulus to it (thus supposedly alleviating the tedium of routine tasks and leveling out the natural ups and downs of the body rhythms) Ambient Music is intended to induce calm and a space to think. Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.
Eno, who describes himself as a ""non-musician"", termed his experiments ""treatments"" rather than traditional performances.

1980s
In the late 70s, new-age musician Laraaji began busking in New York parks and sidewalks, including Washington Square Park. It was there that Brian Eno heard Laraaji playing and asked him if he'd like to record an album. Day of Radiance released in 1980, was the third album in Eno's Ambient series. Although Laraaji had already recorded a number of albums, this one gave him international recognition. Unlike other albums in the series, Day of Radiance featured mostly acoustic instruments instead of electronics.
In the mid-1980s, the possibilities to create a sonic landscape increased through the use of sampling.  By the late 1980s, there was a steep increase in the incorporation of the computer in the writing and recording process of records. The sixteen-bit Macintosh platform with built-in sound and comparable IBM models would find themselves in studios and homes of musicians and record makers.
However, many artists were still working with analogue synthesizers and acoustic instruments to produce ambient works.
In 1983, Midori Takada recorded her first solo LP Through the Looking Glass in two days. She performed all parts on the album, with diverse instrumentation including percussion, marimba, gong, reed organ, bells, ocarina, vibraphone, piano and glass Coca-Cola bottles.
Between 1988 and 1993, Éliane Radigue produced three hour-long works on the ARP 2500 which were subsequently issued together as La Trilogie De La Mort.
Also in 1988, founding member and director of the San Francisco Tape Music Centre, Pauline Oliveros coined the term ""deep listening"" after she recorded an album inside a huge underground cistern in Washington which has a 45-second reverberation time. The concept of Deep Listening then went on to become ""an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation"".

1990s
By the early 1990s, artists such as the Orb, Aphex Twin, Seefeel, the Irresistible Force, Biosphere, and the Higher Intelligence Agency gained commercial success and were being referred to by the popular music press as ambient house, ambient techno, IDM or simply ""ambient"". The term chillout emerged from British ecstasy culture which was originally applied in relaxed downtempo ""chillout rooms"" outside of the main dance floor where ambient, dub and downtempo beats were played to ease the tripping mind.
British artists such as Aphex Twin (specifically: Selected Ambient Works Volume II, 1994), Global Communication (76:14, 1994), The Future Sound of London (Lifeforms, 1994, ISDN, 1994), the Black Dog (Temple of Transparent Balls, 1993), Autechre (Incunabula, 1993, Amber, 1994), Boards of Canada, and The KLF's Chill Out, (1990), all took a part in popularising and diversifying ambient music where it was used as a calming respite from the intensity of the hardcore and techno popular at that time.
Other global ambient artists from the 1990s include American composers Stars of the Lid (who released 5 albums during this decade), and Japanese artist Susumu Yokota whose album Sakura (1999) featured what Pitchfork magazine called ""dreamy, processed guitar as a distinctive sound tool"".

2000s–present
By the late 2000s to present, ambient music also gained widespread recognition on YouTube, with uploaded pieces, usually ranging from one to eight hours long, getting over millions of hits. Such videos are usually titled, or are generally known as, ""relaxing music"", and may be influenced by other music genres. Ambient videos assist online listeners with yoga, study, sleep (see music and sleep), massage, meditation and gaining optimism, inspiration, and creating peaceful atmosphere in their rooms or other environments.
Many uploaded ambient videos tend to be influenced by biomusic where they feature sounds of nature, though the sounds would be modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the sounds as part of the ambience. Such natural sounds oftentimes include those of a beach, rainforest, thunderstorm and rainfall, among others, with vocalizations of animals such as bird songs being used as well. Pieces containing binaural beats are common and popular uploads as well, which provide music therapy and stress management for the listener.
iTunes and Spotify have digital radio stations that feature ambient music, which are mostly produced by independent labels.
Acclaimed ambient music of this era (according to Pitchfork magazine) include works by Max Richter, Julianna Barwick, Grouper, William Basinski, Oneohtrix Point Never, and the Caretaker. In 2011, American composer Liz Harris recording as Grouper released the album AIA: Alien Observer, listed by Pitchfork at number 21 on their ""50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time"". In 2011, Julianna Barwick released her first full-length album The Magic Place. Heavily influenced by her childhood experiences in a church choir, Barwick loops her wordless vocals into ethereal soundscapes. It was listed at number 30 on Pitchfork's 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time. After several self-released albums, Buchla composer, producer and performer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith was signed to independent record label Western Vinyl in 2015. In 2016, she released her second official album EARS. It paired the Buchla synthesizer with traditional instruments and her compositions were compared to Laurie Spiegel and Alice Coltrane. Kaitlyn has also collaborated with other well-known Buchla performer, Suzanne Ciani. Iggy Pop's 2019 album Free features ambient soundscapes. Mallsoft, a subgenre of vaporwave, features various ambient influences, with artists such as Cat System Corp. and Groceries exploring ambient sounds typical of malls and grocery stores.

Related and derivative genres
Ambient dub
Ambient dub is a fusion of ambient music with dub. The term was first coined by Birmingham's now defunct label ""Beyond Records"" in early 1990s. The label released series of albums Ambient Dub Volume 1 to 4 that inspired many artists, including Bill Laswell, who used the same phrase in his music project Divination, where he collaborated with other artists in the genre. Ambient dub adopts dub styles made famous by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists from the 1960s to the early 1970s, using DJ-inspired ambient electronica, complete with all the inherent drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It often features layering techniques and incorporates elements of world music, deep bass lines and harmonic sounds. According to David Toop, ""Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation."" Notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, the Orb, Gaudi, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground as well as Banco de Gaia and Leyland Kirby

Ambient house
Ambient house is a musical category founded in the late 1980s that is used to describe acid house featuring ambient music elements and atmospheres. Tracks in the ambient house genre typically feature four-on-the-floor beats, synth pads, and vocal samples integrated in an atmospheric style. Ambient house tracks generally lack a diatonic center and feature much atonality along with synthesized chords. The Dutch Brainvoyager is an example of this genre. Illbient is another form of ambient house music.

Ambient techno
Ambient techno is a music category emerging in the late 1980s that is used to describe ambient music atmospheres with the rhythmic and melodic elements of techno. Notable artists include Aphex Twin, B12, Autechre, and the Black Dog.

Ambient industrial
Ambient industrial is a hybrid genre of industrial and ambient music. A ""typical"" ambient industrial work (if there is such a thing) might consist of evolving dissonant harmonies of metallic drones and resonances, extreme low frequency rumbles and machine noises, perhaps supplemented by gongs, percussive rhythms, bullroarers, distorted voices or anything else the artist might care to sample (often processed to the point where the original sample is no longer recognizable). Entire works may be based on radio telescope recordings, the babbling of newborn babies, or sounds recorded through contact microphones on telegraph wires.

Ambient pop
Ambient pop is a style that developed in the 1980s and 1990s contemporaneously with post-rock; it has also been regarded as an extension of the dream pop movement and the atmospheric style of shoegaze. It incorporates structures that are common to rock and pop music while exploring ""electronic textures and atmospheres that mirror the hypnotic, meditative qualities of ambient music"", which is also central to indie electronic music. Ambient pop utilizes the musical experimentation of psychedelia and the repetitive traits of minimalism, krautrock and techno as prevalent influences. Despite being an extension of dream pop, it is distinguished by its adoption of ""contemporary electronic idioms, including sampling, although for the most part live instruments continue to define the sound.""
David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy with ambient music pioneer Brian Eno, both of whom were inspired during the production of the albums in the trilogy by German kosmische Musik bands and minimalist composers, was regarded as influential on ambient pop. The track ""Red Sails"" from the trilogy's third album, Lodger (1979), has been retroactively described as a ""piece of ambient pop"", prominently incorporating a motorik drum rhythm. English art rock band Japan's song ""Taking Islands in Africa"" from Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) was described by AllMusic critic Stewart Mason as a forecast of ""the ambient pop direction Japan (and leader David Sylvian) would take for the rest of their careers"".
Dream pop band Slowdive's 1995 album Pygmalion heavily incorporated elements of ambient electronica and psychedelia, influencing many ambient pop bands and subsequently being regarded as a landmark album in the genre; Pitchfork critic Nitsuh Abebe described the album's songs as ""ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock [bands] like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride"". The genre continued to stylistically progress in the 2000s with bands including Broadcast, Múm, Dntel and the Postal Service.

Dark ambient
Brian Eno's original vision of ambient music as unobtrusive musical wallpaper, later fused with warm house rhythms and given playful qualities by the Orb in the 1990s, found its opposite in the style known as dark ambient. Populated by a wide assortment of personalities—ranging from older industrial and metal experimentalists (Scorn's Mick Harris, Current 93's David Tibet, Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton) to electronic boffins (Kim Cascone/PGR, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia), Japanese noise artists (K.K. Null, Merzbow), and latter-day indie rockers (Main, Bark Psychosis) – dark ambient features toned-down or entirely missing beats with unsettling passages of keyboards, eerie samples, and treated guitar effects. Like most styles related in some way to electronic/dance music of the '90s, it's a very nebulous term; many artists enter or leave the style with each successive release. Related styles include ambient industrial (see below) and isolationist ambient.

Space music
Space music, also spelled ""Spacemusic"", includes music from the ambient genre as well as a broad range of other genres with certain characteristics in common to create the experience of contemplative spaciousness.
Space music ranges from simple to complex sonic textures sometimes lacking conventional melodic, rhythmic, or vocal components, generally evoking a sense of ""continuum of spatial imagery and emotion"", beneficial introspection, deep listening and sensations of floating, cruising or flying.
Space music is used by individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to stimulate relaxation, contemplation, inspiration and generally peaceful expansive moods and soundscapes. Space music is also a component of many film soundtracks and is commonly used in planetariums, as a relaxation aid and for meditation.

Film soundtracks
Examples of films with soundtracks that feature some, or extensive, usage of ambient music include, Forbidden Planet (1956), THX 1138 (1971), Solaris (1972), Blade Runner (1982), The Thing (1982), Dune (1984),, Heathers (1988), Akira (1988), Ghost in the Shell (1995),  Titanic (1997), Traffic (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), Solaris (2002), The Passion of the Christ (2004), Pride & Prejudice (2005), Moon (2009), The Social Network (2010), Cosmopolis (2012), Her (2013), Enemy (2013), Drive (2011),  Interstellar (2014), Gone Girl (2014), The Revenant (2015), Columbus (2017), Mandy (2018), Annihilation (2018), Ad Astra (2019), Chernobyl (2019) and Dune (2021), among many others.

Amon Tobin,"Amon Adonai Santos de Araújo Tobin (born February 7, 1972), known as Amon Tobin (), is a Brazilian electronic musician, composer and producer. He is noted for his unusual methodology in sound design and music production. He has released eight major studio albums under the London-based Ninja Tune record label. He has also released two albums under the alias Two Fingers with collaborator Doubleclick. His latest release, Nomark Selects V.1, was released on April 28, 2023.
His music has been used in numerous major motion pictures including The Italian Job and 21. Tobin has created songs for several independent films, including the 2006 Hungarian film Taxidermia, and had his music used in other independent films, including the 2002 Cannes Palme d'Or–nominated Divine Intervention. A selection of his tracks were featured in commercial bumps on Toonami and in the 2005 anime IGPX, and he produced the musical scores to critically acclaimed video games Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory by Ubisoft in 2005, and Sucker Punch's Infamous in 2009.

Biography
Early career (1995–1997)
Tobin was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tobin's father is Irish. At the age of 2, he and his family left Brazil to live in Morocco, the Netherlands, London, Portugal and Madeira. Tobin settled in Brighton, England as a teenager which remained his permanent residence until 2002. There he began producing electronic music in his bedroom with samplers and other audio equipment including an Amstrad Studio 100 4-track,: 00:14:05  although he was ""not really involved in the [music] scene"" at that time.: 00:07:20  While taking an editorial photography class at a university in Brighton, he responded to a magazine promotion for the London-based Ninebar record label asking artists to send in demos of their songs. Ninebar signed Tobin to the label in 1996 after hearing his early work, and he traveled between his home in Brighton and the studios in London to produce his first official works.
Under his original moniker Cujo (in Portuguese, the word for whose), he released a series of original compositions on 12-inch vinyl.: 00:05:40  AllMusic called them ""head-turning"" in a review. Many of those tracks were later included on his first full-length album Adventures in Foam, originally released in 1996 by Ninebar to a limited release of 5,000 copies.: 00:07:50 
The larger Ninja Tune record label had been growing in the United Kingdom at the time with help from artists DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, and Coldcut. DJ Food and Funki Porcini noticed Tobin's work on Adventures in Foam and prompted the label to approach him. Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996, this time under his abbreviated name ""Amon Tobin"". The official Ninja Tune website has said that Adventures in Foam had been re-released without permission by the US-based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version, labeled the ""US release"", included only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that some tracks were titled incorrectly. In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re-released the album themselves. This version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing previously unreleased material. As of 2008, copies of Shadow Record's ""US version"" are sold by online retailer Amazon.com. Over the course of its production, Adventures in Foam has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style ""got totally out of hand"", but that it ""never fails to let the listener know who's in charge."" The album was released for a fourth time in 2002, again by Ninja Tune.

Bricolage, Permutation and Supermodified (1997–2002)
Over the next several years, Tobin released three albums. Bricolage, released in 1997, was the culmination of two projects Tobin had started after his debut album earlier that year. His third album Permutation was released in 1998. In the late 1990s, sample-based music was becoming more popular with a wide range of emerging and developing genres, but Tobin himself was still largely unknown. Tobin's style of music was not seen as definitively belonging to one genre or another.: 00:18:40  The critics that commented on Bricolage and Permutation gave them positive reviews and they are often mentioned, by later reviewers and interviewers, as classic albums of the time. Pitchfork acclaimed the use of jazz instrument samples, comparing him to famous composers Quincy Jones and Miles Davis. In a 1999 review, they awarded Bricolage a very rare 10/10 and said that it was ""one of the most inventive records of the decade.""
Tobin released his fourth album, Supermodified in 2000. The album is regarded as his most commercial album to date.: 00:31:00  Critic reviews were generally positive, with Pitchfork rating the album 9.1/10, and Stylus Magazine saying, ""Not many studio-bound electronic musicians could put forward such a vivid and dynamic statement or make it as entertaining and downright funky as Supermodified has managed to do.""

Out From Out Where, Chaos Theory and Foley Room (2002–2008)
In 2002, Tobin relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada where he had spent time previously at Ninja Tune's North American Headquarters. Tobin lived in the industrial area of Old Montreal to avoid noise complaints from neighbors after dark. There he produced his fifth album Out From Out Where released that same year. This was his first album created primarily in a professional studio.: 00:31:19  He later released a single, Verbal, taken from Out From Out Where. Otis Hart of Dusted Magazine said that Tobin's style of producing had come into its own. He acclaimed Tobin's ""refined sense of tempo"".
In January 2004, Tobin was contracted by video game company Ubisoft Montreal to compose the soundtrack for the third installment of their critically successful Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. To facilitate using the music in a video game, where the level of action or plot can change in real-time, each track was broken down by Tobin into four distinct but similar parts based on their level of intensity. The game's developers could then use each section to provide music based on the actions of the player. Despite not being an official album in Tobin's discography, it was considered a ground breaking work in the world of video game sound tracks described as ""an entirely new era of media"" by Tiny Mix Tapes.
The album continued the trend Tobin started with Out From Out Where, as he used more field recordings during production. In addition to being included with the game, Ninja Tune released the score as an individual album in 2005, titled Chaos Theory – Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack, several months before the game's release. It was received well, benefiting from a wider audience of reviewers in both the music and gaming industries. Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH.com applauded Tobin's use of melody and texture, adding that he controlled the sounds with the ""clarity of a classical orchestrator."" He later recorded a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound version of the album with audio engineer Bobby Azinsky in a dedicated Solid State Logic studio in Los Angeles.
Tobin's sixth studio album, Foley Room, was released in 2007. The title alludes to the ""Foley rooms"" used by recording engineers and Foley artists to record sound effects in the movie industry. On this album, Tobin concluded his transition away from prerecorded source material that started with Out From Out Where. All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an omnidirectional microphone. Recorded primarily in Montreal, San Francisco, and Seattle, the samples came from a wide range of sources including motorbikes, tigers, insects, and water falling from a tap. Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet, drummer Stefan Schneider, and harpist Sarah Pagé. Foley Room's use of field-recordings was used to help promote the album, including two official pre-release trailers posted to YouTube. Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a ""smooth, natural progression"" from his work on Supermodified. The first single, ""Bloodstone"", was released to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album. Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled Foley Room: Found Footage which documented the recording process.

ISAM and Two Fingers (2009–2018)
In 2006, Tobin began collaborating on a hip-hop oriented project with British drum-and-bass producer Doubleclick and a number of guest vocalists. As Two Fingers, the pair have released several singles, followed by their self-titled debut album in 2009. The eponymous release came out in 2009 on Paper Bag Records in North America and Big Dada in the United Kingdom. The two producers, who first met when Tobin was living in Brighton, U.K., got together in Montreal in 2007 over a series of tracks that were partially an extension of their previous collaborations — exemplified by the dense, pummeling 2003 track ""Ownage"" — but in general, a fundamentally new and dynamic direction incorporating visceral elements of dancehall, dubstep, and grime. Following the singles ""That Girl"" and ""What You Know,"" the group's self-titled debut was released in spring 2009, featuring vocals from dancehall star Ce'Cile, Ms. Jade, and, on seven of the album's 12 tracks, British rapper Sway. In 2009, Tobin also collaborated with the UK drum-and-bass artist Dom & Roland on a track titled “Sylo” for the album No Strings Attached.
In 2008, Tobin announced he was working on a new video game soundtrack for an ""undisclosed PS3 title"". This was later revealed to be the PlayStation 3 exclusive game, inFamous, and in 2010, Tobin announced that he would be working on the music for Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction. Recent works include ""Hey Mr. Tree"" as a 'Bonus Joint' to accompany his earlier 'Monthly Joint' collection, a remix of Noisia's ""Machine Gun"" released alongside remixes by 16 Bit and Spor, and a collaboration with ESKMO dubbed Eskamon. Eskamon has released a single ""Fine Objects"".
In January 2011, his artist page was updated on Ninja Tune website, announcing a new album entitled ISAM, as well as a Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory remix album. After being leaked by a journalist, ISAM was released on April 20, 2011. As its extension, in May 2012, Tobin released the Boxset, prominent of its form of a mechanical press. As a set of 15 different physical carriers, it contains remixes, cover versions and re-interpretations of tracks from ISAM, along with Tobin's earliest audio experiments, film and television scores, as well as deleted bootlegs.
The second album under Two Fingers, Stunt Rhythms, was a solo effort by Amon Tobin and was designed by Inventory Studio and released worldwide by Big Dada Recordings in 2012.
On April 18, 2015, Amon Tobin announced Dark Jovian, an EP, and his first release under his name in four years.

Nomark Records and new aliases (2019–present)
In February 2019, Amon Tobin's website announced a new album, Fear in a Handful of Dust, to be released in April 2019 on a new label, Nomark Records. The album's release on April 26, 2019, marked the end of a 8 year long hiatus in new studio LP album releases under Tobin's name (his previous release being ISAM in 2011). Throughout the remainder of 2019, Tobin would also release three singles under his Two Fingers alias: You Ain't Down, 296 Rhythm, and LED Moon Rhythm. On July 26, 2019, Tobin released the album Time to Run under a new alias known as Only Child Tyrant.
In September 2019, Tobin announced the Nomark Club, an annual subscription service that grants access to all of Tobin's material as it is released, including some member-exclusive content (the material is delivered via Bandcamp's subscription service). A supporter-exclusive extended play album titled Fine Strips of Violence was released in tandem with the announcement. Long Stories, which arrived October 2019, was made in parallel with Fear in a Handful of Dust and features prominent use of a broken Omnichord. In December 2019, Tobin released a two-track Nomark Club-exclusive album titled Nine Bars Back under the alias of Cujo—one that had not been used since the release of Adventures in Foam in 1996.
Tobin released The World As We Know It in July 2020 under the alias Figueroa, which marked a departure in Tobin's usual instrumental style, as it was his first major release to feature prominent vocal work. The album's lyrics were performed by Tobin himself with technical guidance from producer Sylvia Massy. Tobin describes the lyrics as being rather ambiguous, stating in an interview that ""I want the feeling of the songs to be the priority, rather than the specific meaning."" West Coast Love Stories, the debut album by new alias Stone Giants, ""celebrates the relationship between voice and machine from an altogether different perspective - humans and electronics pooling resources to explore themes of love and being none the wiser for it.""
The ""cinematic and apocalyptic"" How Do You Live, released under Tobin's name, arrived in September 2021. In February 2021, Tobin was announced to be involved in the soundtracking of the Meow Wolf Omega Mart installation, along with Beach House, Brian Eno, Santigold, and others. Tobin's soundtrack to the installation, A Living Room (Music from Meow Wolf's Omega Mart) was released on September 23, 2022, on his Nomark Records label as a single-sided vinyl record with an etching on the reverse. As Two Fingers, a trio of collaborative singles with the German producer Muadeep came out in 2022: Blood Moon, Banished, and Lost Gods, leading to the trio's album Cronos. Also in 2022, the Only Child Tyrant alias released a pair of singles: HoneyCup Troll and Make Better Friends. In 2023, the Nomark Records label released the Nomark Selects V.1 compilation album, an album that contained singles hand-picked by the Nomark Club members.

Musical style and influences
Tobin is best known for his use of audio manipulation techniques, where any given source material is transformed to produce a new sound.: 00:29:10  His use of this technique has changed over the course of his career. On his original singles under Ninebar and his first three albums, Tobin acquired all of the sound sources to produce music from his personal collection of vinyl records. He manipulates the sounds with a combination of audio hardware and software including Cubase,: 00:33:40  often leaving the original source unrecognizable in its new context. The majority of his early work focused on reordering the break beats from jazz and blues music into faster more complex patterns.: 00:31:19 : 00:01:31  Guido Farnell of InTheMix.com, wrote about his use of this technique, saying that Tobin has ""taken the art to new and dizzying heights.""
His fifth album Out From Out Where began the gradual shift away from prerecorded material by incorporating original guitar samples. His techniques began branching into technical sound design, taking break beats or single instruments, modifying specific frequencies, and producing new sounds.: 00:41:35  This trend continued through his video game score Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Soundtrack, and by his sixth album, Foley Room, all of the source material was recorded in the field by himself. Speaking about the creativity of sample-based music compared to traditional instruments, he says that ""creative input is not determined by your source material but in how you edit and manipulate the sounds.""
Tobin experimented with various instruments. He does not come from a music family, nor has he had any formal training in music theory.: 00:12:30  About his music in general, Tobin says that he sees it as a ""genuine"" expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were ""genuine"" expressions of the 1960s.: 00:25:10 
Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.

Live performances
Tobin began performing live shows in clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage. His shows generally contained music that he had produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin was not interested in adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.
In 2011, Tobin developed a live show in support of the album ISAM, fitting his criteria for a performance that is both live and purely electronic. He told Wired Magazine ""The idea was to integrate myself, quite literally, into an audio and visual presentation of the album,"". It incorporates the use of new video mapping techniques that are projected onto a large cubic structure from which Tobin performs. The show has been met with international acclaim described by Vice Magazine's Creators Project as ""revolutionizing the live music experience"".
Tobin has performed individual shows in many countries including tours in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the United States. His 2003 live performance in Melbourne, Australia was used for the fourth album in Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series because Tobin was not available to record a studio mix at the time. Many songs from the original recording were omitted because of copyright issues with the original artists, including the R&B group Destiny's Child.
A second Solid Steel album Foley Room Recorded Live in Brussels was recorded in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007, and was released for free in November 2008. According to Tobin's official website, ""After months of back and forth and despite everyone's best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers. Rather than release a compromised version commercially, the decision was made to give it away for free instead.""

Film work and soundtracks
Amon Tobin's sounds and samples are frequently used in the British car-based TV show Top Gear, and his song ""Four Ton Mantis"" has been used in advertisements for Nissan Qashqai and Juke. Tobin's music also appeared in several major motion pictures including The Italian Job, Tideline (Littoral) and 21. He has also produced tracks for a number of independent films, including The Last Minute, and has created production music for the BMG Zomba commercial library which is used in various films. In 2006, he scored the soundtrack for the Hungarian horror film Taxidermia which was made available on his website. He also produced the score for the 2009 documentary Pax Americana and the Weaponization of Space.
In April 2010, Tobin composed and produced a small body of work for the video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction which was available for streaming on his website. In 2013, Two Fingers composed the theme music for the BBC America/Space original series Orphan Black.

Discography
Tobin has released seventeen major studio albums under his name as well as various aliases:

In addition, his body of work includes a variety of extended plays containing several B-sides each, a live album for the Solid Steel series, new material for various compilation albums, and original tracks available as free downloads on his website.

The Future Sound of London,"The Future Sound of London (often abbreviated FSOL) is a British electronic music duo composed of Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans. They have been described as a ""boundary-pushing"" electronic act, covering techno, ambient, house music, trip hop, psychedelia, and dub.
While keeping an enigmatic image and releasing music under many aliases, the band found commercial success with singles ""Papua New Guinea"" (1991) and ""Cascade"" (1993), and albums Lifeforms (1994), ISDN (1995) and Dead Cities (1996). In recent years, the duo has become more candid with their fanbase online. Their later work include their series of experimental Environments and Archives albums.

History
Formation
Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans met in the mid-1980s while studying electronics at university in Manchester. Dougans had already been making electronic music, working between Glasgow and Manchester, when the pair first began working together in local clubs. In 1988, Dougans embarked on a project for a graphic studio Stakker, which resulted with a single ""Stakker Humanoid"" that reached number 17 in the UK charts, introducing acid house to mainstream audience. Cobain contributed to the accompanying album Global. In the following years the pair produced music under a variety of aliases, releasing a number of singles and EPs, including ""Q"" and ""Metropolis"", later featured on the 1992 compilation Earthbeat. They were initially signed to the British sub-label of Passion Music, Jumpin' & Pumpin'.
In 1991, Cobain and Dougans released their breakthrough single, ""Papua New Guinea"" on Jumpin' & Pumpin'. The song was based upon a sample from ""Dawn of the Iconoclast"" by Dead Can Dance and a bassline from ""Radio Babylon"" by Meat Beat Manifesto. It enjoyed great success, charting at #22 for seven weeks in 1992. The single was followed by their debut album, Accelerator, which included ""Papua New Guinea"" among other new tracks. After a few other releases on Jumpin' & Pumpin', they were signed by Virgin Records, with the free reign to experiment.
In 1993, the duo released an ambient album Tales of Ephidrina, the first under the alias Amorphous Androgynous. The focus on texture and mood, while retaining dance beats, was well received. The album was released on Quigley, the band's own short-lived offshoot of Virgin. The band begun experimenting with radio performance, broadcasting three-hour radio shows to Manchester's Kiss FM from their studio.

Lifeforms and the ISDN tour
In 1993, the band released ""Cascade,"" a nearly 40 minutes single which made the UK top 30. It was followed in 1994 by the album Lifeforms, released to critical acclaim and a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. The eponymous single featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The record introduced an array of exotic, tropical sound samples. Dougans' father's involvement in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop had a heavy influence on Lifeforms. Often asked whether Brian Eno was an influence, Cobain and Dougans said they were about looking to the future not the past. To them, Lifeforms was a new work not just another Eno-type ambient album.
That year, the Future Sound of London released a limited-edition album ISDN, which featured live broadcasts made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote Lifeforms, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York, and several appearances on BBC Sessions hosted by John Peel. The shows featured ambient soundscapes with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One performance for BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp. The tone of ISDN was darker and more rhythmic than Lifeforms. The band wanted to achieve something epic and grand, but no matter how much technological or personal support they had they never got to truly do what they envisioned. Cobain said that the 90s were a time of frustration because the technology didn't fit the band's ideas. In 1995, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list.
The band's interests have covered different areas including film and video, 2D and 3D computer graphics, animation in making almost all their own videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating electronic devices for sound making.

Dead Cities
The 1995 edition of John Peel Sessions featured new tracks which moved away from breakbeat and the free sampling of ISDN. In 1996, the band released Dead Cities which expanded upon these early demos, in a mix of ambient textures and dance music. The new sound was introduced in the lead single ""My Kingdom."" The album featured the first collaboration with composer Max Richter, including on a 1997 big beat single ""We Have Explosive"" that featured manipulated samples of Run DMC. The track was used on popular soundtracks to Mortal Kombat Annihilation, and the video game WipE'out"" 2097, the latter also including a new track ""Landmass."" ""We Have Explosive"" was the band's highest-charting single, and over the course of its five-part extended version included hints of funk.
The album was promoted by what the band described as ""the fuck rock'n'roll tour"" via ISDN, gaining attention as the first world tour without leaving a studio. While the 1994 tour focused on creating soundscapes and unreleased material, the 1996 and 1997 shows were more conventional, each offering a different take on music featured on Dead Cities, blending current with occasional unreleased tracks. The final performances included considerable use of live guitar and percussion. These sessions were the basis of the band's later psychedelic projects of the following decade, while others appeared on the subsequent album series From The Archives.

New millennium
After a four-year hiatus, rumours of mental illness began to spread. In an interview, Cobain revealed that he had been undertaking spiritual experimentation and had dealt with a bout of mercury poisoning, with over one hundred times the amount deemed to be safe. He gained much from his experience, realising that he could use music as a tool for psychic exploration, entertainment, and healing.  The pair returned in 2002 with ""The Isness"", a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by Papua New Guinea Translations, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from The Isness sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with Muzik magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it ""...a white beam of light from heaven..."" and other British publications such as The Times, The Guardian and MOJO praising the album and the band's ability to do something so completely different from what they had done before.
Three years on, they followed the album with a continuation of the Amorphous Androgynous project, Alice in Ultraland. Rumoured to be accompanied by a film of the same title, the album took The Isness' psychedelic experimentation and toned it down, giving the album a singular theme and sound, and replacing the more bizarre moments with funk and ambient interludes. The album was ignored by the press, but was received more favourably among fans than its predecessor. Unlike The Isness, which featured almost 100 musicians over the course of it and the various alternative versions and remix albums, Alice in Ultraland featured a fairly solid band lineup throughout, which extended to live shows which the band had undertaken away from the ISDN cables from 2005 onwards.

...song form has just become too limited. And when I say 'psychedelic', it's not a reference to 60s music but to the basic outlook of a child, which we all have. I think this is the only salvation now. Dance music taught us how to use the studio in a new way, but we have to now take that knowledge and move on with it. This stuff, electronic music, is not dead. It's a process that is ongoing. We have to take hold of the past and go forward with it...

5.1 & digital experimentation
The FSOL moniker re-appeared in 2006 with a piece entitled ""A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static"", intended as an experiment in 5.1 Surround Sound and created for an exhibition at the Kinetica art museum entitled, appropriately, ""Life Forms"". The piece contained reworked material from their archives and newer, more abstract ambient music. The piece was coupled with a video called ""Stereo Sucks"", marking the band's theories on the limitations of stereo music, which was released on a DVD packaged with issue 182 of Future Music Magazine in December 2006 and on FSOL's own download site in March 2007.
They also moved into creating their own sounds when they began constructing electronic instruments, the result of which can be heard on the 2007 release Hand-Made Devices. At their website Glitch TV (where the motto is ""[A] sudden interruption in sanity, continuity or programme function"") they sell and explain their devices such as the ""Electronic Devices Digital Interface"" glitch equipment.

FSOLdigital and the Archives
In 2007, the band uploaded several archive tracks online, for the first time revealing much of their unreleased work and unveiling some of the mystery behind the band. The old FSOL material, including the previously unreleased album Environments, along with a selection of newer experiments, the 5.1 experiments and a promise of unreleased Amorphous Androgynous psychedelic material, was uploaded for sale on their online shop, FSOLdigital.com.

The FSOLdigital platform has performed very well – we are delighted that people still dig us – we dig you all too.
In early March 2008, the band released a new online album as Amorphous Androgynous entitled The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness, which they describe as ""A collection of psychedelic relics from The Amorphous Androgynous, 1967–2007"". The release retains the sound of their last two psychedelic albums, while expanding on the element of funk first introduced on 2005's Alice in Ultraland. They recorded their following album, The Woodlands of Old, under the alias of their imaginary engineer Yage. Unlike the techno work recorded as Yage in 1992, this new record was darker, more trip hop and world music-oriented and featured ex-Propellerheads member Will White.
From 2008, the band showcased a series of radio broadcasts and podcasts called The Electric Brain Storms, originally on stations such as Proton Radio, PBS radio in Australia, and Frisky Radio. The remaining shows appeared on the band's official site. and SoundCloud. The shows featured electronic, krautrock, experimental and psychedelic favourites of the band mixed in with known and unknown FSOL material, including newly recorded tracks, archived pieces, and new alias recordings. Many of the new tracks appeared on the band's Environments series. Cobain has described the new music as having ""the introspective, kind of euphoric sadness that was always there in the FSOL melodies"".
From this point, the band have been alternating their focus between different projects. In 2008, Environments II and From the Archives Vol. 5 were released on the band's site, followed by Environments 3 and From the Archives Vol. 6 in 2010; and Environments 4 and From the Archives Vol. 7 in 2012. Whilst the Archives feature old, unreleased material, the Environments albums feature a mixture of old demos, recently completed, and new tracks.
The band have continued to use the FSOLDigital platform to release side-projects and solo work, under names such as Blackhill Transmitter, EMS : Piano, Suburban Domestic and 6 Oscillators in Remittance, as well as distributing digital releases from other artists, including Daniel Pemberton, Herd, Kettel & Secede, Neotropic, Ross Baker and Seafar; they also continue to update The Pod Room with ISDN transmissions from the 1990s.

A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind
Following on from the band's 1997 DJ set of the same name, a series of Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind mix CDs were begun in 2006. The first two were released under the Amorphous Androgynous alias, subtitled ""Cosmic Space Music"" and ""Pagan Love Vibrations"", with the first taking over two years to compile, mix and gain sample clearance, both featuring the band's psychedelic influences. A third is set for release sometime in 2010, and will be more electronic, mixed by the Future Sound of London. Further mixes in the series are expected in the future, to be curated by related artists, and the band took the concept live with an eleven-hour spot at 2009's Green Man festival, to contain live bands and DJ spots.
Noel Gallagher of British rock band Oasis, after hearing the first release, became a fan and asked the band to remix the following Oasis single ""Falling Down"". The Amorphous Androgynous responded with a 5 part, 22-minute Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble remix, which Noel liked enough to release on its own 12"". Noel also invited Cobain to DJ at the afterparty for one of Oasis' gigs at Wembley Arena.
The band continue the psychedelic theme to the mixes on their podcast site The Pod Room and on February 2010s Mojo Magazine cover CD. The Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble remixes grow in popularity with commissions from Paul Weller and Pop Levi, and Cobain has suggested a full album of remixes and covers will appear on their recently formed Monstrous Bubble label
On 6 July 2011 it was announced that Noel Gallagher's second solo album would be in collaboration with The Amorphous Androgynous, and was set for release in 2012. In August 2012, Gallagher mentioned in various interviews that he was considering scrapping the collaborative album with Amorphous Androgynous due to not being completely satisfied with the mixes. Two songs from the project have surfaced as B-sides to Gallagher's singles in 2012: ""Shoot a Hole into the Sun"" (based on Gallagher's track ""If I Had a Gun..."") was a B-side to the single ""Dream On"", and a mix of ""AKA... What a Life!"" featured on the B-side of ""Everybody's on the Run"". However, as the project was shelved in November 2012, the group have returned to original material, releasing the first in a series of Monstrous Bubble Soundtracks, entitled The Cartel. On Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds' album Chasing Yesterday, The Amorphous Androgynous are credited as Co-producers of the tracks ""The Right Stuff"" and ""The Mexican"".

Recent work
With the freedom of working independently from a record label, the group have remained prolific, working on multiple projects at once. Since 2014, the majority have releases through FSOLDigital have been of newly recorded material, with Environment Five being the first in the series to feature all new tracks. Since then, FSOL releases have been less conventional, with Environment Six being split over three volumes, named Environment Six, Environment 6.5 and Environmental, the latter part of a triple LP release called Archived : Environmental : Views. Similarly, Environment 7 is planned as a trilogy, the first volume released for Record Store Day 2022 under the name Rituals. In a move further from traditional structures, several albums have been released under the banner FSOLDigital Presents, including yearly Calendar Albums, presented to subscribers as a track each month, and mix albums as part of the A Controlled Vista and Mind Maps series. FSOLDigital has also been used as a publishing outlet, with books exploring the artwork and history of the band, each combined with a music package; a series of A6 books entitled The Ramblings of a Madman was also produced, with the accompanying download EPs later repackaged into an album entitled Music for 3 Books. Alongside books, the band have further explored multimedia, including a series of digital artwork releases as NFTs on Foundation and a pair of synthesisers created in collaboration with Digitana, the SX-1 and the HALia, the former being manufactured as of July 2018, the latter still in pre-production. A series of re-recordings of older tracks, combined with new remixes and related material, was released between 2018 and 2021 for Record Store Day, in place of conventional reissues; the reissue series so far features My Kingdom Re-Imagined, Yage 2019, Cascade 2020 and We Have Explosive 2021.
As well as The Future Sound of London, Dougans and Cobain have also revisited older side-projects. Dougans's solo project Humanoid has been active again since 2014, releasing the albums Built by Humanoid and 7 Songs as well as a string of EPs. Meanwhile, Cobain, in collaboration with Dougans and new co-producer Enrico Berto, began work on new Amorphous Androgynous material, with a double album of versions and remixes of the track ""We Persuade Ourselves We Are Immortal"" appearing in 2020. Alongside contributors such as Paul Weller, Ray Fenwick and Brian Hopper, the release features lead vocals by Peter Hammill, who is also credited on the album cover. Further alias releases have included albums released under the Blackhill Transmitter and Synthi-A names, as well as collaborations with Ross Baker and Daniel Pemberton.

Independence
Since the millennium, FSOL took a more independent turn with their career, releasing their more psychedelic Amorphous Androgynous on an independent label, The Isness on Artful Records and Alice in Ultraland on the progressive Harvest Records (an arm of EMI). They also have their own label called Electronic Brain Violence on which off-beat electronic artists such as Oil and Simon Wells (Headstone Lane) have released EPs and singles. Simon Wells also contributed to Dead Cities on the track ""Dead Cities Reprise""
Nevertheless, Virgin records still controls FSOL's back catalog and was going to release the Teachings from the Electronic Brain compilation without them, but the duo insisted on taking control of the production of the project. Cobain says that, even with Virgin, the reason they were able to do their own thing and create the music they wanted in the 1990s was because they already had some major hits under their belts such as ""Papua New Guinea"", ""Metropolis"" and ""Stakker Humanoid"" before joining the label.

Why is it, everybody, from the fucking fish and chip shop to a magazine ends up selling itself, getting the millions and retiring. Why don't people keep going with it, why can't they change it so that it keeps being important to them. Why didn't Anita Roddick keep going with Body Shop, why did it get so alien to her that she had to sell it, why? Surely she's making so many millions she can get the right people that she loves to keep going with the ethos; there's something dangerous there.
Cobain has said that FSOL's mentality has always been about making a journey of an album rather than focusing on trying to have hit singles. He said that they had several top 40 singles (and albums) in the 90s because they had enough fans and had built up enough of a reputation to achieve these hits while still concentrating on the album rather than any potential singles during their time at Virgin.
They have been signed to Passion Records sub-label Jumpin' & Pumpin' since they started out.

Aphex Twin,"Richard David James (born 18 August 1971), known professionally as Aphex Twin, is a British  musician, composer and DJ. He is known for his idiosyncratic work in electronic styles such as techno, ambient, and jungle. Journalists from publications including Mixmag, The New York Times, NME, Fact, Clash and The Guardian have called James one of the most influential and important artists in contemporary electronic music.
James was raised in Cornwall and began DJing at free parties and clubs in the area and around the South West in the late 1980s. His debut EP Analogue Bubblebath, released in 1991 on Mighty Force Records, brought James an early following; he began to perform across the UK and continental Europe. James co-founded the independent label Rephlex Records the same year. His 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85–92, released by Belgian label Apollo, garnered wider critical and popular acclaim. James signed to Warp in 1993 and subsequently released charting albums such as ...I Care Because You Do (1995) and Richard D. James Album (1996), as well as Top 40 singles such as ""Come to Daddy"" (1997) and ""Windowlicker"" (1999); the latter two were accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham and brought James significantly wider international attention.
After releasing Drukqs in 2001 and completing his contract with Warp, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 Analord EP series under his AFX alias and a pair of 2007 releases as the Tuss. In 2014 he made available a previously unreleased 1994 LP as Caustic Window. He returned later that year with the Aphex Twin album Syro on Warp, winning the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. He has since released charting EPs including Cheetah (2016) and Collapse (2018). In 2023, he released the EP Blackbox Life Recorder 21f / In a Room7 F760. ""Blackbox Life Recorder 21f"" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.

Early life
James was born on 18 August 1971 in Limerick, Ireland, to Welsh parents. He has said that he had a stillborn older brother also named Richard whose name he inherited. In a 1997 interview James stated that this death occurred while his family had moved to Canada in 1968 for his father's mining work; it led his mother to reuse the name because ""she didn't want to accept the death of the child."" James grew up in Cornwall, where he lived in Lanner while attending Redruth School in Redruth. James said he liked growing up there, ""cut off from the city and the rest of the world"". He became interested in making sounds before writing music, and as a child he played with the strings inside his family piano and disassembled tape equipment. In a 2001 interview James said that at age 11 he won £50 in a competition for producing sound on a Sinclair ZX81, a home computer with no sound hardware: ""I played around with machine code and found some codes that retuned the TV signal so that it made this really weird noise when you turned the volume up."" However, Fact Magazine reported in 2017 that this contest story is dubious, and likely based on a program published in Your Computer Magazine 1982, for which the author (G. N. Owen) was paid £6. James states that he bought his first synthesizer at age 12 and after taking an interest in electronics would modify analogue synthesisers ""and junk"" to make noise.
James began making music aged 14, partially as a refuge from the ""bloody awful"" Jesus and Mary Chain albums played by his sister. Cornwall had few record shops, but a thriving nightlife in which acid house was popular. James claimed to have been making music with similarities to acid and techno for years before hearing the genres, leading him to purchase every record he could find in the styles. In his late teens, James began DJing at clubs and raves, and included his own tracks in his sets. He studied at Cornwall College from 1988 to 1990 and graduated with a National Diploma in engineering. According to one lecturer, he often wore headphones during practical lessons and had a ""kind of mystique about him ... I think some of the other students were a bit in awe of him.""

Career
1988–1991: Cornish free parties, Rephlex Records and first releases
In the late 1980s, James became involved in the Cornish free party scene, putting on raves at ""secret coves along the coast and behind sand dunes"". The first party he DJed at was in a barn in 1988. Parties were also known to take place at Gwennap Pit. They mainly attracted local youths and travellers, with entrance donations taken in cannabis. The tight-knit community would also put on nights at small clubs in towns around the county, including St. Ives, Porthtowan, and St Austell. James would later refer to this scene as the ""best he's ever been involved in"".
James started a regular DJ slot in 1989, playing alternate weeks at the Bowgie nightclub in Crantock. There he met Tom Middleton and Grant Wilson-Claridge. Impressed by James's music, Middleton played a tape James had given him to a free party organiser in Exeter, Mark Darby, who eventually convinced James to release a record on his fledgling record label Mighty Force Records. James was initially resistant, but while he was tripping on acid backstage at a DJ gig, Darby and Middleton convinced him to release the record. Darby later said: ""I think if he had not done that trip that night there may have never been any Aphex Twin."" James has given a similar account: ""...they made me sign the contract when I was off my face. I was tripping and they're waving this money and a pen at me. It's a bit clichéd but it's the way they got me to sign."" Similarly impressed by James's music, Wilson-Claridge suggested they use some money he inherited to create a record label to release it. He and James founded Rephlex Records in 1991.
James's first release was the 12"" EP Analogue Bubblebath, released on Mighty Force in September 1991. The EP made the playlist of Kiss FM, an influential London radio station, giving it wide exposure in the dance music scene. In 2015 The Guardian called the release one of the key moments in the history of dance music. The record caught the ear of Renaat Vandepapeliere, the head of R&S Records, at that time one of the leading European rave labels. James visited him in Belgium, bringing a box full of cassettes of his music. From these cassettes they picked out tracks for two records, including James's first album Selected Ambient Works 85-92.
In 1992, as word of his 12"" records spread, James started performing at London techno events like the formative club Knowledge, held at the SW1 nightclub in London's Victoria, and the influential night Lost.
Through 1991 and 1992 James released three Analogue Bubblebath EPs, two EPs as Caustic Window, the Red EP as part of the Universal Indicator collective, along with the Digeridoo and Xylem Tube EPs on the R&S label. Although he moved to London to take an electronics course at Kingston Polytechnic, he admitted to David Toop that his electronics studies were slipping away as he pursued a career in electronic music.

1992–1994: Selected Ambient Works and early success
The first full-length Aphex Twin album, Selected Ambient Works 85–92, comprised material dating back to James's teen years. It was released in November 1992 by Apollo Records, a subsidiary of Belgian label R&S. John Bush of Allmusic would later describe the release as a watershed moment in ambient music. In a 2002 Rolling Stone record review Pat Blashill noted that Aphex Twin had ""expanded way beyond the ambient music of Brian Eno by fusing lush soundscapes with oceanic beats and bass lines,"" demonstrating that ""techno could be more than druggy dance music"". Writing for Pitchfork in 2002, David Pecoraro called it ""among the most interesting music ever created with a keyboard and a computer"". DJ Mag's Ben Murphy named it ""a seminal record in the IDM, ambient and experimental canon"".
In 1992 James also released the EPs Digeridoo and Xylem Tube EP as Aphex Twin, the Pac-Man EP (an album of remixes of Pac-Man music) as Power-Pill, two of his four Joyrex EPs (Joyrex J4 EP and Joyrex J5 EP) as Caustic Window, and Analogue Bubblebath 3. ""Digeridoo"" reached #55 on the UK Singles Chart, and was later described by Rolling Stone as foreshadowing drum and bass. That year, he also appeared as the Dice Man on the Warp Records compilation Artificial Intelligence with the track ""Polygon Window;"" the compilation would help birth the genre later known as ""intelligent dance music"" and help launch the career of Aphex Twin alongside Autechre and Richie Hawtin. In 1993 he put out his first releases on Warp: Surfing on Sine Waves (the second entry in the label's Artificial Intelligence series) and the EP Quoth, as Polygon Window. Later in the year he released the ""On"" EP, which entered the top 40 on the UK charts. Rephlex also put out an EP by James under the alias Bradley Strider, Bradley's Robot, and two more Caustic Window records.
James was part of several tours in 1993. He supported the Orb on several dates, and joined the ""Midi Circus"" tour at venues across the UK, co-headlining with Orbital, the Orb and Drum Club. Later in the year, he was part of the NASA ""See the Light"" tour with Orbital, Moby, and Vapourspace at venues across the United States.
Warp released the second Aphex Twin album, Selected Ambient Works Volume II, in March 1994. It explored a more ambient sound, inspired by lucid dreams and James's experience of synaesthesia. It reached number 11 in the UK charts, but was not particularly well received critically; critic Simon Reynolds later noted that ""many in the Aphex cult were thrown for a loop"" and that ""Aphex aficionados remain divided"". Other 1994 releases were a fourth Analogue Bubblebath, GAK (derived from early demos sent to Warp), and Classics, a compilation album.

1995–2000: ...I Care Because You Do, Richard D. James Album and Come to Daddy
For his charting 1995 album ...I Care Because You Do, composed between 1990 and 1994 in a range of styles, James used an image of his face for the cover, which became a motif on his later releases. He commissioned Western classical-music composer Philip Glass to create an orchestral version of the ...I Care Because You Do track ""Icct Hedral"", which appeared on the Donkey Rhubarb EP. In the same year, James released his Hangable Auto Bulb EP under the name AFX, which spearheaded the short-lived drill 'n' bass style.
Richard D. James Album, James's fourth studio album as Aphex Twin, was released on Warp in 1996. It features software synthesisers and unconventional rhythms. Will Hermes of Spin discussed James's use of jungle elements, writing that ""by applying junglist strategies to his own obsessive sound creation - his gorgeous weirdo palette of modernist strings, whirring crib toys, and agitated machines - he remakes drum'n'bass in his own image"". In a Pitchfork list of the best albums of the 1990s, Eric Carr wrote that Richard D. James Album demonstrated ""aggressive combinations of disparate electronic forms"", with an ""almost-brutal contrast between its elements"" that has ensured its relevance. In 2003 NME named it the 55th greatest album of all time, and in 2009 Pitchfork named it the 40th greatest album of the 1990s.
James garnered attention the following year after the release of his charting Come to Daddy EP. The title track was conceived as a death metal parody. Accompanied with a successful music video directed by Chris Cunningham, James became disenchanted by its success: ""This little idea that I had, which was a joke, turned into something huge. It wasn't right at all."" It was followed by ""Windowlicker"", a charting single promoted with another Cunningham music video, nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Video in 2000.

2001–2009: Drukqs, Analord and the Tuss
In 2001 Aphex Twin released Drukqs, an experimental double album featuring abrasive, meticulous programming and computer-controlled piano influenced by Erik Satie and John Cage. It features the piano composition ""Avril 14th"", which remains perhaps James's best known work. The album polarised reviewers. James told interviewers he had accidentally left an MP3 player with new tracks on a plane, and had rushed the album release to preempt an internet leak.
In 2001 James also released a short EP, 2 Remixes By AFX, with remixes of songs by 808 State and DJ Pierre. It also had an untitled third track, consisting of a SSTV image with high-pitched sounds which can be decoded to a viewable image with appropriate software. In 2002 James was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male. In 2003 Warp released 26 Mixes for Cash, collecting many of James's remixes for other artists.
In 2005 James released a series of vinyl EPs under the AFX name, Analord, created entirely with analogue equipment. These were followed in 2006 by a compilation album of Analord tracks, Chosen Lords. In 2007 James released two records on Rephlex, Confederation Trough and Rushup Edge, under the alias the Tuss, Cornish slang for ""erection"". Media sources speculated about James's involvement, but his identity was not confirmed until 2014.
In 2009 Rephlex Records released digital versions (in the FLAC file format) of the 11 Analord EPs. Each of them (except for Analord 10) had bonus tracks, totalling 81 minutes of new music between them all. Richard later disbanded Rephlex Records, removing the website entirely.
This same year, James began working with the visual artist Weirdcore for graphics for his live shows, debuting at Bloc Festival in Minehead. Weirdcore has continued to work with James on live graphics and music videos.
In 2010 James said he had completed six new albums, including a new version of the unreleased Melodies from Mars. In September 2011 he performed a live tribute to the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki; he performed his remix of Penderecki's ""Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima"" and a version of ""Polymorphia"". The following month, he performed at the Paris Pitchfork Music Festival.

2014–present: Caustic Window, Syro, and return as Aphex Twin
In 2014 a test pressing of a 1994 album recorded under James's pseudonym Caustic Window appeared for sale on Discogs. The album was once intended for sale on James's label Rephlex, but went unreleased. With the consent of James and Rephlex, fans organised a Kickstarter campaign to purchase the record and distribute copies.
Syro, the first album released under the Aphex Twin name since Drukqs in 2001, was released through Warp on 23 September 2014. It was marketed by a teaser campaign including graffiti, a blimp flown over London, and an announcement made via a .onion address accessible through the darknet browser Tor.
In November 2014 James released a set of 21 tracks, Modular Trax, on the audio platform SoundCloud. The tracks were later removed. Over several months in 2015 James anonymously uploaded 230 demo tracks, some dating to the 1980s, to SoundCloud. He said he had released the demos to relieve his family of the pressure to release his archives after he dies. He has continued to occasionally release tracks on the account.
On 23 January 2015 James released Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2, created with robotic instruments including the Disklavier, a computer-controlled player piano. On 8 July 2016 he released the Cheetah EP, backed by a music video for ""CIRKLON3 [Колхозная mix]"", the first official music video for an Aphex Twin track in 17 years. On 17 December, James performed in Houston, Texas at the Day for Night festival, his first American appearance in eight years. A 12-inch vinyl was sold exclusively at the festival, containing two 10-minute tracks, entitled Houston, TX 12.17.16 [Day For Night]. On 3 June 2017 James performed at the Field Day festival and released a limited edition EP, London 03.06.17. The performance was livestreamed on NTS Radio's Youtube channel. On 19 June 2017 a Michigan record store sold an exclusive Aphex Twin record comprising two tracks released on SoundCloud in 2015, entitled 3 Gerald Remix / 24 TSIM 2. On 27 July, Aphex Twin opened an online store with expanded versions of previous albums and new tracks. On 29 July, at the Fuji Rock Festival, a tape limited to 500 copies was released.
Aphex Twin released an EP, Collapse, on 14 September 2018. The EP was announced on 5 August in a garbled press release written in broken English and visually distorted with the same Aphex Twin 3D graphic found in London, Turin and Hollywood. A promotional video for the Collapse EP was to be broadcast on Adult Swim, but was cancelled after failing the Harding test. It was made available online instead, and the video for ""T69 Collapse"" was uploaded to YouTube.
During James' September 2019 tour two 12-inch records were released at performances at Printworks, London, and Warehouse Project, Manchester, entitled ""London"" and ""Manchester"" on James' warp.net site. Official recordings of the sets were released on the 15th of September and 26 December 2019 on Youtube.
Speculations of James's return started after a mysterious website featuring the Aphex Twin logo inside of the word ""London"" was discovered by fans. Its title alluded to 19 August 2023, the same day that the Field Day festival takes place on in London, teasing a possible performance. His return was confirmed on 24 January 2023, when Aphex Twin was announced as a headliner for the festival. Over the next few weeks, several other performances were announced for Europe. At a performance at Sónar on 16 June, an exclusive 12-inch vinyl was released entitled Barcelona 16.06.23. During this festival, large QR code displays with Aphex Twin branding were spotted. This, coupled with posters found in Los Angeles, lead to the discovery of an augmented reality app named ""YXBoZXh0d2lu"". The app was created to tease James' upcoming EP. On 21 June James announced the EP Blackbox Life Recorder 21f / In a Room7 F760, which was released on 28 July. After the release of this EP, the mobile app was updated once again. Using the app to scan the front cover, inner sleeves, trifold insert and vinyl label of Blackbox Life Recorder 21f / In a Room7 F760, would reveal a variety of 3D visuals such as a 3D version of the cover, the EP's songs being playable within the app, and other various artwork. On 19 August, James performed at Field Day and released another exclusive 12-inch vinyl entitled London 19.08.2023. NTS Radio released a 360-degree video recording of the set on 27 August. Again, on 2 September, at a performance at Forwards Bristol, a cassette combining the Barcelona and London releases was released entitled Bristol 02.09.23.

Musical style and influences
Writing for AllMusic, John Bush describes James as a ""pioneer of experimental techno"" who has ""constantly pushed the limits of what can be accomplished with electronic equipment, resulting in forward-thinking and emotionally engaging work that ranges from sublime, pastoral ambience to manic head-rush acid techno"". In a 1996 review, The Independent's Angela Lewis called him a ""maverick of 1990s electronica [who] exemplifies the finest traditions of British pop mischief"". According to Fact magazine, James has ""carved out his own space in the history of electronic music"" across several genres, with his unique melodies being ""the reason he's talked about as not just an electronic innovator but as the sphere's definitive artist"". In 2014 review in the Financial Times, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney described James as a ""musical maverick"" noted for ""yoking different elements together in unpredictable formulations"" and blending ""hard beats and uncanny tones; difficult abstraction and populist melodies"". Music publications have described James variously as ""the Mozart of"" both techno and ambient. Writing in The Guardian in 2001 Paul Lester identified James's lineage as ""electronic greats"" including Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, and Derrick May.

James had no formal music training and is largely self-taught. Prior to becoming a producer, James spent his teens modifying analogue synthesisers and became ""addicted to making noises,"" only later becoming ""interested in listening to other people's stuff"". James states that he spent his initial years ""ignorant of music, apart from acid and techno, where I bought just about everything"". He claimed to have been independently making music similar to acid and techno before encountering the styles, and subsequently became enthusiastic about them. He has cited 808 State's 1988 debut album Newbuild as a major early inspiration. In a 1993 interview, James identified voluntary sleep deprivation as an influence on his productions at that time. He also claimed to have recorded over one thousand unreleased tracks. He later said he experienced synaesthesia and utilised lucid dreaming as a means of developing compositional ideas. Some of James's early work was compared to Brian Eno's ambient releases, but James claimed not to have heard Eno before he began recording.
In a 1993 interview, Simon Reynolds noted that James had only recently explored avant-classical and left-field rock artists including Cage, Stockhausen, Eno, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Can, and had spent a couple of years ""catching up"" on other genres outside techno and house. In 1997 James described himself as a fan of ""old tape and avant-garde music"" such as Stockhausen's ""Song for the Youth"" and the work of American composer Tod Dockstader. He also named works by Erik Satie, Drexciya, Ween, Serge Gainsbourg, and Les Baxter among his favorite albums. When James began programming faster, jungle-inspired breakbeats in the mid-1990s, he named friends and fellow musicians Luke Vibert and Tom Jenkinson as influences. In a 2014 interview, James said of jungle that ""I still think it's the ultimate genre, really, because the people making it weren't musicians,"" and noted that ""for years, I could listen to jungle and nick things from them, but they didn't know I existed."" Along with Vibert and Jenkinson, James helped to spearhead the short-lived drill 'n' bass style, which exaggerated elements of drum and bass, on his Hangable Auto Bulb EP (1995). Acknowledging another influence, James's Rephlex label released Music from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, a compilation of music recorded by the pioneers of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 2019 he described Kraftwerk as a major influence. Although he said he disliked ""rock and roll"", he appreciates Led Zeppelin (as a source of ""great breakbeats""), and Pink Floyd (for their psychedelic music). Asked in 2011 about an artist he would like to work with, James named Kate Bush.
Rephlex Records, which James co-owned with Grant Wilson-Claridge, coined the word ""braindance"" to describe Aphex Twin's music. According to the label: ""Braindance is the genre that encompasses the best elements of all genres, e.g. traditional, classical, electronic music, popular, modern, industrial, ambient, hip-hop, electro, house, techno, breakbeat, hardcore, ragga, garage, drum and bass, etc."" According to Pitchfork's Paul Cooper braindance ""escaped the mind/body binary opposition of electronic music"" while retaining its club roots.
James's music has often been characterised as an example of the ""intelligent dance music"" that began in the 1990s. IDM is mentioned on the home page of the Intelligent Dance Music (IDM) mailing list at Hyperreal.org about the music of Aphex Twin and the Artificial Intelligence Series released by Warp Records. The series features James's recordings as Polygon Window and early productions from artists including Autechre, Black Dog, Richie Hawtin's FUSE project and Speedy J. The term spread to the United States and internet message boards. James responded to the IDM term in a 1997 interview:

I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying, ""this is intelligent and everything else is stupid."" It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.

Image and pseudonyms
James's face, grinning or distorted, is a theme of his album covers, music videos and songs. James said it began as a response to techno producers who concealed their identities:

I did it because the thing in techno you weren't supposed to do was to be recognised and stuff. The sort of unwritten rule was that you can't put your face on the sleeve. It has to be like a circuit board or something. Therefore I put my face on the sleeve. That's why I originally did it. But then I got carried away.
The cover of ...I Care Because You Do features a self-portrait painted by James, and that of Richard D. James Album has a close-up photograph. His face is superimposed on the bodies of other people in the music videos for ""Come to Daddy"" and ""Windowlicker"". Near the end of the second track of the ""Windowlicker"" single (known as ""Formula""), a photo of James's face is a steganogram which is revealed as a spectrogram. Another image of James and collaborator Tom Jenkinson is embedded (in SSTV format) with text in the third track of 2 Remixes by AFX, ""Bonus High Frequency Sounds"".
James has recorded as AFX, Blue Calx, Bradley Strider, the Universal Indicator, Caustic Window, Smojphace, GAK, PBoD (Phonic Boy on Dope), Polygon Window, Power-Pill, Q-Chastic, Dice Man, the Tuss, Soit-P.P and user18081971. In a 1997 interview, he said: ""There's really no big theory. It's just things that I feel right in doing at the time and I really don't know why. I select songs for certain [names] and I just do it. I don't know what it means."" In 2001 he commented on the speculation connected to many anonymous electronic artists: ""A lot of people think everything electronic is mine. I get credited for so many things, it's incredible. I'm practically everyone, I reckon—everyone and nobody.""

Influence and legacy
Writing in The Guardian in 2001 journalist Paul Lester described James as ""the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music"". Rolling Stone described James as a ""hugely influential electronic musician whose ambient washes of sound and freakishly twisted beats have gone on to inform artists of all genres."" AllMusic's John Bush wrote that ""unlike most artists who emerged from the '90s techno scene, James established himself as a genuine personality, known for his cheeky grin and nightmare-inducing music videos as much as his groundbreaking albums and EPs,"" which helped to ""expand his audience from ravers and critics to rock fans, with numerous non-electronic musicians citing him as an inspiration"".
In 2001 Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk cited Aphex Twin (particularly ""Windowlicker"") as an influence on their 2001 album Discovery. Bangalter said he liked it because ""it wasn't a big club beat, but it also wasn't a laid back, quiet one"". Artists including Mike Edwards of Jesus Jones, Steve Reich, Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit, Skrillex, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, Matty Healy of the 1975,Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, and Nick Zammuto of the Books have expressed admiration for Aphex Twin or cited him as an influence.
James influenced Radiohead's transition to electronic music for their 2000 album Kid A. In 2013, the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, said Aphex Twin was his biggest influence: ""He burns a heavy shadow ... Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking electric guitar ... I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind of my age too."" In 2002, asked if he would tour with Radiohead, James said ""I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them"". However, James said in 2011 that his dislike of Radiohead had been exaggerated by the press and that he had contacted Yorke to explain this.
In 2005 Alarm Will Sound released Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin, featuring acoustic arrangements of James's electronic tracks. The London Sinfonietta performed arrangements of Aphex Twin songs in 2006. Animator David Firth sampled Aphex Twin in his work. In 2012 Fact named Selected Ambient Works 85–92 the best album of the 1990s.

Personal life
James has made ""wild and essentially unverifiable claims"" about his personal life in interviews, including the claim that he inherited the name of a dead older brother. He has described himself as ""just some irritating, lying, ginger kid from Cornwall who should have been locked up in some youth detention centre. I just managed to escape and blag it into music."" In a 1993 interview, he claimed to only sleep two to three hours per night. In the mid-1990s, James bought a disused bank in the Elephant & Castle area of London, where he claimed to live in a converted bank vault. He falsely claimed in a 2001 interview to have bought the steel structure in the centre of the Elephant Square roundabout, though this is in fact the Michael Faraday Memorial which houses an electricity substation for the London Underground. In the 1990s, James bought a 1950s armoured car, complete with a working machine gun, which he claimed to drive around Cornwall in lieu of a car.
In a 2010 interview with Fact, James said he is living in Scotland after relocating from London. As of 2014, he lives in a village near Glasgow in Scotland with his two sons from his first marriage and his second wife, Anastasia, a Russian art student. His sister Julie James is a Welsh Labour politician who was appointed the Welsh Minister for Climate Change in 2021.
In a 2014 interview, James mentioned that he finds it challenging to live in a small village: ""You have to speak to everybody, and everybody knows your business. For someone like me, who’s a little bit autistic or something, it can be quite intense."" He also mentioned he does not own a smartphone.

Archive (band),"Archive are a musical group based in London, England, whose music spans electronic, trip hop, avant-garde, post-rock and progressive rock. Over their 28-year history, the band has released twelve studio albums and enjoyed established success throughout Europe.

History
Londinium & Take My Head (1994–1999)
Archive was formed in 1994 as a trip-hop band when Darius Keeler and Danny Griffiths formed up with Roya Arab and rapper Rosko John. After releasing a few singles on their own label, they broke up in early 1996 following a dispute. A few months later, the group reformed with new personnel and began recording their debut album. Londinium was released on Island Records in September 1996. The album featured a mix of dark trip hop, electronica, string arrangements and classically influenced songwriting. However, creative differences on the follow-up resulted in the band once again breaking up.
In 1997, Keeler and Griffiths regrouped and continued Archive with another female singer, Suzanne Wooder. In 1999, Archive released their second studio album on Independiente, entitled Take My Head. The album features a mix of pop and symphonic trip hop, far more melodic than its predecessor. Due to differences of musical taste with an undisclosed number of producers the band tried to work with on the album, they have described it as their least favorite album the band recorded.

Craig Walker era (2000–2004)
In 2000, Keeler and Griffiths began to demo new tracks for further studio production. After establishing a new sound to work with, the boys placed an advert in Mojo magazine, looking for a new lead singer. Craig Walker answered the advert and immediately began working with the band and singing on the tune that Darius wrote, entitled, ""Again"".
Between 2002 and 2005, the band released three studio albums with Walker to further growing popularity and critical acclaim. ""You All Look The Same To Me"" (2002), ""Noise"" (2004), and ""Michel Vaillant"" were albums that marked a turning point of the Archive sound that gradually turned away from their roots in electronica and trip hop and towards more of a psychedelic and progressive style. One of the three composed albums was the soundtrack to the French film Michel Vaillant, released in November 2003. In winter of 2014, teaser music from the band's upcoming album was used for a TV advertisement for Meetic.
In November 2004, Archive began their European tour without Walker, posting on their website that Walker would not be joining the band as he has left Archive due to personal differences.

Collective phase (2004–present)
In Autumn of 2004, Archive announced that Dave Pen (BirdPen) would replace Walker on the Noise tour. During this same tour, Keeler and Griffiths met the singer Pollard Berrier (formerly of the band Bauchklang) at one of their shows in Vienna, Austria. Pollard had given Darius a demo CD of his own written material, with the intention of starting another project with Dan and Darius. Because of the latter circumstances, the three began writing and rehearsing together, and were recording in Southside Studios, London, by September 2005. A new modern era for Archive had begun with Darius, Dan and Pollard all writing and co-writing seven tracks and Dave Pen co-writing three, on the album, ""Lights"". Maria Q sang on three (including backing) tracks. From this point on, Archive was no longer a ""front-man-band"", but a ""collective"" of individual artists contributing to what is now an established sound. The album ""Lights"" was released in May 2006 and received high critical acclaim in France, Switzerland, Greece and Poland. Archive enjoyed predominantly sold-out gigs on their ""Lights"" Tour, as well as high acclaim at festivals around Europe.
In May 2009, Archive returned to release their most acclaimed album to date, ""Controlling Crowds I-III"". It reached number one in the French charts for a week, number one in Greece, number two in Switzerland and number 5 in Luxembourg. The single, ""Bullets"", was their most acclaimed single to date and reached the charts in Greece, Poland, Switzerland, France, and Germany. It has also been featured in the teaser trailer for Cyberpunk 2077. The biggest surprise of this album was the return of Rosko John, who adds an unforeseen depth to the seventh studio album. In September 2009, the follow-up album ""Controlling Crowds: Part IV"" was released, along with single ""The Empty Bottle"". Archive continued their ""Controlling Crowds"" tour, having already sold out some fifty concerts from September 2009 - February 2010, up to and extensively for the 2010 Summer Festival Season.

With Us Until You're Dead
Archive have worked on their eighth studio album (excluding Michel Vaillant) in London and Paris; under new management, having finished their deal with Warner Music - This has enlivened hopes in their home country of an official release at last. As early as November 2011, short samples of new works featured on the band's official website.
In May 2012, the band confirmed via the website that the album, titled With Us Until You're Dead, would be released on 27 August from their own label Dangervisit Records. It was accompanied by a European tour starting in October, to which a London show was promptly added. Fusing orchestral, electronic, soulful, progressive and emotional elements, Keeler describes the new material in comparison to previous works as ""more personal - love songs basically. But coming at the subject matter in that non-formatted Archive way."" Fans heard a new song, Violently, featuring new vocalist Holly Martin, which was released as part of the Wiped Out / Violently EP on 2 July.

Axiom
In November 2013, Archive announced details of their most ambitious project to date, a forty-minute short film and accompanying album set for release in May 2014.
The film was created with the help of Spanish film collective NYSU. Director Jesus Hernandez said of the film: ""Archive has produced a great album that works like an entire movie script... Our challenge was to translate the band’s script into images."" The film is set on Axiom, an island in the middle of nowhere with steep cliffs on all sides. On the island there is an underground city dominated by a bell, which decides the fate of the city's inhabitants.
The album, titled Axiom, was officially released on 26 May 2014. The band debuted the short film and performed live at the 2014 Sundance London film festival.

Restriction
On 20 October 2014 Archive announced their upcoming album Restriction which was released on 12 January 2015. Videos for the tracks ""Black And Blue"", ""Kid Corner"" and ""Feel It"" are available for viewing on the official website.

The False Foundation
On 7 October 2016 Archive released their tenth album The False Foundation. The band released music videos for ""Driving In Nails"", ""Bright Lights"" and ""The False Foundation"".

25
To celebrate their 25 years of activity, in May 2019 the band released a massive retrospective collection called ""25"". The standard edition features 26 tracks drawn from the band's career, including new and previously unreleased songs - including collaborations with Band of Skulls and Steve Mason. The 4 CD deluxe edition contains 42 tracks.

Versions
In 2020 Archive released the remix album Versions, a collection of 10 previously released songs that were remixed or re-recorded to generate mostly more quiet and atmospheric versions.

Call To Arms & Angels
On 29 April 2022 Archive released their twelfth studio album Call To Arms & Angels recorded at RAK Studios and produced by Jérome Devoise. The album features 17 tracks and is accompanied by the documentary Super8: A Call To Arms & Angels. Archive released music videos for the tracks ""Shouting Within"", ""Fear There & Everywhere"", ""We Are The Same"", and ""Frying Paint"". The album introduces Lisa Mottram as the band's new vocalist.
The associated tour, scheduled for autumn 2022, had to be postponed in August 2022 by one year due to Darius Keeler's treatment for colon cancer.

Uwe Schmidt,"Uwe H. Schmidt (born 27 August 1968), also known as Atom™, Atom Heart, or Señor Coconut, is a German composer, musician and producer of electronic music. He was active in the development of electrolatino, electrogospel, and aciton music. In the nineties, Schmidt moved to Chile and developed part of his career there, adopting the alias Señor Coconut.

Biography
1983–1990
Uwe Schmidt was born in Frankfurt. He began making music in the early 1980s, first playing drums, then switching to programming a drum computer after he had heard a Linn Drum on the radio. In 1986, he co-founded the cassette label N.G. Medien, on which various tapes of international artists, including the Canadian electronic body music act Frontline Assembly and his first musical work under the name Lassigue Bendthaus, entitled The Engineer's Love, were released.
Soon after, he started to work on what would become his first official Lassigue Bendthaus record release, the album Matter. The recordings and production for Matter began in 1986 and took almost four years, until the album finally came out in 1991 on the German Parade Amoureuse label. Matter as well as its related singles and maxi-singles were recorded and mixed by Tobias Freund (Pink Elln). That same year, he released his debut dancefloor track, 'Whitehouse'. More releases followed on labels like Cyclotron, Rising High, and Pod Communications, for which (as Atom Heart) he co-created with Ata and Heiko the 12"" vinyl Mihon.
Lassigue Bendthaus, until that point, was musically categorized as EBM, even though part of the success of Matter may have been the fact that it did not quite fit the category and already incorporated musical elements of the 1990s. Uwe Schmidt played his first live show as Lassigue Bendthaus as the opening act for the British group Meat Beat Manifesto at the Frankfurt Batschkapp in 1989.

1991–1994
Still living in Frankfurt, Uwe Schmidt was directly influenced by the emerging ""pre-techno"" movement of the late 1980s known as house and acid house. A sub-label of Parade Amoureuse released some of Schmidt's dance floor oriented productions under the alias Atom Heart which he adopted as his main artist name from then on. The early 1990s saw a series of 12-inch vinyl productions, mainly aimed at the dance floor, which were released under a variety of different project titles such as Atom Heart, Slot, etc.
In 1992, he was in charge of producing a series of tracks for the yet to be widely known DJs Pascal F.E.O.S. (Resistance D), Ata and Heiko M/S/O (Ongaku). Uwe Schmidt produced and co-wrote titles such as ""Ongaku"" and ""Cosmic Love"", which became successful prototypes for the appearing trance movement. His activities as a music producer continued with the Austrian multimedia artists Station Rose whom had just moved from Vienna to Frankfurt in 1992. The 12-inch ""Digit Eyes"" was produced by Schmidt and Station Rose the same year. During the production of ""Digit Eyes"" he was introduced to Tetsu Inoue, a New York-based Japanese electronic music producer, with whom he founded the Datacide project in 1993.
Out of the N.G. Medien nucleus the record label POD Communication was founded in 1992. After the bankruptcy of Parade Amoureuse and its sub-labels in 1992, Schmidt moved his activities to POD Communication on which he released a series of 12-inches and albums under the guises of Atom Heart, Lisa Carbon and Atomu Shinzo. Also releasing on POD Communication was the German artist Pete Namlook whom Uwe Schmidt first met at the POD office in Frankfurt. Due to his releases on Parade Amoureuse and POD Communication and his successful production works, Schmidt had quickly obtained a reputation that let him play live concerts all around the world. Together with Tobias Freund, who by then used the Pink Elln pseudonym, Schmidt played a live show at one of the first rave parties ever in Finland in 1992. The live concert was recorded and released on Ongaku Music in 1992, known as ""Elektronikkaa – Atom Heart & Pink Elln live in Montreux and Helsinki"".
A vast amount of productions were released worldwide due to the licensing activities of POD Communication, Ongaku Music and a variety of other Frankfurt-based record companies. After Parade Amoureuse closed down in 1992, his first album Matter was re-released by the Italian record label Contempo Records from Florence.
In 1993, Schmidt released the follow-up album to Matter: Lassigue Bendthaus' Cloned. Cloned was produced and licensed to Contempo Records together with a sample CD titled Cloned:Binary which contained the sounds used on the original album. Contempo Records went bankrupt in 1993.
Due to open payments by those labels, lack of a recording studio and unresolved recording contracts, Schmidt decided to take some months off and lived for half a year in Costa Rica (end of 1992 until early 1993). On the way back from Costa Rica, he stopped over in New York City, where he visited Tetsu Inoue to record the first Datacide album. Back home in Frankfurt, his interest in Latin Music started to grow and in fact the birth of the Señor Coconut moniker can be located somewhere around that time. Even though Lassigue Bendthaus had not brought him much luck until then, he decided to start recording his third album during 1993 entitled Render. Because of the stagnation and inherent ignorance of the techno movement that surrounded Schmidt's work, he soon began to distance from this musical format and scene. He also felt that the DJ and the dance floor were limiting targets for his musical output and that many of his musical ideas would not be compatible with it. As a consequence he founded his own record label Rather Interesting in 1994.
By this time, Pete Namlook had founded his FAX +49-69/450464 label and a new scene of musical styles appeared, such as ambient, jungle, IDM and others. Schmidt collaborated with Namlook under the names Millenium (for Pod) and as Subsequence (for FAX).
Uwe Schmidt, apart from his monthly release on Rather Interesting, continued recording with Tetsu Inoue (Datacide), Pete Namlook (Jet Chamber) and Victor Sol (+N) during 1994. That same year, the Lassigue Bendthaus albums Render, Render Audible (U.S. Remixes), Matter (second re-release), Cloned (first re-release) and the 12-inch ""Overflow"" were released by the Belgian KK Records, a label that would officially declare bankruptcy in 2000. Right after the release and re-release of the Lassigue Bendthaus albums, Schmidt began to work on the last album to be released under that project name called Pop Artificielle.

1995–1998
In 1995, Uwe Schmidt collaborated with Bill Laswell and Tetsu Inoue on the Fax release Second Nature, which was recorded at Laswell's studio in Brooklyn. Toward the end of 1995, another collaboration was concretized in Tokyo where Schmidt, Inoue, and Yellow Magic Orchestra founder Haruomi Hosono recorded the first HAT album, which was released on Schmidt's Rather Interesting label and Haruomi Hosono's Daisy World Discs. In an effort to escape the German winter, Schmidt spent the ends of 1994 and 1995 in Australia. A man with the same idea was the German music producer Bernd Friedmann, whom he met in Melbourne in 1995.
Two more +N and Datacide albums were produced between 1993 and 1996 as well as one album each month on Rather Interesting, all of them under different names that Schmidt later refers to as working titles, headlines, or simply ""words that label a musical idea"" rather than being aliases or projects in the traditional sense. Logically all works of Uwe Schmidt would later be summarized under just one name: Atom™. With a lot of traveling, playing live shows worldwide, such as the Love Parade in 1994 and Sonar Barcelona in 1994, as well as the stagnation to be felt in his European surroundings, Schmidt prepared for his departure from the old continent. Together with Dandy Jack, with whom he formed the project Gon, two live shows were played in Santiago de Chile in March and October 1996. Schmidt and the Chilean Dandy Jack, who lived all his life in Germany and Spain, on their way back from Chile, decided to try to relocate to Santiago in 1997.
1996 finally saw Schmidt's Señor Coconut idea come to realization. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts during 1993–1995, still living in Frankfurt, he recorded eight tracks in the later declared electrolatino style. In a fever dream, the name Señor Coconut, placed on top of a coconut texture, a design that would become the artwork of the first Señor Coconut album, appeared to him. Even though Schmidt tried to complete the album in Frankfurt, the preparations for his move to Chile prevented this. In March 1997, Schmidt, together with his colleague Dandy Jack, moved to Santiago de Chile, where they shared a rented house and installed their studios. During March and April, he finished the El Gran Baile album, which would be the first work bearing the name of Señor Coconut.
Uwe Schmidt continued releasing one album per month on his Rather Interesting label, although due to the difficulties of adaptation in Chile, decided to reduce his output. Akashic Records, a Tokyo-based label owned by Tōwa Tei, licensed El Gran Baile for the territory of Japan. Tōwa Tei further requested a remix by Uwe Schmidt. By the end of 1997 Uwe Schmidt and Dandy Jack's ways split and Uwe moved out of the shared house (while Dandy Jack moved back to Germany one year later).
During 1998, Tetsu Inoue and Haruomi Hosono visited Uwe in Santiago. The second HAT album was recorded. Toward the end of 1998, on his way back from Australia to Germany, Bernd Friedmann stopped over in Santiago and together with Uwe Schmidt they recorded their first Flanger album called Templates, which was recorded in a programming tour de force of one week at Uwe's Mira, Musica! studio and released in 1999 on the British Ninja Tune label.

1999–2003
Lassigue Bendthaus' last album, Pop Artificielle, was finally finished and released in 1999. Due to a record company decision the album was released under the name of LB. Pop Artificielle caused quite a media reaction worldwide, due to the fact that the album contained electronic cover versions of famous pop and rock songs. Pop Artificielle stylistically may be considered as being one of the first productions that merged song structures with sounds coming from a '90s techno background. Many refer to it as an initial point for the development of the glitch genre.
During the production process of Pop Artificielle, the idea was born to cover the German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk in a yet-to-be-defined style and as a different production. Meant to be rough sketches, Uwe Schmidt started to program a couple of Kraftwerk cover versions in traditional cha-cha-cha arrangement and decided to make this the second Señor Coconut album. Entertained by the result of the first programmings, he produced a total of 4 songs which he sent to some record companies. One of those companies, Tōwa Tei's Akashic Records, immediately licensed the album, entitled El Baile Alemán, releasing it upon completion of the production in 2000. Uwe Schmidt obtained official permission by Kraftwerk themselves to release El Baile Alemán, though had to remove his version of ""Radioactivity"". European and North American record companies remained uninterested until triggered by the hype El Baile Alemán had caused in Japan. Soon a European, North American, Mexican, Hong Kong and a Russian release followed and the title ""Showroom Dummies"" was featured in the Mexican movie Y Tu Mamá También.
Señor Coconut's first European tour started on 19 August 2000 in Germany. A US headlining tour was scheduled, but had to be canceled because of visa problems of one of the 7 Chilean musicians that accompanied Schmidt. In parallel to Señor Coconut project, Schmidt continued working on rather obscure ideas, some for Rather Interesting, some that were released on other labels, such as the Geeez 'n' Gosh (2000 and 2002) albums which musically merge abstract electronic programmings and gospel vocals. Geeez 'n' Gosh was released on the German Mille Plateaux label, which went bankrupt in 2004, leaving Schmidt as well as many fellow musicians, unpaid. The Flanger project was also continued, Friedman and Schmidt recording the Inner Space/Outer Space album in Santiago de Chile, which was then released in 2001.

2004–2008
Apart from his own productions and various collaborations he was solicited to remix artists such as Depeche Mode, Martin L. Gore, Air, Cesária Évora, Juan García Esquivel, Sketch Show, Tōwa Tei, Moreno Veloso, Merzbow and many others. An exclusive track entitled ""White Car"" was produced for and released on the Japanese anime movie, Appleseed. Still, Uwe Schmidt spent most of the time touring with his Señor Coconut moniker, which had grown to a full 9-man orchestra. The Señor Coconut album Yellow Fever! was released in 2006. The album contained cover versions of Yellow Magic Orchestra songs and became a very successful release in Japan. Amongst the YMO members themselves (Haruomi Hosono, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi) a large number of musicians appeared on this album such as Mouse on Mars, Akufen, Jorge González and others. Yellow Fever! was performed live at Sónar Sound Tokyo the same year, with both Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi performing each one song with the full orchestra on stage. The Señor Coconut album Around the World was released. It contains guest participations of Stephan Remmler (Trio) and the Austrian crooner Louie Austen.

2009–present
Uwe Schmidt's Rather Interesting label remains his largest unified body of work. To date, R.I. alone has over 46 full-length releases under numerous aliases and styles, of which most of them are written, recorded, mixed and mastered by Schmidt himself. Additionally, Schmidt handles all the label management and most all of the album artwork and design.
Remixes for Les, Pérez Prado, Jamie Lidell, Plaid and Japanese superstar Kumi Koda have been continuing to garner attention for Uwe Schmidt. The collaboration Surtek Collective with Vicente Sanfuentes, invented yet another musical style called aciton, a blend of acid and reggaeton. Surtek Collective mainly tours Latin America, playing shows in Mexico, Venezuela, Brasil, Argentina and Chile.
The Flanger album Spirituals was released in 2005 on Bernd Friedmann's label Nonplace and the HEADZ label for the Japanese territory. A couple of years later songs from Spirituals got licensed for the Hungarian movie Bibliotheque Pascal.
From 2007 until 2010, collaborating with Japanese composer Masaki Sakamoto, he produces the album Alien Symphony and the modified (online) version of it, called Meteor Shower which was released in 2010. The same year sees Atom™ acting a mini-role in the Mexican movie Orol. By the end of 2010 a short South American tour is played with the Sr. Coconut project.
Atom™, in collaboration with Japanese musician Toshiyuki Yasuda produces a cover version of the Brazilian Bossa Nova classic ""Aguas de Março"", pre-released on the compilation Red Hot 2 in June 2011. The vocals on this song are performed by Fernanda Takai and Moreno Veloso.
A photo exhibition called Winterreise was unveiled in Tokyo in May 2011, accompanied by a Playbutton release. Atom™ performances at the Lincoln Center in New York City, Communikey Festival in Boulder, the Raster-Noton/Mute festival at the Roundhouse in London, Labyrinth Festival in Japan plus many others. Exclusive contributions to Ryuichi Sakamoto's Kizunaworld project and Tōwa Tei's Mach online platform.
A second Winterreise exhibition was held in Frankfurt (Germany) in October 2011 as well as the Winterreise soundtrack was released in May 2012 through Raster-Noton. atom-tm.com was launched in July 2012 and serves as Atom™'s official news platform and archive. As a result of the Winterreise release, Atom™ received an invitation from Richie Hawtin to play an ambient set at his club in Ibiza. The invitation was accepted and the then entitled Alpha txt ambient set created, which was then again performed, opening the Labyrinth festival in September the same year. An initially abandoned album, which in 2005 carried the working title Hard Disc Rock (as a self-reference to the 1997 Atom™ title with the same name), resurfaced as HD, after some of the unfinished tracks raised interest at the Raster-Noton label. The album was finished during the second half of 2012, and mixed down during January 2013. The release of HD was then scheduled for March 2013. In the middle of the HD production, the terrible news of Pete Namlook's sudden death reach Schmidt. Months later, as a practical consequence of Namlook's passing away, the Rather Interesting label, which both Pete and Atom ran together since 1994, was shut down forever. Early 2013 sees Atom™ playing various live shows, such as the double opening feature at Berlin's CTM.13, where he first performs Bauteile with colleague Marc Behrens, and later on, together with Material Object, plays a three-hour Alpha txt set. Extensive promotional activities for HD, which, amongst other results, bring Atom™ on the front page of Germany's De:bug magazine and the preparation for the HD and Ground Loop live sets keep Atom™ busy during the first couple of months of 2013.

Interview about the recording of ""Yellow Fever"" album."
Autechre,"Autechre () are an English electronic music duo consisting of Rob Brown and Sean Booth, both from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Formed in 1987, they are among the best known acts signed to UK electronic label Warp Records, through which all of Autechre's full-length albums have been released beginning with their 1993 debut Incunabula. They gained initial recognition when they were featured on Warp's 1992 compilation Artificial Intelligence.
Influenced by styles such as 1980s electro and hip hop, the music of Autechre has evolved throughout their career from early, melodic techno recordings to later works often considered abstract and experimental, featuring complex composition and few stylistic conventions. Their work has been associated with the 1990s electronic genre known as intelligent dance music (IDM), though Booth has dismissed the label as ""silly.""

History
Early years (1987–1992)
Brown and Booth met through Manchester's graffiti scene in 1987 when they both lived in Rochdale. Heavily influenced by electro-funk, hip hop and acid house, they began trading mixtapes and then creating their own compositions while collecting a handful of cheap equipment, most notably a Casio SK-1 sampler and a Roland TR-606 drum machine. Their first release was Lego Feet, a 12"" recorded under an alias of the same name brought out by Manchester's Skam Records.
Their first release as Autechre was the single ""Cavity Job"" in 1991, released on Hardcore Records. Booth and Brown pronounce the name Autechre with a Rochdale accent ( aw-TEK-ər). However, they have explained that the name can be pronounced in any way one sees fit. Booth said: ""The first two letters were intentional, because there was an 'au' sound in the track, and the rest of the letters were bashed randomly on the keyboard. We had this track title for ages, and we had written it on a cassette, with some graphics. It looked good, and we began using it as our name.""
Two more tracks appeared in 1992 under the now finalised Autechre name, on the Warp Records compilation Artificial Intelligence, part of the series of the same name. The compilation contained ""The Egg"", later reworked for their first full-length release under the title ""Eggshell"".
Two hours of early material was broadcast live on NTS Radio during Warp's 30th-anniversary weekend, called Warp Tapes 89-93. It is distributed for free on Autechre's Bleep Store in digital audio format.

Incunabula and Amber (1993–1994)
In 1993 Warp released their debut album, Incunabula, which became a surprise success, reaching the top of the UK Indie Chart. The album had a cool, calculated feel, with clear techno and electro roots, but also showed hints of the rhythmic flourishes and tuned percussion that would later become an important feature of their work. An EP of remixes of Incunabula's ""Basscadet"" was released in 1994, with animated computer graphics for the Bcdtmx version created by Jess Scott-Hunter. This music video featured on MTV Europe's Party Zone when Autechre were interviewed during the show in September that year. 1994 also saw the release of Amber, an album featuring a more ambient, less percussive approach than their debut.
The Anti EP was released shortly before Amber and is, as of yet, the only Autechre release to have an explicit purpose: it was a protest against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which would prohibit raves, defined as any gathering of nine or more people where rave music is played. Rave music was defined as music which ""includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats"". The record came wrapped in a seal, on which was printed a legal warning: ""Flutter has been programmed in such a way that no bars contain identical beats and can therefore be played at both forty-five and thirty-three revolutions under the proposed new law. However, we advise DJs to have a lawyer and musicologist present at all times to confirm the non-repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment.""
In a 2008 interview with Pitchfork Media, Rob Brown mentioned that Incunabula and Amber, retrospectively, sounded ""cheesy"". Brown later clarified that ""they were perhaps more simple, but not in a shit way.""

Tri Repetae, Chiastic Slide and LP5 (1995–1999)
1995 saw the release of Tri Repetae, their third album, as well as the EPs Anvil Vapre and Garbage, featuring a monochrome cover designed by The Designers Republic, with whom Autechre have long held a close association. Tri Repetae and its associated EPs were combined into a two disc set entitled Tri Repetae++, which was released in the United States. An official promotional video was created for ""Second Bad Vilbel"" from Anvil Vapre by English visual artist Chris Cunningham (his first). The ""Second Bad Vilbel"" video featured rapidly cut shots of industrial machinery and robotic movement, synchronised with the music. Cunningham later re-edited the video in 2002, following his disappointment with the original: ""It was intended to be completely abstract but it didn't quite work out that way"". A two track vinyl-only EP entitled We R Are Why, was available to buy during certain concerts and via mail order during 1996. Also in 1995, Autechre's track ""Nonima"" was featured on Mind The Gap Volume 5, a Belgian compilation of electronic music.
Autechre released three records in 1997: the full-length Chiastic Slide, and the EPs Envane and Cichlisuite (pronounced ""sickly sweet""). The latter EP consists of five remixed versions of ""Cichli"" from Chiastic Slide. Radio Mix was also released in 1997; a rare CD-only promotional recording, it contains an hour-long DJ mix of other artists' tracks, some of them remixed by Autechre, as well as a short interview edited sometimes to the point of incomprehensibility.
An untitled record (typically known as LP5 or simply Autechre) followed in 1998. It has been seen as a transitional work, with Brown commenting in 2005 that ""a lot of people have cited it as a classic Autechre album because it bridges the gap between the guys who liked our old stuff and the guys who got propelled on to our new stuff.""
1999 saw the release of their first Peel session EP, consisting of three tracks broadcast on John Peel's show for BBC Radio 1 in October 1995, as well as a vinyl-only limited edition promotional EP entitled Splitrmx12. 1999 also saw EP7, which is classed by the group as an EP despite the CD version being over an hour in length.

Confield, Draft 7.30 and Untilted (2000–2007)
The new millennium brought about a drastic change in Autechre's style, demonstrated by Confield (2001) and Draft 7.30 (2003), as well as the Gantz Graf EP (2002). The title track from Gantz Graf inspired an iconic video by British designer Alex Rutterford, featuring an object (or an agglomeration of objects) synchronised to the music as it morphs, pulsates, shakes and finally dissolves. Rutterford, who had previously created an unofficial video for the Tri Repetae track ""Eutow"" as part of the Channel 4 music programme Lo-Fi in 2001, claimed the idea for the ""Gantz Graf"" video came during one of his LSD trips. The second Autechre Peel session EP was also released in 2002, containing four tracks broadcast in 1999, named by John Peel himself. Autechre released three collaborative albums with Andrew M. McKenzie's Hafler Trio collective during the following five years (see collaborations).
Metacritic rated the critical reviews to Confield as ""universal acclaim"". According to Sean Booth, ""most of Confield came out of experiments with Max that weren't really applicable in a club environment."" In contrast, 2003's Draft 7.30 was seen by some as an easier record to grasp. Booth stated in an interview around the release of Draft 7.30 that ""[rhythm] doesn't seem to limit us in the way it did when we first started. Now I think we just get it, we're totally fluent in it and can be more expressive.""
Untilted (a play on the word ""untitled""), the duo's eighth album, was released in 2005. It roughly continued the sound of their previous two LPs, though featured compositions that mutated greatly during their duration, typically alternating between passages of ambience and heavily processed, precise beats, such as on ""Ipacial Section"". Its final track, ""Sublimit"", is at almost sixteen minutes; Autechre's longest composition to feature on any of their albums until 2016's elseq 1–5. The release of Untilted was followed by a two-month tour that took the group around Europe, America and Japan, but withdrew them from studio work for an unusual length of time. The outcome of this, coupled with a forced change in studio setup, was a gap of three years between releases, longer than ever before.

Quaristice, Oversteps and Exai (2008–2013)
Their ninth album, Quaristice, was released in early 2008. In contrast to Untilted, it is made up of twenty tracks, more than any other Autechre release, each typically around 2 to 5 minutes in length. The download-only Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae EP that accompanies it (as well as the Versions bonus disc and three tracks released exclusively through the Japanese iTunes Store) brings the total length of music released during their Quaristice era to over five hours. Among this is the hour-long ""Perlence subrange 6-36"" that closes the EP. Each track on Quaristice was edited down from lengthy improvised sessions between Booth and Brown, some of which were released in longer versions on Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae. Although Sean Booth has stated that the FLAC release of Quaristice is the actual product, the album was also released by Warp Records as a double LP and a single CD as well as an elaborate two CD edition by Warp Records. Limited to only 1,000 copies, and containing both the regular album and Quaristice (Versions), this special edition was packaged in a photo-etched steel case. It sold out within 12 hours of being announced.
On 13 January 2010, Warp Records announced Oversteps, Autechre's tenth album. Originally slated to be released in March, it was released a month early in digital form on Bleep.com to those who preordered it; the CD and deluxe vinyl editions were released on 22 March 2010. A two-month European tour occurred in support of the album, followed by limited shows in Japan and Australia, the latter breaking a 15-year absence. Autechre then compiled a mix for the magazine FACT, released in February of the same year, that consisted of tracks by artists such as J Dilla and Necrophagist. On 25 May 2010, Warp Records announced the ten track Move of Ten, an EP by the duo in conjunction with the release of Oversteps. The digipack CD and the two 12"" vinyl version, as well as a digital download, was released on 12 July 2010.
In April 2011 a boxset of EPs entitled EPs 1991 – 2002 (excluding Move of Ten) was released, with artwork from the Designers Republic. It includes a CD copy of their debut EP, Cavity Job, the first time it has been released on the format. In 2011 as part of Warp's 'Made in Japan' relief concert for the victims of the 2011 Sendai earthquake, an eleven-minute piece was released entitled ""6852"", possibly part of a previous live recording.
The eleventh studio album entitled Exai was released on 5 March 2013, having been available for download from the official website as of 14 February 2013. The duo announced their 14th EP L-Event on 17 September 2013, which was released on 28 October 2013.

AENA tour, AE_LIVE, elseq 1–5, NTS Sessions (2014–2019)
During 2015, the duo embarked on a tour across North America, marketed as AENA. The tour was officially announced on the Warp Records website on 25 May 2015 but promotional material (specifically the logos for the upcoming tour) can be found that was released on 13 August 2014. On 29 October 2015 members of the Autechre mailing list were given invite-only permission to download a live recording from the duo titled AE_LIVE, a collection of four one-hour-long soundboard recordings of a series of concerts that took place in 2014. On 1 November 2015 a Bleep.com substore opened up giving the public the ability to purchase and download the collection.
On 13 May 2016 a new Autechre track by the title of ""feed1"" was played on Tom Ravenscroft's late evening show on BBC 6 Music after an announcement made on the Warp Records Twitter feed which was accompanied by a piece of geometric album art. On 18 May 2016 a second new track was played on KSUA, an Alaskan student radio station, again announced in a tweet by Warp. Afterwards, Warp released the snippet of the Autechre song on their Soundcloud account under the title ""c16 deep tread"". On 19 May 2016, their twelfth studio album, elseq 1-5, on Autechre's AE_STORE_ page. Warp Records have stated that there are no plans to release the album on a physical medium, making the album Autechre's first digital-only studio album release.
On 6 April 2018, a livestream of new material was broadcast on NTS Radio, marking the first of four live streams released every week of the month. On 9 April 2018, it was unveiled that the sessions, totalling eight hours of material, would be packaged and released as NTS Sessions 1–4 with a listing on the AE_STORE, including 12xLP and 8xCD boxsets. The livestreams coincided with the announcement of live sets in Japan and Australia, including their first-ever performance in Tasmania at the Dark Mofo Festival.
In November 2018, Richard Devine joined the user chat room of the electronic music forum We Are The Music Makers and hinted at an easter egg on the AE_STORE website. Following a partially hidden link, the user could download instrument parameter files for Elektron's hardware which Autechre used for the 2008 Quaristice tour. When loaded into a Monomachine or Machinedrum these files allowed the user to create their own Quaristice tour soundboard.

SIGN and PLUS (2020–present)
In April 2020, Autechre released AE_LIVE_2016/2018, a set of tour recordings from those respective years. On 1 September 2020, Warp Records announced that fans should sign up to the Autechre mailing list. Shortly after, Autechre announced their next album, SIGN, which was released on 16 October 2020.
In 2020 interviews, the duo stated that they had been recording material for SIGN since the summer of 2018, after their Australian tour, up to February that year. Booth remarked that the songs were more emotional than other works, and that this was the first album recorded with their revamped systems.
Another album titled PLUS was surprise released digitally on 28 October, with physical and streaming releases planned on 20 November.

Influences
A wide variety of influences have been noted as discernible in Autechre's music. The duo's roots in tagging, early hip hop and electro music, and b-boy culture in general are still evident, with many reviews noting hip hop rhythms—sometimes heavily obscured or processed, and sometimes explicit even in later work. All of Autechre's live webcasts have featured large amounts of early hip hop and electro. In a review of Oversteps, The Wire noted ""Treale"" as being ""a reminder of Booth and Brown's musical apprenticeship as teenage B-boys"". As Autechre's music and studio setup evolved, reviews started to note influences from farther afield; experiments in generative synthesis, musique concrète and FM synthesis drew comparisons with Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Bernard Parmegiani from critics such as Paul Morley. The group have mentioned musique concrète composers Tod Dockstader and Edgard Varèse as influences. Autechre also cite Coil as a major influence, with an unfinished collaboration of unknown completeness occurring around the release of LP5 and EP7. Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated in 2015 that Autechre create ""some of the most complicated music you could ever hope to drown in"" and are ""recognized as pioneers in experimental music"". Autechre's work has been described as ""music that sounds like it designed itself, with audio fractals that change constantly like living organisms.""

Recording
Booth and Brown record tracks collaboratively, but in separate studios with identical software and equipment. The process, as Booth describes in a 2020 interview with The New York Times, involves one sending a track to another, which is sent back with revisions before it is deemed finished. Brown remarks that, although they ""behave differently, we sometimes try to achieve the same goal, but with greatly differing approaches (as) we really do get off on the fact that we're on the same page most of the time.""

Equipment
Autechre use many different digital synths and a few analogue synths in their production, as well as analogue and digital drum machines, such as the Roland R-8, mixers, effects units and samplers. They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesised sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customised by the band themselves. Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as Max/MSP, and Kyma, amongst others, from 1997 onwards. From 2005 until 2009, they have used the Elektron Machinedrum and Monomachine, alongside Akai MPC and Nord Modular in their live performances. It has also been rumoured that Autechre have used military equipment in their work. In 2008, Sean Booth reported that if he were locked in a cell for a year with only one piece of software and one piece of hardware, he'd ""probably take a copy of Digital Performer and an AKG C1000 microphone.""
Other machines that Autechre have repeatedly mentioned in interviews are appreciated for their interface and aesthetics as much as their sound, including the Roland TR-606 and MC-202, and the Nord Lead. According to the 2016 interview to Resident Advisor, both members haven't bought a piece of equipment ""in the last 5 years"", making Max/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that ""in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don't know how to do that it'll generally be worthwhile learning."" Booth said that they use MAX as MIDI ""only handles a limited set of information"" and that instruments like the piano ""separates the artist from the string.""

Collaborations, remixes and covers
Both Booth and Brown are known to have been heavily involved with the majority of releases by the mysterious Gescom collective, although Booth admitted in an interview that around 20 to 30 musicians overall are connected with what he describes as an ""umbrella project"". Three elaborately packaged albums (æ³o & h³æ, æo³ & ³hæ, and ha³oe & ah³eo) have been made by Autechre in collaboration with Andrew M. McKenzie's ongoing Hafler Trio project. These albums are significantly more minimal than any other Autechre release, featuring dense, claustrophobic and noisy drones. A track called ""Elephant Gear"", credited to both Autechre and Canadian breakcore musician Venetian Snares under the alias AEVSVS, was released on a compilation in tribute to Elektron co-founder Daniel Hansson, who died in a car accident. Autechre have collaborated with several artists for live performances, including Zoviet France, Fennesz and Roedelius. 3. Telepathics Meh In-Sect Connection, an album by Sean Booth in collaboration with Mika Vainio of Pan Sonic and Kouhei Matsunaga, was released in early 2010.
In 2009 they contributed a cover of an LFO song to the Warp20 compilation, as well as having their song ""Tilapia"" covered by John Callaghan.
The compilation CD The Only Blip Hop Record You Will Ever Need, Vol.1, issued in 2002 by David Byrne's Luaka Bop Records, contains a cover version of ""Gnit"" performed by Marie + Scratch. It is performed using only human voice samples.
The band Pink Freud has performed covers of several Autechre numbers, including ""Basscadet"", ""Cichli"" and ""Bike"". These live performances are available on YouTube.
Autechre helped initiate the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in 2000, and curated the 2003 festival.

Radio
Autechre have been involved with radio since their early days, originally spinning for IBC Radio, a Manchester pirate radio station in 1991, where they had their own show playing Belgian techno alongside their own demos. Later they would appear as part of Gescom for their weekly ""Disengage"" show on Manchester's Kiss FM.
Booth & Brown are also known to have contributed (anonymously) to the weekly pirate radio show which aired live at midnight Saturday night in Sheffield from 1994–95, hosted by DJ Jez Potter (who went on to found the noted 'Fear Of A Crap Planet' club night in Brighton) alongside fellow Sheffield residents Robert E. Baker, Mark Fell and Mat Steel. No official recordings of these sometimes particularly lengthy broadcasts, often extending to many hours—which featured the above named artists performing using vinyl, tape, CDs, MiniDisc, as well as various hard-and-software—are known to exist.

Webcasts
Autechre have streamed exceptionally long live DJ mixes as webcasts to coincide with the release of four albums so far:

A nearly nine-hour live mix on 10–11 April 2005 (GMT) to coincide with the release of Untilted
A twelve-hour live stream on 23–24 February 2008 to coincide with the release of Quaristice
A twelve-and-a-half-hour live stream spanning 6 pm to 6:30 am (GMT) on 2–3 March 2010 to coincide with the release of Oversteps
Two separate ten-hour live streams from 8 pm to 6 am (GMT) on 2–3 March 2013 to coincide with the release of Exai
A 12-hour mix via radio-streaming platform Mixlr on 13 October 2019
A broadcast of SIGN on 8 October to the Autechre website
A 5½-hour-long mix on Mixlr streamed on 30 December 2022

B. J. Cole,"Brian John Cole (born 17 June 1946) is an English pedal steel guitarist, who has long been active as a session and solo musician. Coming to prominence in the early 1970s with the band Cochise, Cole has played in many styles, ranging from mainstream pop and rock to jazz and eclectic experimental music, but has never forgotten the instrument's roots in country music. Cole plays lap steel and dobro.

Early life and musical beginnings
Cole was born on 17 June 1946 in London. He grew up in Enfield, attending Chase Side primary school and Enfield Chase secondary school for boys. He became interested in music in his teens, his first major inspiration being The Shadows. Cole initially learned to play guitar, but became disillusioned with the instrument, conscious of the number of talented guitarists that were already active on the music scene. Performances by the American duo Santo & Johnny aired on the Perry Como show introduced him to the exotic and unusual sound of the steel guitar, and in 1963, he traded in some toy trains to buy his first lap steel – a Dallas Rangemaster.
Around two years later, Cole first became aware of the pedal steel guitar, and soon acquired his first instrument, a Fender 1000. What had been an enthusiasm now became a passion: Cole began to play in bands in his free time and to become actively involved in the music scene, landing his first ‘proper’ session in 1968; this was for Albert Lee, work which was included on the album Black Claw & Country Fever, released much later, in 1991.

Rise to prominence
In 1968, while playing at a gig in Kingston, South London, Cole was head-hunted to join what was to be an English group conceived on the lines of the Flying Burrito Brothers. The project never got off the ground, but through it Cole was introduced to the singer Stewart Brown, a former member of the band Bluesology with Elton John. In 1969, Brown invited Cole to become a member of the new heavy rock/country band Cochise, with Mick Grabham on guitar, Rick Wills on bass, and Willie Wilson on drums. Cochise enjoyed moderate success, and released three albums – Cochise (Liberty/United Artists, 1970), Swallow Tales (United Artists, 1971) and So Far (United Artists, 1972) – all of which included songs written by Cole. The tracks on these albums were included on a two-disc anthology, Velvet Mountain (Eclectic/Cherry Red), issued in 2013.
Cochise folded in 1972, but through it Cole came into contact with a wide range of active and high-profile musicians, including Andy Fairweather Low and Steve Marriott. He went on to carry out recording sessions with all of them, but his breakthrough moment came in 1971, when he played steel guitar on Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"", included on the album Madman Across the Water.

1970s
Throughout the 1970s, Cole was greatly in demand as a session musician, appearing with artists including: Humble Pie (Cole played on three of their albums, including Eat It of 1973), Roger Daltrey (Daltrey, 1973), Man (Christmas at the Patti, 1973), Kiki Dee (Loving & Free, 1973, and I’ve Got the Music In Me, 1974), Procol Harum (Exotic Birds and Fruit, 1974), T. Rex (Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, 1974), the Walker Brothers (No Regrets, 1975), Uriah Heep (Return to Fantasy, 1975), Andy Fairweather Low (La Booga Rooga, 1975, including ""Wide Eyed and Legless""), Joan Armatrading (""Down to Zero"", 1976), Roy Harper (""One of Those Days in England"", 1977), Gerry Rafferty (City to City, 1978), and Cat Stevens (Back to Earth, 1978).

Cow Pie Records and the Hank Wangford Band
In 1976, Cole went to America for the first time, and returned to England full of excitement and enthusiasm about the music he had heard. His contacts at United Artists – who had signed Cochise – suggested he start a record label to encourage British country artists, and the result was Cow Pie, founded in 1977. Records issued by the label included Nancy Peppers’ Leaving for Better Times (1978).
Cole's search for new British country performers brought him into contact with the singer-songwriter Hank Wangford (the stage name of Dr Sam Hutt), and in 1980 Cow Pie Records issued Wangford's first album, Cowboys Stay on Longer, featuring Cole on pedal steel as well as various friends and fellow musicians including guitarist Andy Roberts and singer Melanie Harrold. Around the same time, Cole (given the stage name ‘Manley Footwear’) was a founder member of the Hank Wangford Band, which Roberts and Harrold joined. The band proved very popular, performing regularly at gigs and festivals. Cole remained a member until 1983, around a year after the demise of Cow Pie. He rejoined Hank's current band in 2008.

Session and live work, 1982 to the present
In the years around 1980, demand for the steel guitar in recorded music experienced a slump, reflecting the popularity of punk and the introduction of the synthesiser. However, Cole continued to attract session work, which he returned to in earnest after the demise of Cow Pie. Credits from the 1980s include performances with: Shakin' Stevens (""Give Me Your Heart Tonight"" and ""Hot Dog"", 1982), Paul Young (""Everything Must Change"", 1985), David Sylvian (Gone to Earth, 1986), The Stranglers (Dreamtime, 1986), Deacon Blue (""Chocolate Girl"", 1987), Dumptruck (For the Country, 1987), and k.d. lang (Angel with a Lariat, 1987).
In the 1990s, Cole toured over a period of five to six years with John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, work which helped to raise his profile internationally. At the end of the decade, he made some select appearances playing live with R.E.M., and joined The Verve for their tour of America, subsequently appearing on Richard Ashcroft's solo album Alone with Everybody (2000). Other session work of this period included contributions to: Peter Blegvad (King Strut and Other Stories, 1990), Gerry Rafferty (On a Wing and a Prayer, 1992), Billie Ray Martin (Four Ambient Tales, 1993), The Orb (Orbus Terrarum, 1995), Echobelly (On, 1995), Björk (Post, 1995), Depeche Mode (Ultra, 1997), Spiritualized (Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, 1997), and the Pet Shop Boys (Nightlife, 1999). Through his solo work, Cole came to the attention of Sting, and he appeared on the albums Mercury Falling (1996), Brand New Day (1999) and All This Time (2001), also performing live in Sting's band.
In more recent years, Cole has remained in demand, his credits including: Eliza Carthy (Angels & Cigarettes, 2000), Robbie Williams (""Eternity"", 2001), Graham Coxon (The Kiss of Morning, 2002), Robert Plant (Dreamland, 2002, and Sixty Six to Timbuktu, 2003), Groove Armada (Lovebox, 2003), David Gilmour (On an Island, 2006), Martin Simpson (True Stories, 2009, and Purpose + Grace, 2011), Katie Melua (The House, 2010), and Tom Jones (Praise & Blame, 2010). In 2012, he was a featured soloist with Icebreaker in a live version of Brian Eno's album Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks. He has also played live with First Aid Kit, Ethan Johns, Michael Messer, the folk singer Bonnie Dobson, and Terry Reid, and has returned to perform with Hank Wangford, appearing at gigs and on albums such as Whistling in the Dark (2008).

Solo work
Cole's solo music has always been experimental, and has involved work as a performer as well as a writer, arranger, mixer and producer. His first solo album was The New Hovering Dog (1972), issued shortly after the breakup of Cochise. The album was remastered and re-released in 2013.
In the 1980s – alongside his session and live performances, and also work as a music journalist – Cole became increasingly interested in ambient and classical music, and the way in which this could be adapted for the pedal steel guitar. A project undertaken with Guy Jackson resulted in Transparent Music (Hannibal/Rykodisc, 1989), including pieces by Erik Satie and others. This was followed by Heart of the Moment (Resurgence, 1995), Lushlife, with Roger Beaujolais and Simon Thorpe (United Artists, 2009), and Transparent Music 2, featuring Guy Jackson, Arve Henriksen and Davy Spillane (United Artists, 2012).
In the late 1990s, a desire to work with a DJ drew Cole to Luke Vibert, the result of their collaboration being Stop the Panic (Cooking Vinyl/Astralwerks, 2000), an electronica album inspired by their shared passion for exotica and drum ‘n’ bass. A similar theme runs through Cole's Trouble in Paradise (Cooking Vinyl, 2004).

Instruments
Cole initially learned on a six-string Dallas Rangemaster lap steel, before buying his first pedal steel – a double eight-string Fender 1000  – in about 1966. He continued to use this until 1971, when he switched to a black single-neck ten-string Emmons pedal steel; this was the instrument that he played on the final Cochise album and on sessions including ‘Tiny Dancer’. In 1975, Cole bought a twelve-string Emmons pedal steel, and then in 1982, while in America, he acquired a new twelve-string instrument made by Joe Kline. This has remained his principal pedal steel until very recently. Cole is now using a twelve-string pedal steel made for him by Bill Rudolph of the Williams Guitar Co. He also plays a dobro custom-made for him by his father, John Cole.

Ben Frost,"Ben Frost (born 1980) is an Australian-born musician, composer, record producer, sound designer and director currently based out of Reykjavík, Iceland. 
Frost has contributed to albums by Canadian electronic musician Tim Hecker and American experimental rock band Swans.

Career
Born in Melbourne, Australia, and based in Reykjavík, Iceland, since 2005, Frost composes minimalist, instrumental, and experimental music, with influences ranging from classical minimalism to punk rock and black metal.
His early releases include the guitar-oriented albums Steel Wound (2003) and School of Emotional Engineering (as part of the band School of Emotional Engineering) (2004). Theory of Machines (2007) marked a radical shift toward more angular aggressive music and was further advanced on the critically acclaimed By The Throat (2009). In 2011, commissioned by Unsound Festival, and as part of a collaboration with Brian Eno and fellow Icelandic composer Daníel Bjarnason, Frost released Solaris, a conceptual album which rescored Andrei Tarkovsky's film of the same name. In 2014 after signing with British record label Mute Records, Frost released the critically lauded and distinctly more rhythmical album Aurora. In 2017 Frost traveled to Chicago to record The Centre Cannot Hold with Steve Albini. In addition to his studio albums, Frost has collaborated with contemporary dance companies Chunky Move, the Icelandic Dance Company Contemporary Dance of Cuba and the British choreographer Wayne McGregor. He composed the music for Wayne McGregor's 2010 production FAR.
Frost co-composed Music for Solaris with Daníel Bjarnason, which was inspired by both Stanisław Lem's novel Solaris and the 1972 Tarkovsky film of the same name. It was performed by Frost, Bjarnason, and Sinfonietta Cracovia. He composed the music for the films Sleeping Beauty, the Icelandic drama The Deep, and the 2015 British television series Fortitude. In 2012, he traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with Richard Mosse, along with Trevor Tweeten to score the sound for Mosse's artwork The Enclave.
In 2013, in his first directorial role, he premiered a critically acclaimed music-theatre adaptation of the Iain Banks novel The Wasp Factory.
In 2015, Frost, in collaboration with Paul Haslinger, created the score for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
Two years later, in 2017, Frost scored the film Super Dark Times. In that same year, he premiered a new installation at the Barbican Centre in London, titled Incoming, with Richard Mosse and Trevor Tweeten. The piece used advanced surveillance technology to comment on the refugee crisis in Europe, and later toured worldwide.
From 2017 to 2020, Frost created the score for all three seasons of Netflix's German sci-fi thriller Dark. In 2022, Frost, Mosse and Tweeten premiered their third collaborative installation, Broken Spectre, at 180 the Strand in London. Frost premiered two new sound installations in 2023, Enduring Amazon at the Momentary in Arkansas and The Predatory Chord at the Megaron in Athens.

Collaborations
In 2005, Frost remixed Björk's song ""Desired Constellation"", which was featured as the B-side to the ""Triumph of a Heart"" single. He engineered and played the keyboards on Tim Hecker's albums Ravedeath, 1972 and Virgins, which were recorded by Frost in Reykjavík. He was the mixing engineer on Colin Stetson's albums New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges and New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light. He was a recording engineer for A Winged Victory for the Sullen. Frost participated in the recording of the Swans albums The Seer, Leaving Meaning and The Beggar; he would also join as a touring member.

Bill Laswell,"William Otis Laswell (born February 12, 1955) is an American bass guitarist, record producer, and record label owner. He has been involved in thousands of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. His music draws from funk, world music, jazz, dub, and ambient styles.
According to music critic Chris Brazier, ""Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out."" Although his bands may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically. Material began as a noisy dance music band, but later albums concentrated on hip hop, jazz, or spoken word readings by William S. Burroughs. Most versions of the band Praxis have included guitarist Buckethead, but they have explored different permutations on albums.

Career
Early years
Laswell got his earliest professional experience as a bass guitarist in R&B and funk bands in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan. He saw shows that combined genres, such as Iggy and the Stooges, MC5, and Funkadelic. He was also influenced by jazz musicians John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Miles Davis.

New York and Material
In the late 1970s Laswell moved to New York City, immersing himself in the thriving New York music scene. He moved into producer Giorgio Gomelsky's loft and became part of a group of musicians that would become the first version of Material. Material became the backing band for Daevid Allen and New York Gong. The band consisted of Laswell, keyboardist Michael Beinhorn, and drummer Fred Maher. They were usually supplemented by guitarists Cliff Cultreri or Robert Quine.
He worked with Brian Eno, Fred Frith, John Zorn, Daniel Ponce, Ginger Baker, Peter Brötzmann, Kip Hanrahan, Sonny Sharrock, and with musicians in no wave, a genre that combined avant-garde jazz, funk, and punk.
He started a recording studio with Martin Bisi and met Jean Karakos, owner of Celluloid Records. Under the Material name Laswell became the de facto house producer for Celluloid until the label was sold in the 1980s. He recorded music that was experimental, combining jazz, funk, pop, and R&B, by musicians such as Whitney Houston, Sonny Sharrock, Archie Shepp, Henry Threadgill, and the band Massacre with Fred Frith and Fred Maher. His association with Celluloid allowed his first forays into ""collision music"", a term coined by British writer Chris May of Black Music & Jazz Review. Recordings with the Golden Palominos and production on albums by Shango, Toure Kunda, and Fela Kuti appeared on the label. Celluloid was an early advocate of hip hop, producing albums by Fab 5 Freddy, GrandMixer D.ST, Phase II, and Afrika Bambaataa. The album World Destruction paired John Lydon with Afrika Bambaataa years before Aerosmith and Run–D.M.C. collaborated on their rock/hip hop version of ""Walk This Way"".
In 1982, Laswell released Baselines, his solo debut album. A year later, he had a breakthrough with ""Rockit"", a song he co-wrote and produced for Herbie Hancock's album Future Shock. He played bass guitar and co-wrote other songs on the album, leading to collaborations with Hancock through the 2000s. He won a Grammy Award for producing Hancock's next album, Sound-System.
He became a member of the band Last Exit in 1986 with Peter Brötzmann, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Sonny Sharrock. Aside from one album that Laswell cobbled together in the studio, the band was primarily a live one, showing up at gigs with no rehearsal. The first time the four members played together was on stage at their first show.
Laswell produced albums for Sly and Robbie, Mick Jagger, PiL, Motörhead, Ramones, Stevie Salas, Iggy Pop and Yoko Ono. Many of these bands afforded Laswell the opportunity to hire his working crew to record on more mainstream records. Sly and Robbie hired him to produce their 1985 album Language Barrier and 1987 album Rhythm Killers.

Running Axiom
Island Records founder Chris Blackwell gave him the opportunity to begin a label in 1990, thus forming Axiom Records. In addition to albums by Material that included Sly and Robbie, William S. Burroughs, Bootsy Collins, Wayne Shorter, and Bernie Worrell, he produced and released albums by Ginger Baker, Ronald Shannon Jackson, Sonny Sharrock, Nicky Skopelitis, and Umar Bin Hassan. Among the studio-based albums, Palestinian oud and violinist Simon Shaheen recorded an album of music by Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Gambian virtuoso Foday Musa Suso recorded an album of dance music with his electric Kora, and Turkish saz master Talip Oezkan recorded an album. Master Musicians of Jajouka recorded an album in their village in the Rif Mountains. There were albums by Mandinka and Fulani recorded at Suso's family compound in Gambia and Gnawa music from Morocco.
Praxis featured guitarist Buckethead on Transmutation with Bootsy Collins, Bryan Mantia, Bernie Worrell, and Afrika Baby Bam from the Jungle Brothers. The album blended funk grooves and heavy metal riffs with many tracks co-written by Laswell.
Funkcronomicon included previously released tracks by Praxis and Skopelitis and tracks with members of Parliament-Funkadelic. George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and the last recordings of Eddie Hazel are featured prominently. The album includes DXT, Umar Bin Hassan, Abiodun Oyewole and Torture. Laswell remixed the Axiom catalog for Axiom Ambient, blending seemingly disparate tracks, releasing some of the music for Sample Material – International Free Zone, a sample library for other musicians to use as material.

Other labels
Subharmonic, conceived by Laswell and ex-Celluloid A&R Robert Soares, though not owned by Laswell, was essentially a vehicle for his projects, most in the ambient or ambient-dub categories. The label licensed a few releases from European labels for American re-release, notably Psychonavigation with Pete Namlook and Cymatic Scan with Tetsu Inoue from Pete Namlook's FAX label; Somnific Flux with Mick Harris and Cold Summer by Lull from the Sentrax label. Other collaborators included Jonah Sharp and Terre Thaemlitz. The label also released albums by Painkiller, Praxis, and Divination, an ambient dub project by Laswell. A sub-label called Strata was created with five releases in a more experimental dub/noise/ambient vein. Each of these releases (Death Cube K, Cypher 7, Azonic, and two under his alias Automaton) came in a black jewel case with the name of the project and album title printed on the front.
Three other short-lived labels were created after the demise of the Subharmonic deal. One was Meta, which was intended to be a spoken word label. The second label, Submeta, managed four releases before folding. Meta, formed with Janet Rienstra, released only one album, Baptism of Solitude with novelist Paul Bowles reading excerpts from his work over soundscapes by Laswell. Meta would appear periodically, distributed by other labels, over the next few years until it returned as a spiritual/yogic label run by Rienstra. The third label, Black Arc, was an associated label of Rykodisc focusing on ""Black Rock, Cyber Funk, and Future Blues"", according to a sampler. The label featured members of P-Funk on most of the albums and released albums by Bootsy Collins (under the name ""Zillatron""), Bernie Worrell (Japan-only), Mutiny (Jerome Brailey), and Billy Bass.
Charged (1999) by Eraldo Bernocchi and Toshinori Kondo was released by Laswell's label Innerythmic. After a brief inactive period, the label restarted in 2001, releasing over the next few years and albums by Nicky Skopelitis, Raoul Björkenheim, James Blood Ulmer, Shin Terai, and Gonervill. Innerhythmic also released a live recording by Praxis and reissued Black Arc albums from the 1990, including Zillatron, The Last Poets' Holy Terror and Buddy Miles' Hell & Back.
Laswell moved his studio to West Orange, New Jersey and called it Orange Music Sound Studios. Under Palm's umbrella, though, four albums and a DVD set were released, including a studio album and a live 2-disc set from Tabla Beat Science centered on tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain, son of Alla Rakha. The album included Karsh Kale, Trilok Gurtu, Ustad Sultan Khan, and Talvin Singh. This group has performed in the US, Lebanon, and Japan. Laswell, Kale, Kahn, and Hussain are usually supplemented by other musicians, which have included Gigi, DJ Disk, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Sussan Deyhim, and artist Petulia Mattioli. In 2001 Life Space Death was released with Japanese trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, Laswell on bass, guitar, and keyboards, and words by the 14th Dalai Lama interviewed by Kondo. At the request of Blackwell, Laswell oversaw the debut album by Ethiopian singer Gigi for Palm Pictures with Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Laswell. He also produced Abyssinia Infinite and Gold & Wax.
Laswell has stated in interviews that he met with Miles Davis a number of times and discussed working together, but busy schedules kept them from arranging such a recording before Davis' death. He remixed some of Davis's music for Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969-1974 (Axiom, 1998).

New century, new labels
He signed a contract with Sanctuary Records that led to the creation of his label Nagual. He worked in the drum and bass genre, starting with Brutal Calling credited to Bill Laswell vs. Submerged that was released by Avant in 2004. He and Submerged worked together again on The Only Way to Go is Down (2006) under the name Method of Defiance. After this album, they assembled producers in drum and bass to collaborate with musicians from jazz. Evol Intent, Future Prophecies, and SPL recorded with Buckethead, Herbie Hancock, and Pharoah Sanders.
In 2010, Laswell created the label M.O.D. Technologies. Its first releases were the albums Jahbulon and Incunabula by Method of Defiance and Mesgana Ethiopia by Material with Gigi.
Along with live dates around the world with Massacre, Material, Method of Defiance, and Painkiller, Laswell travels to Japan every year for recordings and live dates, including with Tokyo Rotation.
In September 2017, Bill Laswell was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine.
In November 2018, he performed in Dave Douglas Uplift band at the London Jazz Festival.

Collaborators
Laswell works frequently with a small group of collaborators. These include bassists Jah Wobble, Jonas Hellborg, and Bootsy Collins; guitarists Buckethead and Nicky Skopelitis; keyboardists Jeff Bova and Bernie Worrell; percussionists Aïyb Dieng and Karsh Kale, and musicians from P-Funk. Robert Musso has been his chief engineer for over twenty years. Oz Fritz has occasionally filled the role. Fritz is usually Laswell's live engineer of choice, known for live mixing technique. Remixes have been done for Sting, Nine Inch Nails, Almamegretta, Scorn, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tori Amos. He has done much work for John Zorn's Tzadik Records.
In 2005, Laswell was invited to appear on the PBS series Soundstage. The show featured musicians he has played with over the years, including members of Praxis and Tabla Beat Science, Pharoah Sanders, Foday Musa Suso, Bootsy Collins, and Catfish Collins.
Laswell worked with Sony Creative Software on a box set loop library called The Bill Laswell Collection.
He has also worked with Eraldo Bernocchi and Mick Harris on a project called Equations of Eternity, which is an ambient music project started in 1995 by Eraldo. Since its members live in separate parts of the world (Mick Harris in England; Bill Laswell in the US; and Eraldo Bernocchi in Italy), the project has been predominantly studio-based, with its members recording music in their respective countries.

Biomusic,"Biomusic is a form of experimental music which deals with sounds created or performed by non-humans. The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body (singing or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition).
Biomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer.  Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example new-age music uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical soundscapes, and ambient music sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience.

Biophony
At the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK), ""The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes,"" composed by Bernie Krause and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, Richard Blackford, premiered, and was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This composition is the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time. Commissioned by the Alonzo King LINES Ballet, an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for Biophony, composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has since been performed worldwide.

Bird song
The incorporation of bird song in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer Olivier Messiaen who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his Catalogue d'oiseaux (""Birds catalogue""), piano (1956–58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, ""Chronochromie"".
In Western art music, recordings of bird songs have been used in numerous works. One of the first is Pines of Rome (1924) by Ottorino Respighi – the third movement includes the sound of a nightingale recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This use of recording technology was something that had never been done before, and it quickly generated discussion. A famous example of this technique can be found in Cantus Arcticus (1972) by the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara: subtitled Concerto for Birds and Orchestra this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland.
Birdsong also frequently features in popular music. Early examples include schlager singer Ulla Billquist’s När Svalorna Komma Och Bygga Sitt Bo (1932) and Tobourlika by rebetiko artists Stratos Pagioumtzis and Ioanna Georgakopoulou (1940). A nightingale can be heard on Pink Floyd's ""Cirrus Minor"" (More, 1969) or ""Grantchester Meadows"" (Ummagumma, 1969), tweeting birds on Laurie Anderson's  ""O Superman"" (1981), seagulls in Léo Ferré‘s L'Opéra du pauvre (1983). Thanks to its inclusion as a preset in the E-mu Emulator II, a specific sample of a loon, notably heard in Sueño Latino (1989) and in 808 State’s Pacific State (1989), has become a recurring motif in electronic-based popular music.
The entire biophony of a soundscape can be heard on the Beaver & Krause 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), ""In a Wild Sanctuary"", one of the first notable ecology-themed popular albums and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration.
It is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or 0.007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms – those considered to be ""musical"" at any given time.

Whale song in music
Recorded whale song also frequently inspired 20th century experimental music. One example is in George Crumb's Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano. However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is And God Created Great Whales, a piece written in 1970 by American composer Alan Hovhaness. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of humpback, bowhead, and killer whales directly into the concert hall. The song ""Il n'y a plus rien"", from French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré's eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the Earth Mass (Missa Gaia) by Paul Winter (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work.

Neurofeedback
Music created by neurofeedback relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An Electroencephalophone (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by Erkki Kurenniemi in the 1960s. American composer David Rosenboom further pioneered work with neurofeedback music as has Brazilian composer Eduardo Reck Miranda. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed.

Cybernetic biomusic
In 1975, Grateful Dead associate Ned Lagin released an album of experimental space music entitled Seastones on Round Records; he described the recording as ""cybernetic biomusic"", emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings.  The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the Buchla digital-polyphonic synthesizer.
From 2004 to 2007, Pete Townshend collaborated with composer Lawrence Ball and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called The Lifehouse Method, an Internet site where applicants could ""sit"" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website.  On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on iTunes called Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project.

Other examples
Biomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: music scores created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance).
Music from The Body is the biomusic soundtrack album to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film The Body, about human biology, narrated by Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Finlay. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between Pink Floyd member Roger Waters and Ron Geesin, and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments.
The experimental ambient/noise group Tribes of Neurot released an album titled Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized.
A collaboration album between Breakcore artists Venetian Snares and Hecate entitled Nymphomatriarch was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time-stretched to resemble typical Breakcore samples.
The Lake, by artist Julie Freeman tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation.
Musicians Caninus, Hatebeak and Lil B have used animals as lead or backing vocalists.
""Field recorder"" Stuart Hyatt has used sounds created by bats which were then combined with music.

Jenssen was born on 30 May 1962 in Tromsø, a city within the Arctic Circle in the northernmost portion of Norway. He was inspired by the music of artists such as New Order, Depeche Mode, Wire, and Brian Eno, which he described as ""like discovering a new universe—a universe which I wanted to be a part of"". In 1983, he bought his first synthesizer and composed his first piece of music, taking influence from his archaeological studies, later stating ""Studying the Ice Age and Stone Age has definitely influenced my music."" In 1984 Jenssen issued his first album, ""E-Man"", released on cassette only on the Norwegian indie label Likvider and credited to E-man.
In 1985, Jenssen was part of the newly created Norwegian moody synth trio Bel Canto with Nils Johansen and singer Anneli Drecker. The band signed with Belgian label Crammed Discs and to Nettwerk in North America, and relocated to Brussels. Jenssen, however, soon returned to Tromsø, collaborating with the other band members by post, and continuing with his solo work. Bel Canto released two albums while Jenssen was a member, White-Out Conditions and Birds of Passage. In 1990, he left the band in order to pursue a different music style altogether, and began using a sampler.
Throughout the late 1980s, Jenssen used the moniker Bleep, under which he produced various 12"" records, now releasing records via the Crammed Discs subsidiary SSR. His early influences were from acid house and New Beat music. Released in 1990, The North Pole by Submarine was the only album recorded as Bleep. Further singles followed in 1990 and 1991 before Jenssen abandoned the Bleep moniker and again changed musical direction.

As Biosphere (1991–present)
Following the release of The North Pole by Submarine, Jenssen began releasing his music as Biosphere on obscure Norwegian compilation albums. His first Biosphere releases were the 12-inch single ""The Fairy Tale"" and the album Microgravity, both of which were rejected by SSR as unmarketable. Microgravity was released in 1991 on the Norwegian label Origo Sound, and saw wider release via the R&S Records subsidiary Apollo in 1992, to much critical acclaim. In 1992, Jenssen contributed ""I'll Strangle You"" to Hector Zazou's Sahara Blue project. In 1993, Jenssen collaborated with German ambient musician Pete Namlook on The Fires of Ork.
In 1994, the second Biosphere album, Patashnik was released, through which Jenssen continued to explore his ambient-house stylings to an even greater extent, employing the theme of a lost cosmonaut drifting aimlessly through space. Patashnik contained the first hints of the reduction in beat-driven song structure that would mark later Biosphere releases. Unlike the first album, Patashnik was quickly picked up by a comparatively large international audience, which brought Biosphere greater recognition. Jenssen also recorded as Cosmic Explorer, scoring a hit in Belgium with the EP The Hubble.
In 1995, Levi Strauss & Co. was searching for a new angle to add to their television advertisement campaign (which up to that point had never featured electronic music), and they decided to use the uptempo track ""Novelty Waves"" from Patashnik. Shortly thereafter, ""Novelty Waves"" was released as a single (featuring remixes by various other artists), and managed to chart in several countries, reaching #51 in the United Kingdom. Although Jenssen never regretted his approval for use of the track, he also never sought this kind of fame and subsequently turned down various requests by his record company and peers to collaborate with well-known techno and drum 'n bass artists or to create a follow-up album in the same style.  During that same year, Biosphere contributed the song ""The Seal and the Hydrophone"" exclusively to Apollo 2 – The Divine Compilation released by Apollo Records.
Substrata (1997) is a purely atmospheric ambient Biosphere album, released on All Saints Records. Substrata, which marked Jenssen's embarkation towards an intensely minimal style, is not only often considered to be Jenssen's best work to date, but is also seen as one of the all-time classic ambient albums. Substrata contains samples from the American TV show Twin Peaks.
In 2000, Jenssen released Cirque on his new home Touch, an ambient album driven by muffled beats, samples, and minimal atmospherics. Though Cirque briefly revisited territory covered by earlier Biosphere releases, the rhythm section throughout the album remains an element of the background, unlike Jenssen's first two Biosphere releases, wherein the drums occupied a dominating proportion of the foreground.
In 2002, he released Shenzhou, the fifth full-length album under the name Biosphere. This album was a more abstract work, comparable to Aphex Twin's 1994 album Selected Ambient Works Volume II. The material on the album draws from elongated, pitch-shifted loops taken from Debussy's La Mer (The Sea),  and Jeux.
Released in 2004, Autour de la Lune stands as the most minimal and austere Biosphere album to date. The drones employed on this album are comparable to Coil's 1998 album Time Machines in their timbre and slow rate of change. The bulk of this work was originally commissioned and broadcast in September 2003 by Radio France Culture for a musical evocation of Jules Verne.
In 2006, Jenssen released Dropsonde, a half beatless, half rhythmic album composed of jazz rhythms evocative of Miles Davis' 1970s jazz fusion works.  A partial vinyl sampler was released a few months earlier in 2005.
In 2009, Biosphere issued Wireless: Live at the Arnolfini, Bristol, his first live album, containing new tracks such as ""Pneuma"" and ""Pneuma II"".
Jenssen has scored a number of films, including Eternal Stars (1993) and Insomnia (1997). He collaborated with German ambient composer Pete Namlook on Fires of Ork, and has also worked with Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart and with Bobby Bird of Higher Intelligence Agency. In 2010, two soundtracks were announced on Biosphere's website, for German film ""Im Schatten"" and Norwegian ""NOKAS"".
On 27 June 2011, Geir Jenssen released the album N-Plants, inspired by nuclear energy and nuclear plants in Japan.
In 2016, Jenssen released Departed Glories as Biosphere. The thematic focus of the album draws inspiration from the defence of Kraków from Nazi invasion during the Second World War. Jenssen conceived of the album while living in the city.
On 5 February 2021, Jenssen released the electronic-classical album Angel's Flight which features twelve tracks based on Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14.
In January 2022, Jenssen released Shortwave Memories as Biosphere. The album marked a sonic departure from Jenssen's previous work - using manually-programmed analogue synthesizers from the late 70s and early 80s to create a more vintage sound.
On 14 October 2022, Jenssen released Substrata (Alternative Versions) on Biophon Records, featuring ten alternative versions picked from the Substrata recording sessions that took place between 1995 and 1996.

Live
Biosphere regularly performs live during electronic music festivals and in clubs throughout Europe and various other locales around the world. Live performances usually consist of Jenssen performing improvisations or variations on newer tracks on a laptop while video art is projected behind him; for example, full-screen video art was projected in his Picturehouse cinema tour in April 2006. Although these performances are rarely tied specifically to a recent album release, the uptempo material from the Bleep and Microgravity/Patashnik era is occasionally featured in Biosphere performances.
In May 2004, Biosphere's first United States performance took place in Detroit.
In 2008 Jenssen announced a year-long break from touring due to his reported hatred of ""airports, security checks, unhealthy food, air conditioning, hotels, etc."".  However he resumed concert activity in 2009 and 2011.

Other interests
Jenssen is also an active climber and mountaineer. This hobby is an inspiration on his work, as well as a source of natural sound samples. His highest feat was in 2001, climbing the Cho Oyu (Himalaya, 8201 meters) without oxygen; in 2006, he thus released Cho Oyu 8201m – Field Recordings from Tibet (as Geir Jenssen).

In October 2005, Tobias Wilner released an album with his side project, Bichi. The title of the album is Notwithstanding, and is released by Thomas Knak on his label, Hobby Industries. Some of the Bichi work would later turn into Blue Foundation songs. The Blue Foundation song, This is Goodbye, from the movie Manslaughter, was originally the instrumental song Revolve In The Sun/My Footfalls Are Superfluous, from the album Notwithstanding. Also, the Bichi song It Begins, featured in the movie Waking Madison, by Katherine Brooks, was re-recorded and later released as a Blue Foundation version.

On 1 February 2009 Tobias Wilner established DPC Records, mainly to release Blue Foundation, Bichi and his band Ghost Society. Later that year Blue Foundation went double platinum in USA for the Twilight Soundtrack. The album was certified double platinum on 16 April 2009.

Boards of Canada,"Boards of Canada are a Scottish electronic music duo consisting of the brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin, formed initially as a group in 1986 before becoming a duo in the 1990s. Signing first to Skam followed by Warp Records in the 1990s, the duo received recognition following the release of their debut album Music Has the Right to Children on Warp in 1998. They followed with the critically acclaimed albums Geogaddi (2002), The Campfire Headphase (2005) and Tomorrow's Harvest (2013).
The duo's work, largely influenced by outdated media and electronic music from the 1970s, incorporates vintage synthesiser tones, samples, analog equipment, and hip hop-inspired beats. It has been described by critics as exploring themes related to nostalgia, as well as childhood memory, science, environmental concerns and esoteric subjects. In 2012, Fact described them as ""one of the best-known and best-loved electronic acts of the last two decades.""

History
Early years (1986–1994)
Brothers Michael Sandison (born Michael Peter Sandison, 14 July 1971) and Marcus Eoin (born Marcus Eoin Sandison, 27 May 1973) were brought up in Cullen, Moray, on the northeast coast of Scotland. From 1979 to 1980, they lived in Calgary, Canada, while their father, who worked in construction, took part in the project to build the Saddledome. The brothers attended the University of Edinburgh, where Michael studied music and Marcus studied artificial intelligence. Marcus dropped out before completing his degree. The duo did not reveal that they are brothers until a 2005 interview with Pitchfork, as they wanted to avoid comparisons with another electronic sibling duo, Orbital.
Growing up in a musical family, the brothers first played instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques from around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands. However, it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to join Mike's band that Boards of Canada was born. The band's name was inspired by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), the government agency whose award-winning documentary films and animation they had watched as children.
Their first known release was Catalog 3, in 1987 on cassette tape, on the brothers' own label, Music70, while Boards of Canada was still a band (it was later re-pressed in 1997 on CD on the same label). By 1989, the band had been reduced to Mike and Marcus, and they released Acid Memories in the same year. Both albums have only been heard by the band's friends and family, except for a 24-second excerpt of ""Duffy"", released on the EHX website in the late 1990s. Acid Memories is the only early album the brothers have mentioned in interviews. Later, in the early 1990s, the band had a number of collaborations and the band put on small shows among the Hexagon Sun collective, along with the releases of albums Play By Numbers and Hooper Bay, both in 1994, which, similarly to Acid Memories, were only released to friends and family and had sub-1 minute excerpts of two songs (""Wouldn't You Like To Be Free"" from Play By Numbers and ""Circle"" from Hooper Bay) released from both albums on the EHX website.

Music Has the Right to Children (1995–2002)
In 1995, Boards of Canada made their first Hexagon Sun studio release, the EP Twoism. Like earlier Music70 releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases, however, a small number of copies were also released to the public through a mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of sufficient quality and worth to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002.
The band made another release in 1996, titled Boc Maxima; it was a semi-private release that was notable for being a full-length album, and was the precursor to Music Has the Right to Children, with which it shares many tracks.
Boards of Canada's first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of Autechre's Sean Booth, of the English label Skam Records, one of many people who were sent a demo EP. Skam issued what was considered Boards of Canada's first ""findable"" work, Hi Scores, in 1996.
The debut studio album, Music Has the Right to Children, was released in April 1998. The album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also includes one of the duo's most popular songs, ""Roygbiv"". Music Has the Right to Children received widespread acclaim upon release. It featured at No. 35 on Pitchfork's ""Top 100 Albums of the 1990s"" list. It was ranked No. 91 in Mojo's 100 Modern Classics list.
John Peel featured Boards of Canada on his BBC Radio 1 programme in July of that year. The session featured two remixes from Music Has the Right to Children — ""Aquarius (Version 3)"" and ""Olson (Version 3)"" — along with the tracks ""Happy Cycling"" and ""XYZ"". ""XYZ"" was excluded from the Peel Session TX 21/07/1998 release until 2019.
Though never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp labelmates Seefeel and Autechre in a handful of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills including two Warp parties: Warp's 10th Anniversary Party in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the Tortoise-curated All Tomorrow's Parties. They have not performed a live show since.
The band released a four-track EP, In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country, in November 2000, their first original release in two years. The 12"" edition was pressed on sky blue vinyl.

Geogaddi and The Campfire Headphase (2002–2009)
Their second studio album, Geogaddi, was released in February 2002. Like Music Has the Right to Children, this album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also presents a darker sound than its predecessor. Geogaddi received universal acclaim from music critics.
It was described by Sandison as ""a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.""
Their third album for Warp Records, The Campfire Headphase, was released on 17 October 2005 in Europe and 18 October 2005 in the United States. The album featured fifteen tracks, including ""Peacock Tail"", ""Chromakey Dreamcoat,"" and ""Dayvan Cowboy"". Two versions of ""Dayvan Cowboy"" — the original and a remix by Odd Nosdam — are on the six-track EP, Trans Canada Highway, which was released on 26 May 2006.
In late 2009, the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation featured two BoC covers, one by Bibio of their song ""Kaini Industries"" and one by Mira Calix of ""In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country"". Warp20 (Recreated) is part of the larger Warp20 boxed set, which also includes two previously unreleased Boards of Canada tracks, ""Seven Forty Seven"" and a 1.8 second sample of the song ""Spiro"", which had previously been performed at their show at the Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party in 2000.

Tomorrow's Harvest (2013)
On Record Store Day 2013, a vinyl record containing a short clip of music which was believed to be the work of Boards of Canada surfaced at the New York record store Other Music. Shortly after the release, Warp Records vouched for the record's authenticity. The record (titled ------/------/------/XXXXXX/------/------) contained a short clip of audio followed by a voice reading six digits similar to that of a numbers station. The record revealed what was to become one of six unique numbers that were part of a type of alternate reality game that was used to promote the release of their next studio album.
The rest of the codes were hidden through various websites and online communities, as well as being broadcast over BBC Radio One, NPR, and Adult Swim. After much speculation, the official website for the band redirected users to another website which asked for the user to enter a password. Once all six unique codes are entered, a video is shown announcing Tomorrow's Harvest, their fourth studio album. The album was released on 5 June 2013 in Japan, 10 June 2013 in Europe, and 11 June 2013 in the United States to widespread critical acclaim.

Remixes
In 2016, Boards of Canada released two remixes. The first, of Nevermen's ""Mr Mistake"", was released on 12 January, and was followed shortly after by a remix of ""Sisters"" by Odd Nosdam on 22 February. On 17 February 2017, an instrumental version of the ""Mr Mistake"" remix was released. In 2017 Boards of Canada released a remix of ""Sometimes"" by The Sexual Objects. On July 3, 2021, Boards of Canada released a remix of a second Nevermen song, ""Treat Em Right"".

WXAXRXP (2019)
In 2019, Warp Records kicked off the celebrations for their 30th anniversary, entitled WXAXRXP, with a 100-hour takeover of online radio station NTS Radio, featuring mixes, radio shows and unreleased music from a number of artists on their roster. This included a 2-hour mixtape from Boards of Canada titled Societas x Tape, aired on 23 June 2019 at 9:00 PM BST, and featured music from other artists such as Grace Jones, Devo and Yellow Magic Orchestra, spliced with spoken word samples and music that is rumoured to be unreleased work from the group itself.

Style and methods
The music of Boards of Canada has been described as ""evocative, mournful, sample-laden downtempo music often sounding as though produced on malfunctioning equipment excavated from the ruins of an early-'70s computer lab."" Critic Simon Reynolds described their style as ""a hazy sound of smeared synth-tones and analog-decayed production, carried by patient, sleepwalking beats, and aching with nostalgia"" while crediting them with ""reinvent[ing]"" elements of psychedelia through the deliberate misuse of technology. Their distinctive style is a product of their use of analogue equipment, mix of electronic and conventional instrumentation, use of distorted samples, and their layering and blending of these elements. To achieve their evocative and ""worn down"" sound, the duo have made use of outdated brands of recording equipment, such as tape machines manufactured by Grundig. They also make use of samples from 1970s television shows and other media prevalent in the era of the brothers' shared childhood, especially the nature-inspired documentaries produced by the National Film Board of Canada. The duo's preoccupation with memory, past aesthetics, and public broadcasting presaged the 2000s electronic movement known as hauntology. Critic Adam Harper described their work as ""a simultaneously Arcadian and sinister musical hauntology based on cut-up samples, vintage synthesiser technology and a faded modernism arising from mid-twentieth-century television, science, public education, childhood and spirituality.""
Interviews with the Sandison brothers have variously provided insight into their creative process: they have cited several acts that have influenced their work including Joni Mitchell, the Incredible String Band (saying ""we have all the String Band records […] our rural sensibilities are similar""), the Beatles (saying ""[they] really became enthralling to us through their psychedelism"") and My Bloody Valentine (saying ""even if we don't sound like them, there's a connection in terms of the approach to music""). They have also named Meat Beat Manifesto as a chief influence, citing their synth sounds.
Brief interludes or vignettes feature prominently in the duo's music, often lasting less than two minutes; Sandison has said that ""we write far more of [these] than the so-called 'full-on' tracks, and, in a way, they are our own favourites"". Boards of Canada have written an enormous number of such fragments as well as full-length tracks, most of which have been held back from release, and it does not appear that their music is made exclusively for commercial release; rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work. For instance, Geogaddi allegedly involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 22 were selected (possibly 23, if the final track of complete silence is included). Eoin has said about the duo's discography that ""the idea of the perfect album is this amorphous thing that we're always aiming at […] the whole point of making music is at least to aim at your own idea of perfection.""
The duo have expressed interest in themes of subliminal messaging, and subsequently their work has incorporated cryptic messages, including references to numerology and cult figures such as David Koresh of the Branch Davidians. When questioned about their aims in making such references, Boards of Canada have expressed themselves in neutral terms (saying ""We're not religious at all [...] and if we're spiritual at all it's purely in the sense of caring about art and inspiring people with ideas."") while remaining fascinated with the ability of music to influence the minds of others (saying, with irony, that ""[We] do actually believe that there are powers in music that are almost supernatural. I think you actually manipulate people with music..."").

Bonobo (musician),"Simon Green (born 30 March 1976), known by his stage name Bonobo, is an English musician, producer, and DJ based in Los Angeles. He debuted with a trip hop aesthetic and has since explored more upbeat approaches as well as jazz and world music influences. His electronic sound incorporates the use of organic instrumentation and is recreated by a full band in live performances.

Career
1999–2009
Green debuted in 1999 on the Tru Thoughts compilation When Shapes Join Together. His stage name Bonobo is a reference to the great ape species. Following the release of the EP Scuba, on the Brighton-based label Fly Casual Recordings, and the single ""Terrapin"", Bonobo was offered label deals with XL Recordings and Mute Records, but he chose to remain with Tru Thoughts.
His first album, Animal Magic, was published on the same label in 2000, to mixed reviews. Paul Cooper of Pitchfork stated that it ""breaks no new ground for chill-out"", while PopMatters said Bonobo ""[showcases] smooth breakbeat loops, synth sounds, and aforementioned dub effects. [And his] electronic music draws on live playing."" Reviewer Dean Carlson also said that the album ""slowly takes shape as a solid debut of narcoleptic downtempo"". In spite of these reactions, Animal Magic has gained Bonobo a cult following. Its accompanying compilation album, titled ""One Offs..."", was issued in 2002 and contains reworked songs and rarities.
In 2001, Bonobo was signed to Coldcut's label Ninja Tune, and in 2003, he released Dial 'M' for Monkey. John Bush of AllMusic stated in a review that Bonobo's influences were drawn more towards alternative rock and world music rather than hip hop or trip hop. The album tracks ""Pick up"" and ""Flutter"" were featured in the snowboarding game SSX on Tour.
In 2005, Bonobo contributed to the Solid Steel series with It Came from the Sea. The mix features several exclusive tracks as well as remixes and re-edits. His third album, entitled Days to Come, was released on 2 October 2006. An AllMusic review states that ""[Bonobo] breathes new life into a well-worn genre."" With the album as well as his future work, he featured vocalists such as Bajka, thus ""adding [an] organic and vibrant musicality that's rare in electronic music."" Days to Come was voted Best Album of 2006 by Gilles Peterson's listeners. The song ""Nightlite"" appeared on UEFA Champions League 2006–2007, and ""Recurring"" was used in a surfing film broadcast on Fuel TV.

2010–2015
The song ""The Keeper"", featuring vocals by Andreya Triana, was issued in September 2009 as the lead single from Bonobo's fourth album, Black Sands, released in March 2010. A BBC review by Paul Clarke stated that ""Green has progressed from predominantly sample-based production to more live instrumentation [and] has become equally adept at mastering [...] multi-layered atmospheres."" In the same review, Clarke also commented that the song ""We Could Forever"" ""saddles an Afro-inflected guitar and skittish flute to deep sub-bass"" and ""Kiara"" combines ""oriental strings with cut-up beats"". After their collaboration for Black Sands, Green produced Triana's debut album, Lost Where I Belong. The Bonobo song ""Kong"" was used during a scene in an artist's studio in the eighth episode of the second season of House of Cards.
In February 2012, Black Sands Remixed was released on Ninja Tune, featuring tracks from the original Black Sands record remixed by electronic producers such as Machinedrum, Lapalux, Floating Points, and Mark Pritchard.
The first single off the next Bonobo album, ""Cirrus"", was given its worldwide debut on Gilles Peterson's BBC Radio 6 program on 19 January 2013. The album, titled The North Borders, was set for release on 1 April 2013 but came out early in its digital format after a promotional copy was leaked prior to the planned launch date. The North Borders marked Bonobo's first UK and US album chart entries, where they respectively reached numbers 34 and 122. ""Cirrus"" was featured as the closing song of the pilot episode for the AMC show Halt and Catch Fire.
Bonobo produced the song ""Pulls"" by DELS for his 2014 album, Petals Have Fallen, which was released under Big Dada—a sister label of Ninja Tune.

2016–present
Bonobo released his sixth album, Migration, in January 2017. In an interview with Billboard, he stated that he conceived the album from ""living and being in various locations"", as he toured extensively and did not ""have a home base for about a year"". The album and the track ""Bambro Koyo Ganda"" were nominated at the 2018 Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively. The record peaked at number 5 on the UK chart and 59 in the US. In 2018, it won Album of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards, and the artist was nominated for Live Act of the Year.
On 1 July 2019, Bonobo released a new song, ""Linked"", online. The track was later nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 62nd Grammy Awards but lost to ""Got to Keep On"" by the Chemical Brothers.
The following year, Bonobo remixed Michael Kiwanuka's song ""Final Days"".
Bonobo's seventh studio album, Fragments, was released on 14 January 2022, with five singles issued ahead of its release. The first one, ""Rosewood"", debuted on 6 October 2021, followed by ""Tides""—a collaboration with Jamila Woods—on 20 October. ""Otomo""—a collaboration with O'Flynn—came out on 10 November, followed by ""Shadows"", with Jordan Rakei, on 1 December. The fifth and final single, ""From You"", with Joji, was released on 3 January 2022.
Bonobo was nominated for the Brit Award for British Dance Act in 2023.
Bonobo is set to produce music for the upcoming Japanese anime television series Lazarus, directed by Shinichirō Watanabe.

Musical style
Bonobo's sound is oriented on beats and samples but typically ""soothing"", combining influences ranging from club to world music. Pitchfork named him a key figure in the 2000s downtempo electronica scene, while The Guardian associated him with the recent popularity of ""ambient world electronica"". While his earliest work was firmly based in trip hop, his style soon became more upbeat and delved into genres such as jazz (which has led him to be described as a nu jazz artist) and traditional Indian music. He has collaborated with various artists, including Bajka, Andreya Triana, Erykah Badu, and Rhye, who have contributed vocals to songs on several of his albums.
Green has also performed with Robert Luis of the Tru Thoughts label under the aliases Nirobi and Barakas.
Whilst often touring solo and performing DJ sets and residencies, in 2010, Bonobo opted to start touring with a full band for the Black Sands tour. The group plays live renditions of studio material, with a singer, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist, string section, electronics, and drummer, often with improvisations and solos.

Bradley Joseph,"Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from ""quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth"".
Active since 1983, Joseph has performed in front of half a million people around the world. He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the Midwest until 1989 when Greek composer Yanni hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours, most recently in 2003 for the 60-city Ethnicity tour. He appears in the multi-platinum album and concert film, Live at the Acropolis. Joseph also spent five years as musical director and lead keyboardist for Sheena Easton, including a 1995 performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
Joseph is the founder of the Robbins Island Music label. His solo career began when he independently released Hear the Masses, featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut was followed by Rapture, an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the Narada label and reached ZMR Airwaves Top 30. A number of subsequent recordings including Christmas Around the World and One Deep Breath also held positions on ZMR's Top 100 radio chart, with the most recent being Paint the Sky which debuted at #15 in April 2013. Paint the Sky was nominated for Best Neo-Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards. He has produced numerous CDs/DVDs and piano books. His music is included in multiple various-artist compilation albums including the 2008 release of The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II.

Biography
Early years
Bradley Joseph was born in Bird Island, Minnesota and raised in Willmar, Minnesota, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983. He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. One morning his father taught him how to play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. He started playing classical piano at age eight, taking lessons for a year and a half but was self-taught thereafter. While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform. He recalls, ""I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared."" Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram.

Yanni
In 1989, Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer Yanni, who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist John Tesh, as Tesh was launching his own solo career. When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired over the phone to join his core band, without ever meeting. 

When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni.
After moving to Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project. ""It was a real trial by fire for me"", said Joseph. ""First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS."" He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that ""It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas."" Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, Live at the Acropolis. He recounts, ""When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show. People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives.""
In the band, Joseph covered a lot of the keyboard parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a ""full-bodied, live-effect sound"". He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. Joseph said that ""Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input."" He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.
Between tours, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from RCA, Epic, Warner Brothers, and Polygram Records, in addition to performing in an elaborate national keyboard show tour with various musicians. In 2003, he returned for the 60-city Ethnicity tour.

Sheena Easton
Joseph also performed with Sheena Easton for four years as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist. He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years. ""It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again"", he said in reference to Easton's R&B style. ""I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention.""

Working with Easton was ""...a shock in musical styles but a welcome change."" Wheeler questioned how he got hooked up with Easton; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, and then they cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut. Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all the three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.
In a 1995 interview, he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break. Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule. Working with Easton, on the other hand, was ""the best of both worlds"". ""She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in"", said Joseph. Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States, as well as routine appearances in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. In March 1995, he appeared with her on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno when she performed her new single at the time, ""My Cherie"".

Solo career
More Core Records
In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, Hear the Masses, a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions. He invited most of the Yanni band to contribute.

Narada
Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some playing three or more different instruments, that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth. 
Joseph's style attracted the attention of Narada Productions, a Virgin Records subsidiary, via the World Wide Web. A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music. This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi-record deal, according to Peter Spellman of the Berklee College of Music. The outcome was Rapture, containing intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestral works. It reached ZMR's ""Airwaves Top 30"" at No. 15 in July 1997. This album was recorded at a number of different studios including Captain and Tennille's studio in Los Angeles, and Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. In addition to a core band including Charlie Adams on percussion, Charlie Bisharat on violin, and Steven Trochlil on clarinet, Joseph brought in a 50-piece orchestra, and conducted and wrote all the scores. Ken Moore of the Naples Daily News cites, ""Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some playing three or more different instruments, that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth."" Wind and Wire Magazine contributor, Michael Debbage, recalls, ""It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels – Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave – were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album Rapture to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his tour de force.""

Robbins Island Music
Although Joseph said that working with Narada was a great experience music-wise, he did not like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract. He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. Solo Journey was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody. It is characterized by Debbage as being a ""scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking"".

Later releases include Christmas Around the World reaching ZMR's Top 100 Radio Playlist; and One Deep Breath also holding a position on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart for over six months. Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces, as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music."" Reviewing for Allmusic, Jim Brenholts describes One Deep Breath as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds ""world music flair and inspirational touches"". ""The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly."" The special audiences and beautiful cities inspired me to compose after sound checks... What an inspiration it was for me to sit alone on stage in these grand arenas and compose music.
Joseph returned as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni's 2003 Ethnicity world tour, and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks. The Journey Continues, a sequel to Solo Journey, features Joseph on solo piano. Debbage writes, ""The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor.""
Subsequent releases include For the Love of It, Piano Love Songs, and Hymns and Spiritual Songs. On these albums, Joseph arranges piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" (Burt Bacharach), ""Fields of Gold"" (Sting), and ""Ave Maria"" (Schubert). He has produced numerous CD and DVD projects designed for pets in a Music Pets Love series. He has also produced a four-CD set of Nature Sounds and has published many of his compositions in sheet music form. His music is used throughout the DVD, Isle Royale Impressions Volume II, containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the Isle Royale National Park in Michigan.
In April 2013, Joseph released his first album of original compositions in 10 years entitled Paint the Sky which debuted at #15 on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart. It is self-described as ""piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel"". He received requests from listeners to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to Hear The Masses and Rapture. Kathy Parsons of MainlyPiano states that ""Joseph is obviously a very versatile musician, and there are a lot of influences and musical styles that meld together to make Paint the Sky an exceptional musical experience."" Michael Debbage of MainlyPiano writes that Paint the Sky represents Joseph’s most complete recording since his landmark album Rapture. He goes on to say that ""whether you have enjoyed Joseph’s more spatial recordings or his deeper embellished adventures, Paint the Sky essential is a musical rainbow of where Joseph has been and where he can potential go.""

Accolades and achievements
Joseph was named one of the ""Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans"" (TOYM) of 2004 by the Minnesota Jaycees. In April 2008 he was presented the ""WPS Foundation Arts and Academics Hallmarks of Pride"" award for outstanding achievements by an alumnus.
Joseph's music has been heard in regular rotation in the United States and Canada by more than 160 major radio networks including XM and Sirius satellite radio, DMX; in the United Kingdom including RTÉ lyric fm; as well as airwaves in Japan, Spain, China, South-East Asia, Thailand, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. Airlines such as Aeroméxico, AirTran, Frontier, and JetBlue feature his music in their in-flight music programs. The Weather Channel also utilizes his compositions during the ""Local on the 8s"" segments, and the song ""Friday's Child"" is included in their 2008 compilation release, The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II.
Paint the Sky (2013) was nominated for Best Neo-Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards.

Thoughts on success as an independent artist
Having experienced both avenues of recording on a major label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. ""I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions"", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. ""A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent."" ""I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine"", he said. ""It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players.""
In an interview with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed a great deal from when he was younger. He said, ""Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses."" But some artists just want to be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. He advises, ""...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."" He explains, ""Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for.""
When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world, Joseph replied, ""The first thing business people say is 'First and foremost, if you want to be successful, live where you want to live'."" He grew up there and family were important to him. When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.

Composition and musical style
On composing
The piano is always true to me. In times of despair, happiness, and joy, its mood is always my own.
In an interview with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, ""Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener."" This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. Then he would start ""building around it"", like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. ""In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time"", says Joseph.
Debbage comments, ""One strength of Bradley Joseph as an artist has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally"". Joseph explained to Janus that, ""Through instrumental music, I'm allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences."" He believes that ""music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words."" He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to ""find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you""...""Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music"", he says. Parsons goes on to say, ""The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own."" Yanni once said, ""Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift"". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component ""to be sensitive to what you see and to be able to apply that to music"".
Polta reports that he often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural Minnesota roots. ""Wind Farmer"" was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near Olivia, and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in Willmar.
Joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the Korg Triton music workstation, Korg SG-1 piano, and occasionally Korg M1. Rack units have included Roland JD-800, and Roland JV-1080 which he says is ""great for string layers"". The Alesis D4, Yamaha SY22, and Yamaha TG77 which has ""some nice ethereal textures"" have been utilized; working also with E-mu Systems Proteus 1, Proteus 2, and the E-5000 sampler because it is ""easy to use and has a great library"".

Musical style
Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time, having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994. ""When I write it, it just kind of moves, because where I am in life is different"", Joseph said. ""So as I get older, it kind of changes.""

Hear the Masses and Rapture
Joseph's recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in Hear the Masses and Rapture that combine smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes. A review of Rapture from New Age Voice states Joseph ""paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements"". ""The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on 'Be Still' signaling an introspective sort of mood; yet the strings swell on 'The Passage' engulfing the listener in an ocean of sound."" ""Even cuts that start quiet, such as 'Healing the Hollow Man' or 'Blue Rock Road' ebb and flow between quiet moments and crescendos.""

Solo Journey and The Journey Continues
In contrast, albums such as Solo Journey and The Journey Continues are considered to be ""stripped back and basic"" by Debbage, with the latter featuring ""Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter"". ""There is color in the songs via their understated melodies."" As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song ""The Road Ahead"". Solo Piano Publications contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, ""...'The Long, Last Mile' starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns.""

One Deep Breath
For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph combines ""structured melodic pieces and free-form ambient compositions"", which ""departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture"". Binkelman writes, ""It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between."" For instance, the song ""Dance of Life"" was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, ""Rusalka"". It is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. Then the album closes with its title track, ""One Deep Breath"", that ""floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds"". It is ""far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here"", and is ""stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before"".

Christmas Around the World and Classic Christmas
Debbage depicts ""A Minnesota Snowfall"" from Christmas Around the World as taking ""a more naked, bare-boned ballad approach"". While discussing Classic Christmas, Gerry Grzyb, chairman of the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh sociology department, states that Joseph's usual approach is to play the carol straight, and then add his own twists. ""... he's very effective at that—he doesn't stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might, but he does keep the interest up."" Grzyb says that the same applies to Joseph's earlier Christmas Around the World CD, which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds.

Suites & Sweets
Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra. The 2009 release of Suites & Sweets features compositions by Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and other classical composers. Joseph told Fredericksen that he, ""took the best parts and movements out of those classical songs … and made it soft and calm all the way through.""

Paint the Sky
After requests from listeners for Joseph to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to Hear The Masses and Rapture, Joseph released Paint the Sky in April 2013. It is self-described as ""piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel"". John P. Olsen of New Age Music World writes that ""Paint The Sky ...is best expressed by the near even number of songs with upbeat melodies and lively rhythms, with the balance centered by a light, casual relaxed atmosphere...with importance given to melodic rhythm and phrasing."" In another review of Paint the Sky, Bill Binkelman of Wind and Wire says that ""Joseph is one of the very best artists when it comes to crafting piano instrumentals augmented by the spot-on application of an assortment of keyboard embellishments, from standard orchestral accompaniment to more textural/new age elements"". Kathy Parsons of MainlyPiano states ""The thirteen pieces"" ...range from tender to majestic. Several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant, cinematic effect.""
About this album, Binkelman describes the song ""Inside the Stars"" as ""an uptempo, joyous lead piano melody accented by bouncy rhythms played on kit drums, thumping bass, and tambourine plus superlative orchestral strings"". Michael Debagge of MainlyPiano states that ""the optimism of this album is felt immediately courtesy of the buoyancy of 'Inside The Stars', filled with Joseph's nifty piano work more in the vein of Bruce Hornsby, then layered in strings and percussion work"".
In an in-depth analysis of the composition ""In Dreams Awake"", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of Philip Glass' music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song's finale. Parsons characterizes this same song as ""a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, ""floating effortlessly"" on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme"". At the same time, Debbage notes ""...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..."" and says that it ""...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams"".
Binkleman goes on to say that the song ""Into the Big Blue"" should instantly call Aaron Copland to mind – it has the same BIG orchestral/cinematic sound to it, along with Copland-esque western rhythm and melodic motifs. Similarly, Debbage states that this song brings to mind the musical opening theme of that old western television show The Big Valley.
In reference to the song ""Secrets of the Sun"", Binkelman describes ""lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with a dash of wistfulness besides"". The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. Parsons details this as ""much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements"". Debbage writes that ""the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph's uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.

Genres and radio formats
Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in the adult contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and beautiful music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. ""For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake."" ""The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream."" Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that there was much more that the New Age genre could offer. Cicily Janus remarks that, ""Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities.""

Brian Eno,"Brian Peter George Eno (; born 15 May 1948), also mononymously known as Eno, is an English musician, songwriter, record producer and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering contributions to ambient music and electronica, and for producing, recording, and writing works in rock and pop music. A self-described ""non-musician"", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.
Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid-1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined the glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971 and recorded two albums with them before departing in 1973. He then released a number of solo pop albums, beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974), and explored minimal music with the influential recordings Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term ""ambient music"".
Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp (as part of the duo Fripp & Eno), Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, and David Byrne. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums, and produce for other artists, most prominently U2, Coldplay and Peter Gabriel, and including Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn.
Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, his installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation. His modern political activism has also included Gazan tragedy awareness before and during the 2023-24 Gaza–Israel conflict, climate change awareness, anti-Toryism, and the freedom and release of Julian Assange.

Early life
Brian Peter George Eno was born on 15 May 1948 in the village of Melton, Suffolk, the son of William Arnold Eno (1916–1988), a postal worker and clock and watch repairer, and Maria Alphonsine (née Buslot; 1922–2005), a Belgian national. His grandfather was a multi-instrumentalist who played the saxophone and bassoon whilst he built and repaired pianos and church organs. Eno is the eldest of their three children; he has a brother, Roger, and sister Arlette. They have a half-sister, Rita, from their mother's previous relationship. The surname Eno is derived from the French Huguenot surname Hennot. Along with the rest of the family, in particular the parents, he was raised in the Catholic Christian faith.

I like melancholy and have never found it to be the same thing as moroseness or sadness. I've always enjoyed being melancholy, perhaps because that mood is very much a feature of the environment where I grew up. It's a very bleak place and most visitors find it quite miserable. I don't think it's miserable but it's definitely a sort of lost place in a lost time – nothing has changed in this part of England for many hundreds of years.
In 1959, Eno attended St Joseph's College in Ipswich, a Catholic grammar school of the De La Salle Brothers order. His confirmation name is taken from the founder of the De La Salle Brothers, Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, giving Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno. During this time, he had begun to listen to several records of American black R&B, blues and doo wop artists; he specifically cited the Lafayettes, Don and Juan, the Silhouettes and Little Richard as being key American musical figures within this period. He was also inspired by Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, who Eno had first discovered whilst staying with Carl Otto Eno, his uncle, at his residence where he would collect pieces of art.
By 1964, after earning four O-levels, including ones in art and maths, Eno had developed an interest in art and music and had no interest in a ""conventional job"". He enrolled at the Ipswich School of Art, taking on the newly established Groundcourse foundation art degree established by new media artist Roy Ascott. Here, one of Eno's teachers was artist Tom Phillips, who became a lifelong friend and encouraged his musical ability. Phillips recalled the pair doing ""piano tennis"" in which, after collecting pianos, the two stripped and aligned them in a hall and struck them with tennis balls. In 1966, Eno studied for a diploma in Fine Arts at the Winchester School of Art, from which he graduated in 1969. At Winchester Eno once attended a lecture by future Who guitarist Pete Townshend, also a former student of Ascott's; he cites this as the moment when he realised he could make music without formal training.
Whilst at school, Eno used a tape recorder as a musical instrument and in 1964 he joined his first group, the Black Aces, a four-piece with Eno on drums that he formed with three friends he met at the youth club he visited in Melton. In late 1967, Eno pursued music once more, forming the Merchant Taylor's Simultaneous Cabinet, an avant-garde music, art, and performance trio with two Winchester undergraduates. This was followed by short stints in multiple avant-garde and college groups, including The Maxwell Demon and Dandelion and The War Damage which featured Eno as frontman who adapted a theatrical persona on stage and later played the guitar.

Career
1970s
In 1969, after separating from his wife, Eno moved to London where his professional music career began. He became involved with the Scratch Orchestra and the Portsmouth Sinfonia; Eno's first appearance on a commercially released recording is the Deutsche Grammophon edition of The Great Learning (1971) by Cornelius Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra which features Eno as one of the voices on the track ""Paragraph 7"". Another early recording was the soundtrack to Berlin Horse (1970), a nine-minute avant-garde art film by Malcolm Le Grice. At one point, Eno had to earn money as paste-up assistant for the advertisement section of a local paper for three months. He quit and became an electronics dealer by buying old speakers and making new cabinets for them before selling them to friends.
In 1971, Eno co-formed the glam and art rock band Roxy Music. He had a chance meeting with saxophonist Andy Mackay at a train station, which led to him joining the band. Eno later said: ""If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, I probably would have been an art teacher now"". Eno played on their first two albums, Roxy Music (1972) and For Your Pleasure (1973), and is credited as ""Eno"". On the records, Eno was noted as playing the VCS 3 synthesiser, whilst also being credited for tape effects, backing vocals, and production. Initially, Eno did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the group's mixing desk at the centre of the concert venue where he had a microphone to sing backup vocals. After the group secured a record deal, Eno joined them on stage playing the synthesiser and became known for his flamboyant costumes and makeup, partly stealing the spotlight from lead singer Bryan Ferry. After touring For Your Pleasure ended in mid-1973, Eno quit the band, citing disagreements with Ferry and his insistence on being in command of the group, which affected Eno's ability to incorporate his own ideas.

Almost immediately after his exit from Roxy Music, Eno embarked on his solo career. The first studio album that had been released after Eno left Roxy Music was a 1973 collaboration with then-King Crimson guitarist and founder Robert Fripp, which was entitled No Pussyfooting, stylised as ""(No Pussyfooting)"". The album had been worked on for over a year in the lead up to its release, particularly with the use of tape looping and delay systems, which would later be known as Frippertronics. The record is hailed as being groundbreaking for future developments in experimental drone and ambient music, although the term ""ambient music"" wasn't coined yet and had been labelled as ""electronic"". The pair followed their debut with a second album Evening Star (1975), and completed a European tour before splitting due to Fripp isolating himself from the public eye after the disbanding of King Crimson.
Eno's first solo studio album was Here Come the Warm Jets that same year, which was released with his mononymous name ""Eno"" still attached. The album notably features Fripp on several songs as a guitarist on the tracks ""Baby's On Fire"" and ""Driving Me Backwards"", and as a composer, corresponding to his guitar duties, on the song ""Blank Frank"". The album was critically acclaimed on initial reviews in the 1973-74 season, whilst later reviews touted the record as ""timeless"". No singles were released from the record.

In March 1974, he had also released the single ""Seven Deadly Finns"" with the B-side ""Later On"", his only top 40 hit in the UK. Eno and Kevin Ayers contributed music for the experimental/spoken word album Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy (1974) by poet June Campbell Cramer, whilst also producing The Portsmouth Sinfonia's 1974 albums Plays the Popular Classics and Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall, both of which feature Eno playing the clarinet. After recording it in September that year, Eno released his second solo studio album, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy),  in November 1974. Featuring fellow artists and collaborators such as Phil Collins, Phil Manzanera, Robert Wyatt and Andy Mackay, the album featured numerous efforts of artistic pop and rock, but distanced itself from the psychedelia and avant-pop qualities from Here Come the Warm Jets. Taking Tiger Mountain contains the track ""Third Uncle"", which has been regarded as one of Eno's best-known songs of his pop and rock phase, owing in part to its later cover by Bauhaus and the Eno-collaborated cover with 801. Critic Dave Thompson writes that the song is ""a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion"" and that it ""could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist."" ""Third Uncle"" was released as a single in France that year, with the B-side of ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg"", also from Taking Tiger Mountain.

Between 1974 and 1975, Eno began to write new material for a third solo studio album. Within this time, in January 1975, Eno was hit by a taxi cab while crossing the street and spent several weeks recuperating and room-ridden at home. During this time, one of Eno's closest friends and fellow artist Judy Nylon had brought him a record of 18th century harp music. After she had left, he put on the record and lay down. He then realised that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. Immediately following a full recovery, he began to experiment with several instruments and tools in Island Studios (now known as Basing Street Studios). Between July and August 1975, he had recorded what would become Another Green World. The album was released on 14 November 1975 but did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The album predominantly featured instrumental tracks, with notable fragments of minimalism and avant-garde tensing throughout the 40 minute record. Those that had featured vocals, such as ""Everything Merges With The Night"", ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and ""Golden Hours"" were met with praise. The track ""Zawinul / Lava"" is a homage and tribute to Austrian jazz fusion keyboardist and composer Joe Zawinul. The only song to have any single release was ""I'll Come Running"", which became the B-side to Eno's cover of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight (Wimoweh)"". The album has been recognised by critics as a ""universally acknowledged masterpiece"" and ""breathtakingly ahead of its time"". The acclaimed music journalist Robert Christgau rated the album as an ""A+"", stating that it was ""the aural equivalent of a park on the Moon; oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity"".
In 1975 Eno had released the minimalist-electronic record Discreet Music (1975), created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP. Considered to be a landmark of the ambient music genre and the first record of Eno's to feature his full name, the album only features four tracks, one of which is the 30-minute long ""Discreet Music"", which features synthesised tape delays by Eno on an echo configuration. Gavin Bryars and The Cockpit Ensemble co-arranged and performed the B-side of the record, which were three variations on Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel. The titles of the variations were of an inaccurate translation of the French cover notes for the “Erato” recording of the piece made by the orchestra of Jean Francois Paillard. The album was remarked as a favourite record of David Bowie and, as a result of the record and its recognition to Bowie, it had led to his collaboration with Eno on Bowie's Berlin Trilogy.
After Discreet Music Eno released two other experimental-electronic albums: the Fripp-collaborated Evening Star (1975) and the Roedelius-Moebius collaborated Cluster & Eno (1977). In December 1977 he released Before and After Science, which featured electronic and artistic rock compositions with vocals. It was touted, by Allmusic reviewer David Ross Smith, as ""a study of ""studio composition"" whereby recordings are created by ""deconstruction and elimination"". Compared to Another Green World's nine instrumental tracks, Before and After Science only features two instrumental tracks, ""Energy Fools The Magician"", and ""Through Hollow Lands"", a track dedicated to Harold Budd. Before and After Science is perhaps best known for its heavily acclaimed electric-keyboard based track ""By This River"" and the coincidentally-anagrammed track ""King's Lead Hat"", a homage to Talking Heads.
In 1977 Eno assisted David Bowie and Tony Visconti for Bowie's album Low. It was during these sessions that he began work on his next solo project, released in 1978 as the first of his Ambient series, Ambient 1: Music for Airports. He coined the term ""ambient music"", which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying the record, he wrote: ""Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."" The following records after the release of Ambient 1 and the subsequent series inclusions were The Plateaux of Mirror (Ambient 2) featuring Harold Budd, Day of Radiance (Ambient 3) with American composer Laraaji, and On Land (Ambient 4), a solo record.

1980s
Eno provided a film score for Herbert Vesely's Egon Schiele – Exzess und Bestrafung (1980), also known as Egon Schiele – Excess and Punishment. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.
Before Eno made Ambient 4: On Land (1982), Robert Quine played him Miles Davis' 32-minute long avant-fusion piece ""He Loved Him Madly"" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for On Land, ""Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the 'spacious' quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film Amarcord, it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.""
In 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to Ghana for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with David Byrne of Talking Heads. Their album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected while living in the United States, along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and Middle Eastern rhythms.
In 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, Roger, and noted accomplice and friend Daniel Lanois, on what would be Brian Eno's ninth full-length album Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks. The album had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film For All Mankind (1989). Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including Trainspotting.

1990s
In September 1992, Eno released Nerve Net, an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, Benmont Tench, Robert Quine and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame. This album was a last-minute substitution for My Squelchy Life, which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals. Several tracks from My Squelchy Life later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set Eno Box II: Vocals, and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of Nerve Net. Eno released The Shutov Assembly in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces atonality and abandons most conventional concepts of modes, scales and pitch. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the tonic that underpins the Western tonal tradition, the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.
During the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called generative music. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound. In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including I Dormienti (The Sleepers), Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace, and Music for Civic Recovery Centre.
In 1993, Eno worked with the Manchester rock band James to produce two albums, Laid and Wah Wah. Laid was met with notable critical and commercial success both in the UK and the United States after its release in 1993. Wah Wah, in comparison, received a more lukewarm response after its release in 1994.
One of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of U2, Luciano Pavarotti and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1, which reached No. 76 on the US Billboard charts and No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It featured a single, ""Miss Sarajevo"", which reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book A Year with Swollen Appendices, a diary published in 1996. In 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series Neverwhere.

2000s
In 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, The Equatorial Stars.
Eno returned in June 2005 with Another Day on Earth, his first major album since Wrong Way Up (with John Cale) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with Everything That Happens Will Happen Today). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact of technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.
In early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.
An unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the multi-tracks of two songs from the album, ""A Secret Life"" and ""Help Me Somebody"". This allowed listeners to remix and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.

In late 2006, Eno released 77 Million Paintings, a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of ""77 Million Paintings"" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, California, Annabeth Robinson (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated 77 Million Paintings in Second Life.
The Nokia 8800 Sirocco Edition mobile phone, released in late 2006, features exclusive ringtones and sounds composed by Eno. Although he was previously uninterested in composing ringtones due to the limited sound palette of monophonic ringtones, phones at this point primarily used audio files. Between 8 January 2007 and 12 February 2007, ten units of Nokia 8800 Sirocco Brian Eno Signature Edition mobile phones, individually numbered and engraved with Eno's signature, were auctioned off. All proceeds went to two charities chosen by Eno: the Keiskamma AIDS treatment program and the World Land Trust. Eno's music was featured in a movie adaption of Irvine Welsh's best-selling collection Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance (2007). He also appeared playing keyboards in Voila, Belinda Carlisle's solo album sung entirely in French. Eno also contributed a composition titled ""Grafton Street"" to Dido's third album, Safe Trip Home, released in November 2008.
In 2008, he released Everything That Happens Will Happen Today with David Byrne, designed the sound for the video game Spore and wrote a chapter to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture, edited by Paul D. Miller (a.k.a. DJ Spooky).
In June 2009, Eno curated the Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House, culminating in his first live appearance in many years. ""Pure Scenius"" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Australian improvisation trio The Necks, Karl Hyde from Underworld, electronic artist Jon Hopkins and guitarist Leo Abrahams. Eno scored the music for Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lovely Bones, released in December 2009.

2010s
Eno released another solo album on Warp in late 2010. Small Craft on a Milk Sea, made in association with long-time collaborators Leo Abrahams and Jon Hopkins, was released on 2 November in the United States and 15 November in the UK. The album included five compositions  that were adaptions of those tracks that Eno wrote for The Lovely Bones. He later released Drums Between the Bells, a collaboration with poet Rick Holland, on 4 July 2011. In November 2012, Eno released Lux, a 76-minute composition in four sections, through Warp.
Eno worked with French–Algerian Raï singer Rachid Taha on Taha's  Tékitoi (2004) and Zoom (2013) albums, contributing percussion, bass, brass and vocals. Eno also performed with Taha at the Stop the War Coalition concert in London in 2005.
In April 2014, Eno sang on, co-wrote, and co-produced Damon Albarn's Heavy Seas of Love, from his solo debut album Everyday Robots. In May, Eno and Underworld's Karl Hyde released Someday World, featuring various guest musicians: from Coldplay's Will Champion and Roxy Music's Andy Mackay to newer names such as 22-year-old Fred Gibson, who helped produce the record with Eno. Within weeks of that release, a second full-length album was announced titled High Life. This was released on 30 June 2014.

In January 2016, a new Eno ambient soundscape was premiered as part of Michael Benson's planetary photography exhibition ""Otherworlds"" in the Jerwood Gallery of London's Natural History Museum. In a statement Eno commented on the unnamed half-hour piece: We can't experience space directly; those few who've been out there have done so inside precarious cocoons. They float in silence, for space has no air, nothing to vibrate – and therefore no sound. Nonetheless we can't resist imagining space as a sonic experience, translating our feelings about it into music. In the past we saw the universe as a perfect, divine creation – logical, finite, deterministic – and our art reflected that. The discoveries of the Space age have revealed instead a chaotic, unstable and vibrant reality, constantly changing. This music tries to reflect that new understanding.
The Ship, an album with music from Eno's installation of the same name was released on 29 April 2016 on Warp. The album notably features actor Peter Serafinowicz providing vocal credits on the third part of the ""Fickle Sun"" suite, which is a cover of the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Set Free"", from the group's 1969 album, The Velvet Underground; the track was written by frontman Lou Reed. In September that same year, the Portuguese synthpop band The Gift, released a single entitled Love Without Violins. As well as singing on the track, Eno co-wrote and produced it. The single was released on the band's own record label La Folie Records on 30 September.
Eno's Reflection, an album of ambient, generative music, was released on Warp Records on 1 January. 2017. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for 2018's 60th Grammy awards ceremony.
In April 2018, Eno released The Weight Of History / Only Once Away My Son, a collaborative double A-side with Kevin Shields, for Record Store Day.
In 2019, Eno participated in DAU, an immersive art and cultural installation in Paris by Russian film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky evoking life under Soviet authoritarian rule. Eno contributed six auditory ambiances.

2020s
In March 2020, Eno and his brother, Roger Eno, released their collaborative album Mixing Colours. Eno provided original music for Ben Lawrence's 2021 documentary Ithaka about John Shipton's battle to save his son, Julian Assange. In October 2022, he released a mostly voice-based album called Foreverandevernomore. An instrumental version of the record, entitled the Forever Voiceless Edition, was released in April 2023. The single Making Gardens Out of Silence in the Uncanny Valley, which replaced the concluding track on the origin release of Foreverandevernomore on the Japanese version of the CD, was released in February 2023. In May 2023, he released a collaborative album with long-time colleague and protege Fred again.. called Secret Life through Four Tet's label Text Records. In June the same year, he released a collaborative single with The Leisure Society called 'Brave Are The Waves' on Willkommen Records.

Record producer
From the beginning of his solo career in 1973, Eno was in demand as a record producer. The first album with Eno credited as producer was Lucky Leif and the Longships by Robert Calvert. Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for Talking Heads, U2, Devo, Ultravox and James. He also produced part of the 1993 album When I Was a Boy by Jane Siberry. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT Awards.
Eno has consistently described himself as a ""non-musician"", using the term ""treatments"" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill in using the studio as a compositional tool led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on Genesis's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, he is credited with 'Enossification'; on Robert Wyatt's Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard with a Direct inject anti-jazz raygun and on John Cale's Island albums as simply being ""Eno"".
Eno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as Nico, Robert Calvert, Genesis, David Bowie, and Zvuki Mu, in various capacities such as use of his studio and electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and under a mononymous stage name (Eno). In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the ""Prophecy Theme"" for the David Lynch film Dune; the rest of the soundtrack was composed and performed by the group Toto. Eno produced performance artist Laurie Anderson's Bright Red album, and also composed for it. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for The Catherine Wheel, a project commissioned by Twyla Tharp to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.
He worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977–79 Berlin Trilogy of albums, Low, ""Heroes"" and Lodger, on Bowie's later album Outside, and on the song ""I'm Afraid of Americans"". Playing a portable EMS Synthi A synthesiser, Eno created most of the spacey effects on Low. After Bowie died in January 2016, following the release of his Blackstar album, Eno said that he and Bowie had been talking about taking Outside, the last album they had worked on together, ""somewhere new"", and expressed regret that they would not be able to pursue the project.
In 1978, Eno discovered and promoted the no wave movement by attending a five night underground no wave music festival at Artists Space in New York City that featured ten local bands, including the Gynecologists, Communists, Theoretical Girls, Terminal, Chatham's Tone Death (performing his composition for electric guitars Guitar Trio) and Branca's other band Daily Life. The final two days of the show featured DNA and the Contortions on Friday, followed by Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks on Saturday. Eno, who had originally come to New York to produce the second Talking Heads album More Songs About Buildings and Food, was impressed by what he saw and heard, and advised by Diego Cortez to do so, was convinced that this movement should be documented and proposed the idea of a compilation album, No New York, with himself as a producer.
Eno co-produced The Unforgettable Fire (1984), The Joshua Tree (1987), Achtung Baby (1991), and All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) for U2 with his frequent collaborator Daniel Lanois, and produced 1993's Zooropa with Mark ""Flood"" Ellis. In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers, songs from which included ""Your Blue Room"" and ""Miss Sarajevo"".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994), Millionaires (1999) and Pleased to Meet You (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for ""frequent interference and occasional co-production"" on their 1997 album Whiplash.
Eno played on the 1986 album Measure for Measure by Australian band Icehouse. He remixed two tracks for Depeche Mode, ""I Feel You"" and ""In Your Room"", both single releases from the album Songs of Faith and Devotion in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of ""Protection"" by Massive Attack (originally from their Protection album) for release as a single.
In 2007, Eno produced the fourth studio album by Coldplay, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, released in 2008 to acclaim. In 2008, he worked with Grace Jones on her album Hurricane, and was credited for ""production consultation"" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the 12 studio album by U2, again with Lanois, No Line on the Horizon. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and Dublin and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.
In 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed ""enoxification"" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, released on 24 October.

The Microsoft Sound
In 1994, the Microsoft designers Mark Malamud and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for Windows 95. The result was the six-second start-up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating system, ""The Microsoft Sound"". In an interview with Joel Selvin in the San Francisco Chronicle, Eno said:

The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, ""Here's a specific problem – solve it.""
The thing from the agency said, ""We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,"" this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said ""and it must be 3+1⁄4 seconds long.""
I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel.

In fact, I made eighty-four pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.
Eno shed further light on the composition of the sound on the BBC Radio 4 show The Museum of Curiosity, admitting that he created it using a Macintosh computer, stating ""I wrote it on a Mac. I've never used a PC in my life; I don't like them.""

Video work
Eno has spoken of an early and ongoing interest in exploring light in a similar way to his work with sound. He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:
""One afternoon while I was working in the studio with Talking Heads, the roadie from Foreigner, working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.""
The Panasonic industrial camera Eno received had significant design flaws preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation. The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan (1980) and Thursday Afternoon (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained that he refers to them as 'video paintings' because ""if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.""
These works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.
Eno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as 77 Million Paintings in 2006.

Generative music
Eno gives the example of wind chimes. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: ""I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like Terry Riley, and when I first started playing with tape recorders.""

Initially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create generative music systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.
In 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release Generative Music 1 - which requires Intermorphic's Koan Player software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.

Generative Music 1
In 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO Koan generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing Generative Music 1—only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: Wander (2001) and Dark Symphony (2007)—both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).

Released excerpts
Eno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album Discreet Music. Then again in 1978 with Music for Airports:

Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and myself. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable – they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system.
The list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:

2023 - Secret Life (with Fred again..) [10% broken algorithm edit]
Several of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations. Most notably The Shutov Assembly (view breakdown of Album's sources), Contra 1.2 thru to Compact Forest Proposal, Lux, CAM, and The Ship.

Installations and other works
Eno has created installations combining artworks and sound that have shown across the world since 1979, beginning with 2 Fifth Avenue and White Fence, in the Kitchen Centre, New York, NY. Typically Eno's installations feature light as a medium explored in multi-screen configurations, and music that is created to blur the boundaries between itself and its surroundings:
With each installation, Eno's music and artworks interrogate the visitors' perception of space and time within a seductive, immersive environment. Since his experiments with sound as an art student using reel to reel tape recorders, - and in art employing the medium of light, Eno has utilised breakthroughs in technology to develop 'processes rather than final objects', processes that in themselves have to ""jolt your senses,"" have ""got to be seductive."" Once set in motion these processes produce potentially continuous music and artworks that Eno, though the artist, could not have imagined; and with them he creates the slowly unfolding immersive environments of his installations.
Early installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. ""2 Fifth Avenue"", (""a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports"") resulted from Eno shooting ""the view from his apartment window: without ... intervention,"" recording ""what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time ... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. ... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'""
From the outset, Eno's video works, were ""more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema"". The author and artist John Coulthart called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980–81), which incorporated music from Ambient 4: On Land (1982), ""The first ambient film."" He explains: ""Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980–81. The low-grade equipment ... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality. Lack of a tripod meant filming with the camera lying on its side so the tape had to be re-viewed with a television monitor also turned on its side."" And turning the TV on its side, says David A. Ross, ""recontextualize[d] the television set, and ... subliminally shift[ed] the way the video image represents recognizable realities ... Natural phenomena like rain look quite different in this orientation; less familiar but curiously more real.""

Thursday Afternoon (1985) was a return to using figurative form, for Eno had by now begun ""to think that I could use my TVs as light sources rather than as image sources. ... TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented – because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface.."" Turning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. ""The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence."" Calling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.
By positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the I Dormienti show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by Mimmo Paladino in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.
Envisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at Castello Svevo in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, ""sculptural objects [that] ... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit."" The first version of these were shown at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam(1984). Since On Land (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.
In the antithesis of 20th century shock art, Eno's works create environments that are: ""Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses."" Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series (1986-2001) of installations that have shown across the world, and include Music for Civic Recovery Centre at the David Toop curated Sonic Boom festival at the Hayward Gallery in 2000. The Quiet Club series grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as ""tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks"". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.
The continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations militate against habituation to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. ""One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less ""dramatic"" and more sensual."" Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. ""Compact Forest Proposal"" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: ""During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.""
In Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions. The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.

77 Million Paintings
Developments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation 77 Million Paintings for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. ""One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined…"" 
Most (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier Natural Selections exhibition projected onto the windows of the Triennale in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.
For the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Markgraph, used new technology by Dataton that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources. But, unlike the software developed for 77 Million, this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.
With the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary. In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: ""Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. …The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.""
Although designed for the domestic environment, 77 Million Paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the Sydney Opera House (2009), Carioca Aqueduct (the Arcos di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors. Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest ""Light Boxes"" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.

Montefiore Hospital Installations
In 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England. In the hospital's reception area ""77 Million Paintings for Montefiore"" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named ""Quiet Room for Montefiore"" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.

Spore
Eno composed most of the music for the Electronic Arts video game Spore (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer Peter Chilvers. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.

iOS apps
Inspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game Spore (2008), the two began to release generative music in the Apple App format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad:

Bloom (2008)
Trope (2009)
Scape (2012)
Reflection (2016)
In 2009, Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled Air (released through generativemusic.com as well)—based on concepts developed by Eno in his Ambient 1: Music for Airports album.

Reflection
The generative version of Reflection is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released Reflection provides no real options other than Play/Pause – later, in its initial update, AirPlay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:

As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.
In other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.

As a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time. To access it, simply update REFLECTION in the App Store and follow the instructions when you open the app on your device. The download will be available until 28th February [2017]. and the App's Apples iTunes page
Previous to the updates for the App, the iTunes page used the following from Eno. 

Reflection is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far.
My original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time – 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings – whether vinyl, cassette or CD – are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form – on vinyl or CD – is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.

The creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode – a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time – many days and weeks in fact – seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.
The version of Reflection available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the Reflection app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:

[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?
[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.
[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?

[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together.

Artworks: Light Boxes
Eno's ""light boxes"" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in Kite Stories (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer ""is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself"". He likens Eno's art to ""Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.""
First shown commercially at the Paul Stolper Gallery in London (forming the Light Music exhibition in 2016 that included lenticular paintings by Eno), light boxes have been shown across the world. They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's light paintings have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.

Obscure Records
Eno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of German baroque composer Johann Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape loop system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Robert Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage.

Other work
In 1995, Eno travelled with Edinburgh University's Professor Nigel Osborne to Bosnia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War, to work with war-traumatised children, many of whom had been orphaned in the conflict.  Osborne and Eno led music therapy projects run by War Child in Mostar, at the Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.
Eno appeared as Father Brian Eno at the ""It's Great Being a Priest!"" convention, in ""Going to America"", the final episode of the television sitcom Father Ted, which originally aired on 1 May 1998 on Channel 4.
In March 2008, Eno collaborated with the Italian artist Mimmo Paladino on a show of the latter's works with Eno's soundscapes at Ara Pacis in Rome, and in 2011, he joined Stephen Deazley and Edinburgh University music lecturer Martin Parker in an Icebreaker concert at Glasgow City Halls, heralded as a ""long-awaited clash"".
In 2013, Eno sold limited edition prints of artwork from his 2012 album Lux from his website.
In 2016, Eno was added to Edinburgh University's roll of honour and in 2017, he delivered the Andrew Carnegie Lecture at the university.
In 2021, Eno co-founded EarthPercent, a charity which works with the music industry to raise funds for climate causes. As of April 2024, over $675,000 has been donated by EarthPercent to their grant partners in the climate space. Supporters include AURORA, Nile Rodgers, Coldplay, Hot Chip, Ricardo Villalobos, Fraser T Smith, Big Thief and Mount Kimbie.   
Eno continues to be active in other artistic fields. His sound installations have been exhibited in many prestigious venues around the world, including the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Contemporary Arts Museum Houston; New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Vancouver Art Gallery, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Centre Pompidou, Paris, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, Baltic Art Centre, Gateshead, and the Sydney, São Paulo, Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport, FF Projects, San Pedro Garza García, and Venice Biennials.
In 2020-2021 Eno is working with a group of developers on audio-video conferencing software and service that addresses issues of corporate video conferencing software (like Zoom) when used for other purposes.

Awards and honours
Asteroid 81948 Eno, discovered by Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo in 2000, was named in his honour. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (M.P.C. 114955).
In 2019, he was awarded Starmus Festival's Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication for Music & Arts.

Influence and legacy
Eno is frequently referred to as one of popular music's most influential artists. Producer and film composer Jon Brion has said: ""I think he's the most influential artist since the Beatles."" Critic Jason Ankeny at AllMusic argues that Eno ""forever altered the ways in which music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence."" Eno has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style informed a number of projects in which he has been involved, including Bowie's ""Berlin Trilogy"" (helping to popularise minimalism) and the albums he produced for Talking Heads (incorporating, on Eno's advice, African music and polyrhythms), Devo, and other groups. Eno's first collaboration with David Byrne, 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, utilised sampling techniques and broke ground by incorporating world music into popular Western music forms. Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies have been used by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: ""his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians;– particularly electronic musicians;– view the studio. No longer is it just a passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities."" According to Vinyl Me, Please writer Jack Riedy, Eno's peak as an artist coincided with the album era – a period in popular music during which the album surpassed the single as the dominant recorded-music format – ""and Eno took full advantage of the format to pursue all his musical ideas on wax.""
Whilst inspired by the ideas of minimalist composers including John Cage, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Erik Satie, Eno coined the term ambient music to describe his own work and defined the term. The Ambient Music Guide states that he has brought from ""relative obscurity into the popular consciousness"" fundamental ideas about ambient music, including ""the idea of modern music as subtle atmosphere, as chill-out, as impressionistic, as something that creates space for quiet reflection or relaxation."" His groundbreaking work in electronic music has been said to have brought widespread attention to and innovations in the role of electronic technology in recording. Pink Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright said he ""often eulogised"" Eno's abilities.
Eno's ""unconventional studio predilections"", in common with those of Peter Gabriel, were an influence on the recording of ""In the Air Tonight"", the single which launched the solo career of Eno's former drummer Phil Collins. Collins said he ""learned a lot"" from working with Eno. Both Half Man Half Biscuit (in the song ""Eno Collaboration"" on the EP of the same name) and MGMT have written songs about Eno. LCD Soundsystem has frequently cited Eno as a key influence. The Icelandic singer Björk also credited Eno as a major influence.
Mora sti Fotia (Babies on Fire), one of the most influential Greek rock bands, was named after Eno's song ""Baby's on Fire"" from the 1973 album Here Come the Warm Jets.
In 2011, Belgian academics from the Royal Museum for Central Africa named a species of Afrotropical spider Pseudocorinna brianeno in his honour.
In September 2016, asked by the website Just Six Degrees to name a currently influential artist, Eno cited the conceptual, video and installation artist Jeremy Deller as a source of current inspiration: ""Deller's work is often technically very ambitious, involving organising large groups of volunteers and helpers, but he himself is almost invisible in the end result. I'm inspired by this quietly subversive way of being an artist, setting up situations and then letting them play out. To me it's a form of social generative art where the 'generators' are people and their experiences, and where the role of the artist is to create a context within which they collide and create.""

Personal life
Eno has married twice. In March 1967, at the age of 18, Eno married Sarah Grenville. The couple had a daughter, Hannah Louise (b. 1967), before their divorce. In 1988, Eno married his then-manager Anthea Norman-Taylor. They have two daughters, Irial Violet (b. 1990) and Darla Joy (b. 1991).
In an interview with Michael Bonner, published in the May 2020 issue of Uncut, Eno referred to Ray Hearn as his current manager, and also referred to his girlfriend.
Raised Catholic, Eno has referred to himself as ""kind of an evangelical atheist"" but has also professed an interest in religion. In 1996, Eno and others started the Long Now Foundation to educate the public about the very long-term future of society and to encourage long-term thinking in the exploration of enduring solutions to global issues. Through the Long Now foundation's Long Bets, he won a $500 bet made in 2003 (equivalent to $830 in 2023) by challenging someone who predicted a Democrat would be president of the United States following the 2004 election.
In 1991, Eno appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His chosen book was Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity by Richard Rorty and his luxury item was a radio telescope.

Politics
In 2007, Eno joined the Liberal Democrats as youth adviser under Nick Clegg.
In 2017, Eno signed an open letter as a member of the Labour Party and has stated that voting for the Liberal Democrats is ""voting Tory without admitting it"". In August 2015, he endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said at a rally in Camden Town Hall: ""I don't think electability really is the most important thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda."" He later wrote in The Guardian: ""He's [Corbyn] been doing this with courage and integrity and with very little publicity. This already distinguishes him from at least half the people in Westminster, whose strongest motivation seems to have been to get elected, whatever it takes.""

In 2006, Eno was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter calling for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions. and in January 2009 he spoke out against Israel's military action on the Gaza Strip by writing an opinion for CounterPunch and participating in a large-scale protest in London. In 2014, Eno again protested publicly against what he called a ""one-sided exercise in ethnic cleansing"" and a ""war [with] no moral justification,"" in reference to the 2014 military operation of Israel into Gaza. He was also a co-signatory, along with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker and others, to a letter published in The Guardian that labelled the conflict as an ""inhumane and illegal act of military aggression"" and called for ""a comprehensive and legally binding military embargo on Israel, similar to that imposed on South Africa during apartheid.""
In 2013, Eno became a patron of Videre est Credere (Latin: ""to see is to believe""), a UK human rights charity. Videre describes itself as ""give[ing] local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations. This captured footage is verified, analysed and then distributed to those who can create change."" He participates alongside movie producers Uri Fruchtmann and Terry Gilliam – along with executive director of Greenpeace UK John Sauven.
Eno was appointed President of Stop the War Coalition in 2017. He has had a long involvement with the organisation since it was set up in 2001.
He is also a trustee of the environmental law charity ClientEarth, Somerset House, and the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, set up by Mariana Mazzucato.
Eno opposes United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the June 2016 referendum result when the British public voted to leave, Eno was among a group of British musicians who signed a letter to the Prime Minister Theresa May calling for a second referendum.
In November 2019, along with other public figures, Eno signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as ""a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world"" and endorsed him for in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that ""Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.""
In April 2021, Eno was a participant in the ""Live for Gaza"", online concert which was held in April 2021. Artists from, Gaza included Gaza's first rock group Osprey V, Wafaa Alnjeili, and Badeel Band. 
Brian Eno is an early and prominent member of Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) where he contributes, issues statements, and takes part in media events and discussions.
In October 2023, Eno signed an open letter of artists for ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. In November 2023, he signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire and an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip.

Buckethead,"Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, is an American guitarist, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. He has received critical acclaim for his innovative virtuoso electric guitar playing. His music spans several genres, including progressive metal, funk, blues, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music. He performs primarily as a solo artist, although he has collaborated with a wide variety of artists such as Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Les Claypool, Serj Tankian, Bill Moseley, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, That 1 Guy, and Skating Polly. He was also a member of Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. He has recorded 640 studio albums, four special releases, and one EP. He has performed on more than fifty albums by other artists. Buckethead has written and performed music for major motion pictures, including Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Last Action Hero, Falling, and contributed lead guitar to the track ""Firebird"" featured on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie soundtrack.
Buckethead performs wearing a KFC bucket on his head, sometimes emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker reading FUNERAL in block letters. This is accompanied by an expressionless plain white mask inspired by the 1988 slasher film Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers. He also incorporates nunchaku and robot dancing into his stage performances.
Buckethead was credited by Guitar World as ""ushering in [a] new era of virtuosity"" while ranking the release of his 1992 debut album Bucketheadland the 45th greatest moment in electric guitar history.  The magazine has also listed him among the ""25 all-time weirdest guitarists"" and the ""50 fastest guitarists of all time"".

Early and personal life
Brian Patrick Carroll was born on May 13, 1969, to Tom and Nancy Carroll; he is the youngest of five siblings along with Lynn, Lisa, Lori, and John. His father was the athletic director at Damien High School in La Verne, California from 1973 until his retirement in 2013.
Carroll grew up in a Southern California suburb near Disneyland. In his youth he was an introvert and spent most of his time in his room with books, games, martial-arts movie memorabilia, and toys. He also spent a lot of time at Disneyland.
Carroll began playing guitar at the age of 12. He learned to play from an elderly man down his road. He is quoted saying that he became serious a year later after moving from Huntington Beach, California, to Claremont. His playing improved with lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown, Joey Tafolla, and Paul Gilbert. In 2003, Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers as the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007–2008.
The Buckethead persona came to be when Carroll saw the 1988 slasher film Halloween 4 and was inspired by the film. He went out right after seeing it and bought a Michael Myers-like white mask. The bucket idea came later that night while eating chicken:

I was eating it, and I put the mask on and then the bucket on my head. I went to the mirror. I just said, 'Buckethead. That's Buckethead right there.' It was just one of those things. After that, I wanted to be that thing all the time.
In October 2017, Carroll gave a rare out-of-character interview discussing all ranges of his life, the Buckethead character, his parents' deaths, his health problems, and how he copes with overcoming fear. During the podcast, he revealed he has been diagnosed with the potentially life-threatening condition of heart arrhythmia. He stated he had a cardiac ablation performed and uses medicine to control the problem.

Career
1988–1994: Early solo career and Praxis
In 1988, after leaving the band Class-X, Carroll entered a song called ""Brazos"" into a Guitar Player magazine contest. It was a runner-up, with editors writing:

An astonishingly skilled guitarist and bassist, he demonstrates post-Paul Gilbert speed and accuracy filtered through very kinky harmonic sensibilities. His psychotronic, demonic edge is very, very far removed from the clichés of classical metal and rock. A real talent to watch, also known as ""Buckethead.""
In the same year, the magazine's editor, Jas Obrecht, came to know of Buckethead when Carroll and his parents left a demo recording at the magazine's reception desk for Obrecht. Impressed with this demo, he rushed into the restaurant where Buckethead and his parents were having lunch and encouraged him to make the most of his talent. They soon became friends. In 1989, a song called ""Soowee"" by Buckethead got honorable mention in another song contest. In 1991, Buckethead moved into Obrecht's basement. The song ""Brazos"" was eventually released on the 1991 demo tape of his band Deli Creeps, titled ""Tribal Rites"", and again as bonus material in Buckethead's Secret Recipe DVD in 2006. Luke Sacco was his teacher.
In 1991, Buckethead contributed to Derek Bailey's Company project alongside, among others, John Zorn and Alexander Bălănescu, resulting in a triple album called Company 91.
After his first two demo tapes, called Giant Robot and Bucketheadland Blueprints, Buckethead released Bucketheadland on John Zorn's Japanese Avant record label in 1992. Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer Bill Laswell, himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia, who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room. Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides Nicky Skopelitis.
In 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, and Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia, formed the supergroup Praxis. Their first album, Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis), released the same year, was well received. The project was Bill Laswell's concept, and has since involved other guests such as Serj Tankian of System of a Down, among many others. Buckethead participated in every release except the initial 1984 release and Mold (1998).
In 1993, Buckethead auditioned to play for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band eventually ended up with Arik Marshall, and later Dave Navarro. After some legal complications with Sony Music Entertainment, Buckethead decided to release his 1994 album Dreamatorium under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram).

Death Cube K is a separate entity that looks like a photographic negative version of Buckethead with a black chrome mask, like Darth Vader. This apparition haunts Buckethead and appears in his nightmares.
Buckethead released a second studio album that year, Giant Robot, which features many guest appearances by artists such as Iggy Pop and Bill Moseley. The name of the album came from the Japanese series Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot, of which Buckethead is a fan. He also released two other albums with Praxis, their second and third studio efforts: Sacrifist and Metatron.

1995–1999: Collaboration work, movie soundtracks and Praxis
In 1995, Buckethead did not release any solo albums but collaborated with several artists like Jonas Hellborg and Michael Shrieve (Octave of the Holy Innocents). He also contributed to several movie soundtracks, such as Johnny Mnemonic and Mortal Kombat.
Later, in 1996, Buckethead released his solo album The Day of the Robot with the help of English producer DJ Ninj and Laswell, plus another album with Brain and keyboardist Pete Scaturro on the small Japanese label NTT Records, called Giant Robot. Both albums were printed only in small quantities and are collectors' items now. A second demo tape by the Deli Creeps was also recorded.
Also in 1996, several Sega Saturn television ads featuring a screaming mask-like face pressing through the blue orb of the Saturn logo was released, with music by Buckethead.
In 1997, Buckethead began working on the album Buckethead Plays Disney, but the album has not yet been released. According to his Web page:

This highly anticipated album, once listed in an Avant catalog, has yet to be completed. It is Buckethead's most precious personal project, so he won't record or release it until he knows he is ready.
Also in 1997, Buckethead continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, appearing on Beverly Hills Ninja and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, the sequel to Mortal Kombat.
Further releases were Arcana's second and final studio album Arc of the Testimony in which he played with noted drummer Tony Williams and the one-off project Pieces, with Brain. Two live albums by Praxis, called Transmutation Live and Live in Poland (featuring recordings from European concerts) were also issued.
Death Cube K released an album that year called Disembodied.
In 1998, Buckethead released Colma, an album dedicated to his mother, who at the time was suffering from colon cancer.  A compilation album by Praxis called Coll ction also came out that year.
In 1999, Buckethead released his fifth album, a collaboration with Les Claypool from the band Primus, titled Monsters and Robots—currently the best-selling album of his career. The album includes the song ""The Ballad of Buckethead"", for which his first music video ever was made.
Buckethead began three new projects that year, the first being the band Cornbugs, a collaboration with actor Bill Moseley, drummer Pinchface, and later keyboardist Travis Dickerson. Another project, Cobra Strike with an album called The 13th Scroll, featured Pinchface, Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia, DJ Disk, and Bill Laswell. Buckethead also began a collaboration with actor Viggo Mortensen, whom he first met through a recording project called Myth: Dreams of the World in 1996. Together they released One Man's Meat, One Less Thing to Worry About, and The Other Parade. Buckethead contributed to the 1999 album Devil Dub by the San Francisco Bay Area band Ben Wa consisting of ""Dr. Ware"" and ""House""(Limbomaniacs, Tommy Guerrero, Buckethead's Giant Robot, MCM & the Monster).

2000–2004: Guns N' Roses and other projects
Buckethead achieved a higher public profile as lead guitarist for Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. He recorded the often-delayed album Chinese Democracy with the band and appeared live on stage in 2001 and 2002, including Rock in Rio 3, MTV's Video Music Awards, and parts of the Chinese Democracy Tour. His guitar solo on ""There Was a Time"" received acclaim, with several publications listing it amongst the best solos of the decade.
Despite being a member of GN'R, Buckethead released his sixth studio album, called Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse in 2001, and also his only EP, called KFC Skin Piles. He also released two albums with his band Cornbugs, and a third under his 'Death Cube K' pseudonym. In 2000, Buckethead released the second and last album by Cobra Strike, called Cobra Strike II - Y, Y+B, X+Y. He joined two new projects during this period. The first was the progressive rock band Thanatopsis (named after a poem by William Cullen Bryant) with Travis Dickerson and drummer Ramy Antoun; this group went on to release four albums. Some Thanatopsis material has also appeared on albums released by Buckethead and Dickerson.
Buckethead's second side project during this period was with Bill Laswell and Japanese producer Shin Terai, released as the album Unison.
In 2002, Buckethead released three studio albums: Funnel Weaver, a collection of 49 short tracks, Bermuda Triangle, and finally, Electric Tears, a calming album that is similar to his earlier release, Colma.
When Laswell was not able to play with Praxis at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival, Les Claypool asked to jam with Brain, Bernie Worrell, and Buckethead, forming a new supergroup called Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains. The jamband experiment was successful enough to do some further live dates.
Later, in 2003, marking the release of his tenth studio album, Buckethead released the sequel of his debut Bucketheadland, simply called Bucketheadland 2. Together with actor Viggo Mortensen, he did Pandemoniumfromamerica, and with Thanatopsis, its second release, called Axiology.
Buckethead's relationship with Guns N' Roses was somewhat erratic in its last year, despite contractual obligations. According to an interview with Rose, he seemingly 'left' the band in January 2004 without telling anyone, and 'rejoined' in a similar manner in February. ""His transient lifestyle has made it impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communication with him whatsoever."" In March 2004, Buckethead left Guns N' Roses. His manager cited Guns' inability to complete an album or tour.
Since that time, his cult following in the underground music communities has steadily increased. He frequently performs at festivals and in clubs nationwide and often tours as the feature performer.
The year 2004 saw the release of three new studio albums: Island of Lost Minds, which was his first tour-only album being later re-released by TDRS Music; Population Override, a blues-rock tour de force with Dickerson; and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, considered his heaviest effort to date. The latter includes ""Spokes for the Wheel of Torment,"" for which Syd Garon and Eric Henry made a music video based on the famous triptychs by Hieronymus Bosch. Buckethead also recorded the final two albums by the Cornbugs, Brain Circus and Donkey Town as well as another release with Viggo Mortensen called Please Tomorrow and a second with Shin Terai, titled Heaven & Hell. C2B3 also released their only album, The Big Eyeball in the Sky, and toured it in North America.
In an interview with Revolver, Ozzy Osbourne said that he had offered to have Buckethead play guitar in his band at Ozzfest, but changed his mind after meeting with him and realizing that he would not remove his costume:

2005–2006: Buckethead & Friends
In 2005, Buckethead released the album Enter the Chicken through Serj Tankian's record label, Serjical Strike. The album features Tankian himself, Maximum Bob (of the Deli Creeps), Death by Stereo singer Efrem Shulz, Bad Acid Trip and others. It is marked by its leaning toward more traditional song structures while still featuring typical Buckethead guitar skills. ""We Are One"" was released as a single and also appeared on the soundtrack of Masters of Horror. ""Three Fingers"" was used for the soundtrack of the horror movie Saw II. The final track, ""Nottingham Lace"", was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, Kaleidoscalp and Inbred Mountain—the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.
Buckethead released albums with other bands that year: with Cornbugs, he released two compilation albums, called Rest Home for Robots and Skeleton Farm. Gorgone's self titled album was released that year' itself based upon recording sessions from the album Population Override that Buckethead released in 2004.

In 2006, the cross-console video game Guitar Hero II was launched, featuring Buckethead's song ""Jordan"" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song. When playing it live, Buckethead would almost always simply perform the verse and chorus of ""Jordan"" before transitioning into the next song. However, the Guitar Hero II version contains a special solo created specifically for the game.
Also the same year, Buckethead released two DVDs, titled Young Buckethead Vol. 1 and Young Buckethead Vol. 2, featuring rare footage from 1990 and 1991. The DVD also contains three complete Deli Creeps shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock and Crime Slunk Scene, both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song ""Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)""; this song (along with ""Jordan"" and ""Nottingham Lace"") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live. Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band Cornbugs, called Celebrity Psychos. He also released an album with Travis Dickerson, called Chicken Noodles, a move that would see the start of a four-year long collaboration with the keyboardist. Buckethead's band Thanatopsis would also release Anatomize that year.

2007–2010: Continued solo work and Michael Jackson tribute
In 2007, Buckethead released an unprecedented amount of new material. In February, a box set titled In Search of The, containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called Pepper's Ghost, was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called Acoustic Shards was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints, with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called  Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot and Cyborg Slunks. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD. Buckethead wrote three songs dedicated to Aunt Suzie in 2006-07: the aforementioned ""Soothsayer"" (Crime Slunk Scene), ""Aunt Suzie"" (Cyborg Slunks), and ""Sail On Soothsayer"", (Decoding The Tomb Of Bansheebot).
As Death Cube K, Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set Monolith, which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.
During 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists. The sequel to Chicken Noodles (a collaboration with Travis Dickerson), simply called Chicken Noodles II, was issued by TDRS in December. A live record by Praxis, titled Tennessee 2004; the third album with Shin Terai, called Lightyears; and another album with drummer Bryan Mantia, called Kevin's Noodle House, were also released through the year.
That same year, it was revealed that Buckethead joined a project by the name of Science Faxtion, a band featuring bassist Bootsy Collins and drummer Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia, with Greg Hampton supplying lead vocals. Their first album, called Living on Another Frequency, was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.

On January 1, 2008, the band Praxis released the long-awaited album Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness) in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt. That year Buckethead released From the Coop through the label Avabella (where he released Acoustic Shards), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever ""official"" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called Albino Slug (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album The Dragons of Eden, with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with That 1 Guy as the Frankenstein Brothers, an album called Bolt on Neck was released. That 1 Guy and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.
Buckethead also appeared in the documentary American Music: Off the Record, in which he appears only playing. Serj Tankian's label, Serjical Strike, reissued the album Enter the Chicken with an extra song. Furthermore, Buckethead contributed to one track of actor Viggo Mortensen's album At All, and with Travis Dickerson and filmmaker Alix Lambert on the album Running After Deer.
Buckethead appeared with Bootsy Collins in Cincinnati, Ohio, to promote the vote for the 2008 United States presidential election for the organization Rock the Vote.
He also joined Collins on Fallen Soldiers Memorial, an album with proceeds going to the National Fallen Heroes Foundation.
More than four years after his departure from the band Guns N' Roses, Chinese Democracy was made available. Buckethead appears on all but two songs and was given writing credits on ""Shackler's Revenge"" (which appeared in the popular video game Rock Band 2); ""Scraped""; and ""Sorry"", which features guest singer Sebastian Bach. The album features eleven of Buckethead's guitar solos.
On December 30, 2008, Buckethead released two new tracks via his website to honor basketball player LeBron James' 24th birthday. These tracks were later made available on the album, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie, which was released a month later through TDRS Music. In 2009 he released the albums A Real Diamond in the Rough, and Forensic Follies, which was first sold at some of his tour dates but later released on TDRS. That year he also released the track The Homing Beacon, a tribute to Michael Jackson, who had been an early influence on him. The song was later included on his 2012 album Electric Sea.
On February 5, 2010, Buckethead released an album called Shadows Between the Sky and later that month, Gibson released the Buckethead Signature Les Paul guitar.
On April 29, 2010, Buckethead's website was updated with a picture with the message ""Greetings from Bucketheadland... Buckethead wants you to know he appreciates your support all these years, it means so much to him. Buckethead is having some animatronic parts replaced, Slip Disc snuck into the park and caused some mayhem."" The mention of Slip Disc is a reference to a Bucketheadland nemesis found on the Bucketheadland album. Bootsy Collins continued to update his Twitter Web site about Buckethead's condition, stating that he had recently gone into therapy for a few months.
Nevertheless, after returning from injury on July 15, 2010, Buckethead, along with Brain and Melissa Reese, released the first of a series of three 5-CD box sets called Best Regards. On August 25, 2010, Buckethead announced his 28th studio album titled Spinal Clock, which showcased his banjo skills. In October, two albums with Brain were released in collaboration, the first called Brain as Hamenoodle, and the second installment of the ""Regards"" series with Brain and Melissa Reese called, Kind Regards. Eventually, both projects were released on October 13. That month also saw a new solo album titled Captain EO's Voyage first available only on iTunes. It was later announced that a physical edition would be released on December 1. This, along with Buckethead's final Travis Dickerson album were released on November 29. In May 2010, Buckethead started to release albums as part of the concept of a kiosk within Buckethead's fictional ""abusement"" park called ""Buckethead Pikes"". The albums released under this concept were to resemble a comic book style and be shorter in length than his previous works - around half-an-hour each.

2011–2015: Focus on solo Pikes
Buckethead left Praxis in 2011, the Frankenstein Brothers in 2012, and Brain in 2013. He contributed to two tracks on Lawson Rollins's album Elevation in 2011. He also departed from his live touring schedule, with his final performance taking place  on December 31, 2012. During his absence from touring and other projects, Buckethead's solo release schedule increased speed dramatically- reaching a peak in 2015 with 118 albums, around one every three days on average. Notably, the cover of Pike 13 contains a photograph of Buckethead unmasked; the first such image released to the public. The cover of Pike 13 does not feature the common elements of the Pikes series, and is simply a photograph of Buckethead during his teenage years, carrying an acoustic guitar and hugging his father. Buckethead continued to release albums throughout the year, breaking the numerical order occasionally (for example, Pike 34 Pikes was released three weeks after Pike 35 Thank you Ohlinger's). The final album of the year Wishes was released on December 24, free of charge for a limited time.

During 2014, Buckethead continued releasing albums at an even faster pace. Sixty albums were released throughout the year, averaging one album every six days. The sixty-fifth installment, Hold Me Forever (In memory of my mom Nancy York Carroll), honored Buckethead's mother, who had recently died. The final release of the year, Pike 101 In the Hollow Hills, took place on December 31.
Buckethead's release schedule increased in speed again, almost doubling his output during 2015. The 150th release in the series and 180th overall, Heaven is your Home (For my Father, Thomas Manley Carroll), was released free on June 21 (Father's Day) and in dedication to his late father.
On October 1, Buckethead started The Silver Shamrock Series, a Halloween-themed series in which the guitarist released one dark ambient album per day. Starting with Pike 176, 31 Days Til Halloween: Visitor From The Mirror, each subsequent album continued the countdown to Halloween's eve  culminating with Pike 206, Happy Halloween: Silver Shamrock. Buckethead's next release, 365 Days Til Halloween: Smash (released on November 1) referenced the countdown, but is not considered part of series. A physical edition of the series was released in October 2017 on a pumpkin-themed USB key that contains all 31 albums on it.
The last album of the year was Pike 219, ""Rain Drops on Christmas"". The album originally released as a free digital download on December 24 (Christmas Eve), included a dedication ""to those who lost loved ones"" in the title track.

2016–present: Continued Pikes, return to touring, and reissues
Throughout 2016, Buckethead's release output declined sharply, with only 24 albums being released. Pike 226, ""Happy Birthday MJ 23"" was released on the 53rd birthday of basketball player Michael Jordan. 2016 also saw Buckethead return to touring, after a four-year absence.
2017 saw a slight increase in pace compared to the previous year, with 30 albums being released in total. In addition, Buckethead began to repress part of his older catalogue in vinyl format, the first time in over a decade that his albums have been pressed in a physical format other than CD. Inbred Mountain, The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock, Crime Slunk Scene, Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot, Albino Slug, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie, A Real Diamond in the Rough, and Shadows Between the Sky have all been announced so far. Several reissues come in a variety of different packages, unique to each release. Some of these included signed copies, limited-edition posters or photographs, personalized recordings, among other things. As part of these reissues, the albums Albino Slug and Decoding the Tombs of Bansheebot underwent major changes with songs being re-recorded, and their album cover and title changed as well. Pike 241 ""Sparks in the Dark"" has also been announced on vinyl.
Also announced was the release of ""Bucketheadland 5-13 10-31"", an entirely new album to be released on Halloween 2017 exclusively on vinyl. It was the first album since 2012's Electric Sea not to be a part of the Pike series. In addition, Bootsy Collins announced he was working with Buckethead once again on a collaborative album set to be released in that year.
In August 2017, Buckethead announced his fall US tour would be in September and October. Buckethead played with a live band consisting of Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia on drums and Dan Monti on bass during the tour, departing from his traditional touring routine in which Buckethead was the only performer on stage. Shortly after the tour announcement, Buckethead also announced the release of ""Live from Bucketheadland"", his first live album, was released on vinyl in January 2018. Buckethead's tour continued in 2018, reverting to a solo show. Buckethead also toured in 2019 across the United States.

Influences
Buckethead cites a wide variety of musical influences, including Michael Jackson, Parliament-Funkadelic, Shawn Lane, Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Joe Satriani, Eddie Hazel, Randy Rhoads, Larry LaLonde, Mike Patton, James Cutri, Louis Johnson, Jimi Hendrix, Jennifer Batten, The Residents, Eddie Van Halen, and Angus Young as well as the many artists he has collaborated with over the years.
In addition to his musical influences, Buckethead cites a diverse range of non-musical influences, out of which dedicated songs to said inspirations have been a staple of Buckethead's discography, with  particular attention to basketball players like Michael Jordan (songs ""Jordan"" and ""Jump Man"", album ""Happy Birthday MJ 23""), George Gervin (on ""Iceman""), Blake Griffin (on ""Crack the Sky"" and ""Griffin's Spike""), ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich (on ""The Mark of Davis""), LeBron James (with four songs dedicated to him), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (album ""Kareem's Footprint""). Other influences include martial artist and actor Bruce Lee (on ""The Game of Death"" song and inspiration behind the use of nunchakus on stage), author H. P. Lovecraft (on the ""Lurker at the Threshold"" suite, and his 55th Pike, The Miskatonic Scale), numerous science fiction and horror TV shows and movies including Little House on the Prairie, Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain (on Kaleidoscalp), and Giant Robot (mentioned on several songs, albums, and episodes shown on stage). Disney and Disneyland are also major influences on Buckethead's career. Buckethead is also inspired by Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike, to whom a song on Pepper's Ghost is dedicated. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre franchise of movies is also a big inspiration to him and he has written many songs such as Jowls, which are heavily inspired by those movies. The song ""To Infinity and Beyond"" from Out Orbit was dedicated to then-recently deceased basketball reporter Craig Sager.

Burial (musician),"William Emmanuel Bevan, known by his recording alias Burial, is a British electronic musician from South London. Initially remaining anonymous, Burial became the first artist signed to Kode9's electronic label Hyperdub in 2005. He won acclaim the following year for his self-titled debut album, an influential release in the UK's dubstep scene which showcased a dark, emotive take on UK rave music styles such as UK garage and 2-step; it was named the album of the year by The Wire. Burial's second album, Untrue, was released to further critical acclaim in 2007.
In 2008, Bevan's identity was revealed by The Independent and confirmed by Hyperdub. In the following years, he went on to collaborate with artists such as Four Tet, Massive Attack, Thom Yorke, Zomby, and The Bug, in addition to releasing a series of long-form EPs such as Kindred (2012), Truant / Rough Sleeper (2012), and Rival Dealer (2013); most of these releases were later compiled on the 2019 compilation Tunes 2011–2019. He has remained reclusive, giving few interviews and avoiding public appearances. AllMusic described him as ""one of the most acclaimed, influential, and enigmatic electronic musicians of the early 21st century.""

Biography
Early career: self-titled debut and Untrue
Bevan grew up being a fan of jungle and garage, having been introduced to the UK rave scene by his older brothers. He mentioned American garage producer Todd Edwards and the UK's 2-step subgenre as favorites. In an interview with The Wire, he explained: 

I was brought up on old jungle tunes and garage tunes that had lots of vocals in but me and my brothers loved intense, darker tunes too, I found something I could believe in... but sometimes I used to listen to the ones with vocals on my own and it was almost a secret thing [...] My brother might bring back these records that seemed really adult to me and I couldn’t believe I had 'em. It was like when you first saw Terminator or Alien when you're only little. I'd get a rush from it, I was hearing this other world...
Bevan began sending Steve Goodman (Kode9) letters and CD-Rs of his home-made music around 2002, having been a fan of the music featured on Goodman's Hyperdub website. In 2005, the label released the South London Boroughs EP, which collected tracks recorded by Burial for several years prior. Burial's self-titled 2006 debut album was the first full-length release on Hyperdub.
Despite early acclaim, Burial initially remained anonymous, and said in an early interview that ""only five people know I make tunes"". In February 2008, The Independent speculated that Burial was Bevan, an alumnus of South London's Elliott School. The school's alumni also include Kieran Hebden (Four Tet), with whom Bevan has collaborated. On 22 July 2008, it was announced Burial was a nominee for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize for his second album, Untrue. There was much Mercury Prize-related coverage in tabloid newspapers in the UK, including speculation that Burial was either Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) or Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim). On 5 August 2008, Bevan confirmed his identity, and posted a picture of himself on his Myspace page. A blog entry stated, ""I'm a lowkey person and I just want to make some tunes"", as well as announcing a forthcoming four-track 12″, and thanking his fans for their support up to this point.

Post-Untrue work
Rather than releasing a third album, Burial has spent the years since Untrue releasing increasingly longer and more experimental individual tracks. This began with ""Moth"" / ""Wolf Cub"", a collaboration with Four Tet, and Burial's own track ""Fostercare"" and EP Street Halo. He developed this practice, experimenting with multi-part suites rather than conventional songs on a Massive Attack collaboration, and subsequent solo EPs Kindred (2012), Truant / Rough Sleeper (2012) and Rival Dealer (2013). Each of these EPs was met with critical acclaim, with Kindred being singled out in particular as a landmark release. Three further shorter records were released in the following years. ""Temple Sleeper"" was released on Keysound Recordings in 2015, an EP titled Young Death / Nightmarket came out in November 2016, and Subtemple / Beachfires followed in May 2017.
In 2018 Burial worked with Kode9 to compile Fabriclive 100, the final instalment of the long-running Fabriclive mix CD series. He then collaborated with The Bug on two EPs, 2018's Fog / Shrine and 2019's Dive / Rain, released under the names ""Flame 1"" and ""Flame 2"", respectively. A compilation of Burial's solo EP and single releases, Tunes 2011–2019, was released on Hyperdub at the end of 2019.
In December 2020, Burial, Four Tet, and Thom Yorke released two new songs, ""Her Revolution"" and ""His Rope"", followed by a Burial-only release, ""Chemz"". In April 2021, Burial and Blackdown released a split EP, Shock Power of Love, with two songs from each artist. The next month, the previous year's single, ""Chemz"", was given a physical release alongside the track ""Dolphinz"".
In December 2021, a new EP titled Antidawn was announced for a release in January 2022.  Another EP titled Streetlands released later the same year in October. In July 2023, Burial released the single ""Unknown Summer"", alongside Kode9's single ""Infirmary"".
In February 2024, Burial released the EP ""Dreamfear / Boy Sent From Above"" on XL Recordings.

Style and composition
AllMusic described Burial's recordings as ""gloomy, dystopian soundscapes"" which blend ""fractured breakbeats with mysterious, pitch-shifted voices and loads of vinyl crackle, rainfall, and submerged video game sound effects."" His work is inspired by British dance music such as garage, jungle, and hardcore, while his first album was one of the first prominent dubstep albums. He was associated with the mid-2000s hauntology trend, in which British artists explored elements of ""spectral"" cultural memory.

Bevan claims to compose his music in Sound Forge, a digital audio editor, and to eschew the use of trackers and sequencers. As he describes the process in an interview, ""Once I change something, I can never un-change it. I can only see the waves. So I know when I’m happy with my drums because they look like a nice fishbone. When they look just skeletal as fuck in front of me, and so I know they’ll sound good."" He also said that he didn't use a sequencer, because if his drums were timed too perfectly, they would ""lose something"" and ""sound rubbish"". Discussing his rhythmic affinities in an interview with writer Mark Fisher, Burial stated that:  Something happens when I hear the subs, the rolling drums and vocals together. To me it’s like a pure UK style of music, and I wanted to make tunes based on what UK underground hardcore tunes mean to me, and I want a dose of real life in there too, something people can relate to.
Of his production techniques, journalist Derek Walmsley wrote in The Wire:

 
Burial decided at the outset to avoid at all costs the rigid, mechanistic path that eventually brought drum 'n' bass to a standstill. To this end, his percussion patterns are intuitively arranged on the screen rather than rigidly quantized, creating minute hesitations and slippages in the rhythm. His snares and hi-hats are covered in fuzz and phaser, like cobwebs on forgotten instruments, and the mix is rough and ready rather than endlessly polished. Perhaps most importantly, his basslines sound like nothing else on Earth. Distorted and heavy, yet also warm and earthy, they resemble the balmy gust of air that precedes an underground train.Burial's music features heavily in the work of documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis. Curtis places Bevan's emotionally saturated sound within the context of a possible cultural revival of the spirit of Romanticism. Discussing the song ""Come Down to Us"", which is a prominent motif on the soundtrack of his documentary Bitter Lake, in an interview with music and pop culture magazine Dazed, Curtis lionises the piece as a work of ""genius"" going on to explain:It really sums up our time... That song is saying, it's really frightening to jump off the edge into the darkness. Both when you fall in love with someone, and when you want to change the world. And it depends whether you can live with the fear or whether you really want the thrill of it. Or whether you retreat into the world you're happy with. And I think that's why it's a work of genius. He's got it, it's the mood of our time that we're waiting for. He's way ahead of our time, an epic emotional artist.

Burial interview from BlackDownSoundBoy blog, 2006"
Burzum,"Burzum (; Norwegian: [ˈbʉ̀rtsʉm]) is a Norwegian music project founded by Varg Vikernes in 1991. Although Burzum never played live performances, it became a staple of the early Norwegian black metal scene and is considered one of the most influential acts in black metal's history. Vikernes has also released five dark ambient and neofolk albums. The word ""burzum"" means ""darkness"" in the Black Speech, a fictional language crafted by The Lord of the Rings writer J. R. R. Tolkien. Burzum's lyrics and imagery are often inspired by fantasy and Norse mythology. 
Vikernes founded Burzum in 1991 and recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993. From 1994 to 2009, Vikernes was imprisoned for the murder of Mayhem guitarist Øystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth and the arson of three churches. While imprisoned, he recorded two dark ambient albums using only synthesizers, as he had no access to drums, guitar, or bass. Since his release from prison in 2009, he has recorded several more albums. Vikernes announced the end of Burzum in 2018, but in 2024 he announced the return of Burzum on his X account with a new album named ""The Land of Thulê"".

History
Early years (1988–1992)
Varg Vikernes began making music in 1988 with the band Kalashnikov. The following year, the name was changed to Uruk-Hai, after the creatures from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In 1990 and 1991, Vikernes played guitar for the death metal band Old Funeral, which also consisted of members who would later form the band Immortal. He appears on the Old Funeral EP Devoured Carcass. Vikernes left Old Funeral in 1991 to concentrate on creating his own musical visions. He had a short-lived project called Satanel, along with Abbath Doom Occulta. He then began a solo project under the name Burzum. The word ""burzum"" means ""darkness"" in the Black Speech, a language crafted by Tolkien. Soon after recording two demo tapes, he became part of the Norwegian black metal scene. With his demo tapes, he had attracted attention from Øystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth of Mayhem, who had just recently formed Deathlike Silence Productions. Aarseth then signed Burzum to the label, and shortly after, Vikernes―under the pseudonym of Count Grishnackh (another name adapted from The Lord of the Rings)―began to record Burzum's self-titled debut album. According to Vikernes' autobiography on his website, he had intended to record the album in the worst recording quality possible (due to this being a typical trademark of the early Norwegian black metal scene), while still making it sound acceptable. Burzum's eponymous debut album was released in 1992, being the second album released on Deathlike Silence Productions. The song ""War"" from this album had a guest appearance from Euronymous, playing a guitar solo ""just for fun"", according to Vikernes.
Vikernes has stated that he had never played any live shows with Burzum, though at one point was interested in it, so Samoth of Emperor accompanied him as a session bassist, though only appearing on the Aske EP. Additionally, Erik Lancelot was hired to be the band's drummer, though did not record on any Burzum material, and along with Samoth did not play a live show. Vikernes had by then lost his interest in playing live concerts, and stated that he ""didn't even need session musicians anymore"". Therefore, Samoth and Lancelot had parted ways with Burzum. Det som engang var was released as Burzum's second album in 1993, recorded in 1992.

Imprisonment (1993–2009)
May 1994 saw the release of Hvis lyset tar oss, a new album of previously recorded material from 1992. Burzum remained as a solo project until 1994, when Vikernes was arrested for the murder of Euronymous and the burnings of several churches in Norway. During his time in prison, Vikernes released his next album, titled Filosofem, on 1 January 1996. Recorded in March 1993, Filosofem was the last recording Vikernes made before his imprisonment. Burzum / Aske, a compilation comprising the Burzum album and Aske EP, was released in 1995. While imprisoned, Vikernes managed to record two other albums in a dark ambient style. They were released as Dauði Baldrs (1997) and Hliðskjálf (1999). Both of these albums were created with a synthesizer, as Vikernes was prohibited from using any other instruments in prison.
In 1998, all Burzum albums released up to that point were re-released as vinyl picture discs in a special box set called 1992–1997; however Filosofem did not contain ""Rundtgåing av den transcendentale egenhetens støtte"" due to its length. The regular vinyl issue of Filosofem on Misanthropy had tracks 1–4 plus ""Decrepitude II"" on side 1 and ""Rundtgåing av den transcendentale egenhetens støtte"" on side 2.

Post-imprisonment, retirement and return (2009–2020, 2023-2024)
Soon after being released, Vikernes started writing new tracks (nine metal tracks and an ambient intro and outro) for an upcoming Burzum album. According to Vikernes' recounts, several record companies were interested in releasing his first album in eleven years. He stated about the new album, ""I want to take my time, and make it the way I want it. It will be metal, and the fans can expect genuine Burzum.""
The album was going to be originally titled Den hvite guden (The White God), but he later decided to change it to Belus, which was released by the independent record label Byelobog Productions (byelobog is the transliteration of ""белобог"" in Slavic languages, meaning 'white god') on 8 March 2010. It was also announced that a movie would be released in 2010, based on Varg Vikernes' life in the early 1990s. The movie would mainly draw inspiration from the book Lords of Chaos, with the film being of the same name. Vikernes expressed his contempt towards both the movie and the book upon which it is based.
A second new album of original Burzum material, Fallen, was released on 7 March 2011, followed by a compilation album, From the Depths of Darkness, containing re-recordings of tracks from Burzum's self-titled album and Det som engang var, on 28 November 2011. A third new studio album of original material, titled Umskiptar, was released in May 2012. Sôl austan, Mâni vestan (""East of the Sun, West of the Moon""), Burzum's first electronic album since 1999, was released in May 2013. On 27 April 2013, a song was posted on the official YouTube channel of Vikernes, titled ""Back to the Shadows"". In a blog post, Vikernes stated that ""Back to the Shadows"" would be the last metal track released by Burzum. Another album, The Ways of Yore, was released in June 2014.
After a period of inactivity, Vikernes posted a video on his YouTube account in June 2018 announcing that ""[he had] moved on [from Burzum]"", saying ""bye bye"" to the project.
In July 2018, a YouTube user named Hermann posted unreleased materials of Uruk-Hai from 1988 to 1990 and Burzum's Bergen prison recordings from 1994, which he received from Tiziana Stupia.
In October 2019, Vikernes posted a tweet saying he intended to release another album as Burzum. He announced that the tentative name of the album would be Thulêan Mysteries, which would have 23 songs. The tracks from the album were previously used as background music on Vikernes' YouTube channel, which was taken down the same year. Vikernes also said that the music of Thulêan Mysteries is meant to be used as a background soundtrack for his MYFAROG role-playing game. On 18 December, Vikernes tweeted the album cover for Thulêan Mysteries and announced its release date as 13 March 2020. Vikernes has stated it would be Burzum's last album at the time.
On 8th September 2023, Vikernes released a new song as Burzum called ""The Reincarnation of Ódinn"".
In April 2024, Vikernes announced the return of the project on his X account, with a new album titled ""The Land of Thulê"". It is the first metal album since Umskiptar.

Musical style
Burzum's music includes both straightforward black metal as well as dark ambient, neofolk and neo-medieval music. It is often minimalist and dark, with repetition and simple song structures. Vikernes has described Burzum as a kind of ""spell"" or recreation of an imaginary world tied in with Pagan history. Each album, he claims, was designed as a kind of ""spell"" in itself, with each beginning song intending to make the listener more susceptible to ""magic"", the following songs to inspire a ""trance-like state of mind"", and the last song to carry the listener into a ""world of fantasy"" (dreams, for the listener would fall asleep—Burzum was supposed to have been evening music). Vikernes claims the intent to create this fantasy world came from dissatisfaction with the real world. He has stated the ""message"" of Burzum can be found in the lyrics of the first song of the first album (""Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown"").
Burzum's lyrics and imagery are often inspired by fantasy and Norse mythology, and do not feature the far-right political views for which Vikernes is known. In a 2010 interview, Vikernes said: ""Burzum is not a political or religious band, or even an anti-religious band. Burzum is music; art if you like, and the interpretation of art lies in the eye of the beholder. I might be Nordic, heterosexual and have a Pagan ideology myself, but why would I expect the fans of my music to be just like me?"". Despite the project's apolitical nature, Burzum is included on Meta's Dangerous Individuals and Organizations list.
Burzum's early work was influenced by Tolkien; for example, Vikernes' early moniker ""Count Grishnackh"" is taken from an orc character called Grishnákh in Tolkien's works. Burzum is a word of the Black Speech of Mordor meaning ""darkness"" (though Vikernes views what Christians consider ""darkness"" as ""light""), and is inscribed on the One Ring in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

Influences and legacy
Vikernes said that the German thrash metal band Destruction ""changed my approach towards playing my instrument"" despite having only discovered them in 1991. In a 1996 interview with Terrorizer, Vikernes also named Bathory's Blood Fire Death and Celtic Frost's Morbid Tales as significant influences on Burzum. He credited Dead Can Dance's Within the Realm of a Dying Sun for being one of Burzum's first non-metal influences. In 2011, Vikernes said that he no longer kept up with new black metal bands and listened mostly to The Cure instead.
Burzum is widely considered to be the most influential act in black metal history. Bands that have listed Burzum as an influence include Deafheaven, Liturgy, and Altar of Plagues. The project has also inspired musicians from other genres, including Chelsea Wolfe, Mount Eerie, Thurston Moore, Anna von Hausswolff, Grimes,, Vision Eternel, Sleigh Bells, and Kanye West.

C418,"Daniel Rosenfeld (born 9 May 1989), better known as C418 (pronounced ""see four eighteen""), is a German musician, producer and sound engineer, best known as the former composer and sound designer for the sandbox video game Minecraft. He has also written and produced the theme for Beyond Stranger Things and the soundtrack for the Steam release of Cookie Clicker. He has also DJed for American rock band Anamanaguchi. 
Rosenfeld's music has received acclaim for its nostalgic value and relaxing quality. In August 2023, he was ranked at #1 on Billboard magazine's emerging artist's chart.

Life and career
Rosenfeld was born in East Germany on 9 May 1989, the son of a Soviet-born father of German descent working as a goldsmith and a German mother. He learned to create music on early versions of Schism Tracker (a popular clone of Impulse Tracker) and Ableton Live in the early 2000s, both rudimentary tools at the time. It was his brother, Harry Rosenfeld, who introduced him to music composition through Impulse Tracker, commenting that ""even an idiot"" can successfully create music with it. His brother was also known as C818, from which he chose the name C418, claiming that the name is ""really cryptic and doesn't actually mean anything."" Rosenfeld has also stated that he was ""mediocre at school,"" but learning basic music theory and English came easy to him.

2002–2009: Career beginnings
After being introduced to music production by his brother, Rosenfeld started releasing music on Bandcamp after Danny Baranowsky suggested releasing his music on the site.
In 2007, Rosenfeld started a blog known as ""Blödsinn am Mittwoch"" (English: ""Silliness on Wednesday""), where he posted a new song every week. This was around the same time when he became interested in game development and audio, which resulted in him joining the indie game development forum TIGSource, where he became involved with numerous smaller games and game developers (among them, Rosenfeld unofficially released the soundtracks of Zombie Dog in Crazyland and Mubbly Tower on his site and old blog). Later, Rosenfeld started making albums and releasing them on the blog and also Bandcamp, as a hobby.
His first release was the 2007 EP BPS, and shortly thereafter, in 2008, he challenged himself to make a studio album as quickly as possible, for fun, prioritizing quantity over quality, The Whatever Director's Cut was released on his blog as BAM #30 and on his Bandcamp, where it was available until it was removed in 2013, due to Rosenfeld's dislike of the album.
Also in 2008, Rosenfeld released Mixes, a 25-minute medley containing remixes of songs previously posted on the blog, also were released the EP Sine, and his second studio album Zweitonegoismus, the album expressed his feelings working in an assembly line factory. Rosenfeld showed the album to his co-worker prior to releasing it, in which they asked ""why the hell [he was] still working there"".

2009–2013: Minecraft, becoming a freelance composer, and One
In early 2009, Rosenfeld began collaborating with the Minecraft creator Markus ""Notch"" Persson through an internet forum called TIGSource. Rosenfeld was responsible for the sound effects and music in Persson's work-in-progress video game Minecraft. The sound engine in the still young Java game was not very powerful, so Rosenfeld had to be creative in his approach to creating sound effects and music.
In January 2010, fourth studio album A Cobblers Tee Thug, a collaborative work with Rosenfeld's friend Sohnemann was released. Made in the few days they spent together in the New Year, and they challenged each other, for fun, to make a full-length LP together in those days.

The album circle was released in March 2010, originally created in 2008, it was intended as the soundtrack for an unpublished indie game bearing the same name, created by an unknown developer.
In August 2010, Rosenfeld released Life Changing Moments Seem Minor in Pictures. The album was recorded while Rosenfeld was still residing within Germany, and at the time of releasing the album, Rosenfeld was requested to work for military services after quitting his job, in which he instead did other labour. The album also contains the original soundtrack to Ezo, a game Rosenfeld independently developed for Ludum Dare.
In 2011 a series of compilation albums with songs from various projects were released on Bandcamp for free, including Little Things, I Forgot Something, Didn't I. (a B-side to 72 Minutes of Fame), and Seven Years of Server Data.
While still working on Minecraft as a freelance artist, Rosenfeld was not on staff at Mojang Studios, the company behind Minecraft. Rosenfeld still owns the rights to all his music in the game, and has released two albums featuring songs from the Minecraft soundtrack. The first soundtrack, Minecraft – Volume Alpha, was digitally released on 4 March 2011 on his Bandcamp page.
Later that year, when Minecraft became available to the general public as an early access title, it rapidly became popular. Rosenfeld, who up until that point had worked at an assembly line for a company in Stollberg, could now pursue music as his primary source of income. This inspired his 2011 studio album, 72 Minutes of Fame. The content of this album mostly revolves around this lifestyle-defining moment in Rosenfeld's life. This album was the first of Rosenfeld's works to have a (limited) physical release. The Guardian has compared his compositions to those of Brian Eno and Erik Satie because of their minimalistic, ambient quality.
Almost half a year later, production on a documentary of the development of Minecraft started, titled Minecraft: The Story of Mojang. Rosenfeld was requested to create the soundtrack for this documentary, which was included on his 2012 album, One.

2013–2016: Minecraft - Volume Beta, 0x10c, and other independent projects
On 9 November 2013, Rosenfeld released the second album of the official soundtrack for Minecraft, titled Minecraft - Volume Beta. Many of the new songs were being added into features of the game that were not present when the first batch of music was produced; i.e. the Nether or the End. In 2020, the soundtrack was released in physical format with Ghostly International and reprints of the Minecraft - Volume Alpha physical releases were also released. The Volume Beta releases consisted of a double CD edition of the album, a vinyl record which came in black and a red ""fire"" splatter color, and a limited edition of the vinyl pressed on a magenta translucent material which was at first exclusive to Europe but was later re-pressed internationally.
Persson and Rosenfeld worked together again after Minecraft's success on the creation of a new game, titled 0x10c. The game was never released, with Persson halting production indefinitely in August 2013.
In 2014, Rosenfeld released an EP containing the music made for 0x10c. It was released digitally with little publicity; Rosenfeld only sent out a tweet saying that it was available.
In 2015, Rosenfeld released 148, which much like 72 Minutes of Fame carried a significant amount of personal content, albeit slightly more hidden under lyrics and effects.
Later that year, Minecraft - Volume Alpha soundtrack was released on a physical format on Ghostly International. This release consisted of a regular CD edition of the album, a vinyl edition which came with a code for a digital copy of the album, and a limited edition of the album pressed on green translucent vinyl.
In the same year, Rosenfeld hinted at a potential upcoming third album for Minecraft's soundtrack, stating ""I'll still work on Minecraft, so there’ll probably be another album"". In 2017, Rosenfeld confirmed the future release, claiming the album is ""still far from done"".

2016–2021: 2 Years of Failure, Excursions, and further independent music
Rosenfeld released 2 Years of Failure in 2016, a Bandcamp exclusive compilation album of music made for failed projects or songs that could not fit anywhere else. Several songs in this album were made for an abandoned game Rosenfeld described as having a ""...Japanese puzzle exchange..."" vibe. This album also contains the original soundtrack for Crayon Physics. Most notably, this album contains C418's remix of the Stranger Things theme song, which had staggering popularity in 2018. It was the most played song on Rosenfeld's personal SoundCloud page until it was removed along with several other tracks due to a lapsed SoundCloud Pro subscription.
He released Dief in 2017. The songs of this album were created and used as a soundtrack for an informative talk given at the Game Developers Conference 2017 by Teddy Dief.
After the ""Update Aquatic"" Minecraft update of 2018, three new songs were added to the game as underwater music. These songs – ""Dragon Fish"", ""Shuniji"", ""Axolotl"" – were released by Rosenfeld respectively on 9 August, 10 November, and 12 December 2018, on Spotify as singles. All of them are to be included in the third album. Rosenfeld confirmed on Twitter that the third album will not be called ""Minecraft: Volume Gamma"" following the pattern from the 2 Minecraft albums before it.
On 20 July 2018, Rosenfeld announced a studio album, Excursions, with the release of its lead single, ""Beton"". Its second single, ""Thunderbird"", was released on 20 August 2018. The album was released on 7 September 2018. Multiple tracks on Excursions are named after cafes in Austin, Texas, where Rosenfeld currently lives as of 2017.
Excursions was released on CD and a limited vinyl LP by Driftless Recordings in January 2019 and reprinted in 2021 for CD and Vinyl.
In 2020, after the announcement of the addition of Steve to the game, his work was not included in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for various undisclosed reasons, though one explanation given was it being too calm for fighting. Tracks other composers made for Minecraft Legacy Console Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth were added instead.
During an interview in January 2021 with Anthony Fantano, when asked if a potential third installment in the soundtrack was in the works, Rosenfeld responded with ""I have something, I consider it finished, but things have become complicated especially as Minecraft is now a big property. So I don't know"".
In May 2021, Rosenfeld released Branching Out. The EP contains the soundtrack to Branch, a video conferencing software by Dayton Mills.

2021–present: Life Changing Moments Seem Minor in Pictures remaster, Ivy Road and Cookie Clicker
On 16 June 2021, Rosenfeld announced on Twitter that his album from 11 years prior, Life Changing Moments Seem Minor in Pictures would be remastered and released onto major streaming platforms. The album prior to the re-release was only available on Bandcamp.
In July 2021, Rosenfeld, along with Davey Wreden, Karla Zimonja and Annapurna Interactive announced the launch of Ivy Road, a game studio founded by Wreden and co-founded by Zimonja. The studio is working on an untitled game, which Rosenfeld is composing the music for.
Following the announcement of the launch of Ivy Road, in August 2021 Rosenfeld announced that he had worked on a soundtrack for the 2013 game Cookie Clicker as it was being released onto Steam. In September 2021, Rosenfeld released the soundtrack.
On 13 March 2022, Rosenfeld performed a DJ set with Anamanaguchi for their Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game Soundtrack tour.
In August 2022, Northway Games released I Was a Teenage Exocolonist. Rosenfeld and other fellow musical artists collaborated in composing the soundtrack to the game. His contribution was the piece ""Quiet.""

Carbon Based Lifeforms,"Carbon Based Lifeforms is a Swedish electronic music duo formed in Gothenburg in 1996 by Johannes Hedberg and Daniel Vadestrid (né Ringström and formerly Segerstad).

History
Formation and early period
Hedberg and Ringström (both born in 1976) first met in 1991 when they were 15 years old, after the former was transferred to the same class as Ringström. They became friends, and shared similar tastes in music, films, and video games. They started collaborating on the music tracker sequencer software Protracker and later, the Amiga computer system. In 1994, they started to work with PCs and formed a music tracker trio with fellow Swedish musician and producer Mikael Lindqvist called Bassment Studios. In the following year, they moved once more to MIDI-oriented music and formed Notch, a group focusing on acid, techno, and house music. Their first track was a remix of ""What Would You Think"" by synthpop group Mourning After.
Lindqvist soon parted ways and Notch discontinued, but encouraged Hedberg and Ringström to continue recording their own music. The pair had started to fully explore ambient music after Hedberg's sister had picked up Orgship (1994) by Solar Quest, which quickly became a favourite of theirs and influenced the two to make similar music. Electronic bands The Future Sound of London and Boards of Canada were also a big influence on them; Vadestrid called them ""our role models"". After initial tracks were put together still under their Notch moniker, the duo wished to explore the genre further by incorporating drone and chill out elements. This led to the formation of their own identity, Carbon Based Lifeforms, in 1996, initially as a side project. They named themselves after a Notch demo album, and thought it fitted ""with our underlying themes of the combination of biology and technology, also it alludes to a lot of sci-fi concepts.""
The band had built a following as Notch on MP3.com and Last.fm, but accumulated a bigger one as Carbon Based Lifeforms which led to increased exposure from radio airplay. When Last.fm switched from Winamp to another media player, the band saw a boost in traffic which also increased their income. Much of their music from their early period relied on delay and filter effects, and simpler sounds than their later tracks.

Signing with Ultimae and studio albums
In 2002, the band signed a record deal with French label Ultimae Records after the label discovered them on MP3.com. Vadestrid said that the deal boosted their profile as a result, and the band started to perform at trance festivals during a time where it was uncommon for ambient acts to be on the big stage. Hedberg called the group's early years as ""rough"" partly due to his fear of flying which he did not conquer until 2009, which left Vadestrid to often perform abroad by himself, sometimes accompanied with a live musician. The group's first live gigs took place in 2004. Vadestrid chose their performance at the 2006 Ozora Festival in Hungary as ""something special"" as the gig took place during a thunderstorm.
Their debut studio album, Hydroponic Garden, was released in 2003, followed by World of Sleepers in 2006. Vadestrid chose ""Photosynthesis"" from the latter as a track that contains all of the band's ""key components"". Released in 2010, Interloper was the album the group recalled as the turning point where they ""grew big"" as an act, and look back on the it as their defining moment. The follow-up, 2011's Twentythree, was originally finished in 2009 without beats, but the group became doubtful and self-critical about it and withheld its release. After discussing it with Ultimae, they produced a version with beats and put it out after Interloper.
After about ten years with Ultimae, the band departed from the label to focus on digital releases and to achieve greater control over their music. They formed their own label, Leftfield Records, to handle the digital releases. In 2014, the band were approached by Blood Music which led to a record deal to release their albums on CD and for the first time, on vinyl, with updated artwork, leaving the band to handle the digital releases themselves. They had not released their albums on vinyl before because Ultimae were ""too busy to bother"" about the format, and that there was not a big enough demand. In 2015, the band remastered their first three studio albums with the aim of getting ""a more coherent sound between them"", and for bringing out more details in the music. Also that year, the band revealed that Spotify is their top source of income.
In 2017, the band released their first studio album in six years, Derelicts. They made the conscious decision to take elements from their first three albums that they enjoyed the most and develop new tracks from those ideas. It marked a development in their sound, as by now, they were almost exclusively working with hardware-based instruments and setups which gave the record a lo-fi quality. The album marked the band's first official music video release, for the track ""Accede"". Stochastic was released in 2021, and originated when the group started to test random functions on some old synthesisers, which produced musical ideas suited for ""passive listening whilst not stealing focus."" It developed further during lockdowns amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, during which both members started producing tracks separately. They agreed to explore drone music and developed tracks by exchanging files online and adding to what the other member had put down.
Their seventh studio album, Seeker, was released in June 2023. With the pandemic dying down, the group reunited and worked on music that, unlike the origins of Stochastic, had a more unified direction. This was followed by the band's first live album, Live at Ozora 2022, which features the band performing with a live drummer, guitarist, and bassist.

Other projects
From 2007 to 2020, the pair released music as their electropop outfit, Thermostatic.
In March 2022, Vadestrid announced that he had completed the first draft of a book about the history of the band. Its working title is The Path to Derelicts.

Carl Weingarten,"Carl Weingarten is an American guitarist, photographer, and founder of the independent music label Multiphase Records. He is best known for his atmospheric sound and use of the slide guitar and Dobro. Weingarten has played a significant role in progressive underground music for over 40 years, recording several solo and collaborative instrumental albums and signing various musicians to his label.

Biography
Before acquiring a taste in music, Weingarten gained an interest in photography early on; at seven years old, he received his first camera as a Christmas gift. By junior high, Weingarten moved on to shooting Super 8 films, and was awarded two Honorable Mentions in the Kodak Teenage Movie Awards. However, in high school, he also aspired to teach himself how to play slide guitar after his first exposure to blues.
Weingarten later earned a degree in cinema production which would go hand in hand with the atmospheric music he would later become known for. According to Weingarten, ""The cinematic tone in my music comes from my visual arts background. I try to paint it all in sound."" However, breaking into the film industry proved difficult in the mid-west, and he began writing and recording his own film scores and other music for modern dance companies. This led him to join the indie label movement.
Weingarten founded Multiphase Records in St. Louis in 1980. The following year, he released its first album, Submergings, in collaboration with Gale Ormiston and Phil Neon. That same year gave birth to Weingarten's instrumental electronic rock band Delay Tactics. The group, featuring Walter Whitney on synths and guitarists David Udell and Reed Nesbit, took heavy influence from Robert Fripp and served as more of a recording unit than live act. They were, however, among the first of such indie groups to use digital delays in both studio recordings and live looping performances. With two albums under their belt, the group disbanded in 1986. The members regrouped in 2016 and a third record, Elements of Surprise (MP-CD127) was released in 2023.
In the 1990s, Weingarten moved to San Francisco and continued producing his own solo and collaboration albums and toured. He reunited multiple times with Walter Whitney among other musicians in producing a broad catalog of studio recordings. In 1995, several musicians were brought together under the Court Musicians moniker to record an album fusing various cultural styles; two of such tracks featured Weingarten on guitar, and his experience with the project's Indian themes had a profound influence on him musically. He has more recently moved to Alameda, California and continued releasing new music throughout the 2000s.
Weingarten's records have received praise by media outlets such as All About Jazz, Muze.com, Music Web Express, Exposé magazine, and AllMusic among others. With influences spanning Ennio Morricone, Brian Eno, Antonio Vivaldi, and Robert Johnson among others, his albums have often been described as sounding more akin to a thematic soundtrack than a more formal collection of songs, and his innovative style blending and experimentation have been widely commended. In 2002, Weingarten released one of his most critically acclaimed works, escapesilence. The record would become an NPR staple and the winner of the ""Listeners Choice Award"" from the syndicated PRI program Echoes.
Despite his success in the music industry, Weingarten is still an avid photographer. Today, a gallery of photos can be viewed at his website focusing on subjects like urban landscapes and architecture, natural landscapes, concerts, and nightlife. The site also offers digital restoration of old photos, and his work has been featured in exhibits such as the Frank Bette Center for the Arts.

Cat System Corp.,"Jornt Elzinga (born 1989), commonly known as Cat System Corp. (Japanese: 猫 シ Corp., Hepburn: Neko Shi Corp.), is a Dutch musician regarded as a vaporwave figure that originated the mallsoft subgenre. He also previously recorded as Mesektet for his dark ambient releases.
Born in 1989, Elzinga started his music career in the 2000s with drone and noise productions. He began his independent vaporwave career in 2013, and became popular in the scene with his 2014 album Hiraeth. His solo works, including albums such as Palm Mall (2014), Cosmopolitan Dreams (2016), and News at 11 (2016), are known for popularising mallsoft. His collaborations with other musicians also spawned successful albums within the community, including Corporate Mixtape (2014) and Building a Better World (2019).
Elzinga's music explores concepts of late 20th century capitalism, presenting ambient shopping center recordings characteristic of mallsoft. It also portrays specific events, such as an alternate history where the September 11 attacks never happened, or a fictional soundtrack to a retro fashion TV series. In 2019, he founded his own record label, Hiraeth Records. He is one of the best-selling mallsoft artists as of 2022.

Life and career
Early life and the September 11 attacks (1989–2001)
Jornt Elzinga was born in the Netherlands on 3 March 1989. He was influenced by the pop culture of the 1990s and the early 2000s, saying he ""witnessed the world's globalization and grew up with slow dial-up Internet."" His sister watched TV shows such as Saved by the Bell, which Jornt called ""a childhood memory that has been in my mind forever."" His dad frequently filmed and took photos as a kid; as Jornt said, ""most of my memories from the early 90s are documented.""
On 11 September 2001, as Jornt did French homework, his mother desperately called for him to watch the September 11 attacks on TV. In an interview with YouTuber Pad Chennington, Jornt said that although confused, he found the experience surreal, saying ""On that date, I think the old world died. You know, that peaceful... world, that American Dream world."" The event would greatly influence his future music career; he further explained:

""We have not and will never forget about what happened that day. I like to think there's a parallel universe where it never happened.""

Early music and discovery of vaporwave (2001–2013)
By his mid-teens and with faster access to the Internet, Elzinga discovered more of what he called ""weird music,"" including dark ambient, drone, and noise. He experimented with stretching, field recording, and sampling to create a more narrative feel to his music, as well as transferring his recordings to cassette tape. For releases such as Towards a Bleak Sun (2014), Elzinga recorded under the alias Mesektet.
In 2013, Elzinga wanted to release music on floppy disk but did not know how to do so; searching on Google, he discovered Miami Vice's lofi release Culture Island (2012), an album released on that format. Elzinga revealed he listened exclusively to vaporwave after initially discovering it; he wanted to start producing it but ""had no idea where to start,"" as he did not have previous knowledge of genres sampled, such as jazz and R&B.
Elzinga wanted to choose an alias name involving cats, and stated that ""Corporation"" fits the themes he would pursue with his music. He continuously translated names through Google Translate until it read ""Cat System Corp."" (猫 シ Corp.), a name he found ""genius.""

Mallsoft releases and collaborations (2014–2016)
Elzinga's first successful album, Hiraeth (2014), established him as a vaporwave musician and showed the early internet culture of his youth within what The Outline's Emma Madden called the ""ahistorical placelessness"" of vaporwave. It was one of the best-selling vaporwave albums worldwide until July 2014, being called by Bandcamp Daily's Simon Chandler ""one of [Elzinga's] standout albums"" and by VWMusic's Andrew Daly an influential release on the scene. Late Night Stereo, released in June 2014, was Elzinga's next release, and ""just missed the cut"" of Fact's listing of July's ""essential cassette releases.""
Elzinga's next solo album, Palm Mall, was released in late 2014. It was one of the best-selling vaporwave albums worldwide in October 2014 and became Elzinga's most well-known music release, being called a ""particularly atmospheric"" album by author Samuel Cothron.
In 2014, Elzinga collaborated with anonymous musician Telepath on the album Blue Dream, whose musical style was once described as ""washed out euphoria"" by a reviewer. He also produced Corporate Mixtape with artist Donovan Hikaru in 2015, where he explores futuristic working soundscapes, and created a remix of Luxury Elite's ""Strut"" for her album World Class.

News at 11 and further success (2016–2019)
On 11 September 2016, Elzinga released News at 11, a concept album about the September 11 attacks. The album's number of tracks coincides with the term ""9/11""; Side A has 9 tracks, while Side B has 11 tracks. It was recognised within the vaporwave community due to its conceptualisation of 9/11 and exploration of tragedy. It  is the second best-selling mallsoft release of all time on Bandcamp, while its October 2021 cassette reissue is considered an ""increased demand"" product of independent record label Lost Angles.
In 2017, Elzinga collaborated on Memories Overlooked, a tribute release for the Caretaker alias and his album series Everywhere at the End of Time (2016–2019). The album cover of A Class in...' Crypto Currency (2018) was used in an art piece sold as an NFT. Palm Mall Mars, released in 2018, was Elzinga's first mallsoft album to be set on Mars.

Hiraeth Records and Building a Better World (2019–present)
In early 2019, Elzinga founded his own record label, Hiraeth Records, which made him stop releasing sampled music due to copyright concerns. He was influenced by media such as the Hyperion Cantos and The Matrix (1999), and shifted his focus towards ambient-oriented music. Artists whose works were released on the label include Disconscious, Zer0, and Tsudio Studio. Later that year, Elzinga's video album of his 2018 release Family. Work. Shop. was exhibited at Brazilian film event Ecrã Festival in Rio de Janeiro.
In July 2019, Elzinga released Building a Better World, a collaboration with anonymous musician Telepath. It was Elzinga's first Telepath collaborative release in three years, and the first album released on Hiraeth Records. It was included on Bandcamp's ""essential"" ambient listing, being included among works by artists such as Aphex Twin and William Basinski. German metal band Dune described it as creating ""these lush atmospheres that evoke some strong imagery of isolation.""

Impact
Elzinga has been a recognised musician within the vaporwave scene for his contributions to mallsoft. Albums such as Hiraeth, Corporate Mixtape, and Palm Mall were praised for their portrayals of 20th-century shopping malls, with Palm Mall being called the definitive mallsoft release and ""one of the greatest vaporwave albums of all time."" Of Oasys, Jeffrey Howard stated that the album ""might save your life, transporting you back to a time when George W. Bush was in office."" News at 11, one of the most demanded physical releases within the vaporwave scene, was described by author Roisin Kiberd as a concept album that ""interrogates vaporwave, asking if the genre can only be truly appreciated by those who have lost something.""

Artistry
Influences
Elzinga was influenced by artists including Architecture in Tokyo, Luxury Elite, Macintosh Plus, and Telepath. Although he said Architecture in Tokyo and Luxury Elite had an influence on him, calling them ""the OGs,"" Telepath is Elzinga's favorite, as both worked together on several albums. One musician he listened to frequently in 2013 is Toyotaセリカ; although more inactive than others, Elzinga said, ""he has some amazing albums."" One specific artist sampled on Elzinga's first releases is singer Sade, whose song ""Tar Baby"" was also sampled on Floral Shoppe.
Video games and films had a lasting influence on Elzinga's music as well. Games such as Grand Theft Auto V (2013) partly inspired him to produce Palm Mall, while films and TV shows such as Vanilla Sky (2001) and The Walking Dead motivated the narrative aspects of and were sampled on his music. In one of his albums, Elzinga included a sample from The Last of Us (2013); according to him in 2018, only one person had ever found it. Black Mesa Research Facility (2017), a collaboration with musician Mezzaluna, was Elzinga's first release to be themed around a video game, Half-Life.

Musicianship
Elzinga initially produced music with Adobe Premiere and later transitioned into FL Studio, with the consideration of using electronic drums for his live performances. He recalled that News at 11 took nine months to produce, and that Shopping @ Helsinki was his first album to feature original mall recordings. He stated that his origin country, the Netherlands, has smaller-sized shopping centers, which led him to a desire to visualise American-styled malls in his albums.
Elzinga admitted not having any formal music education and not being able to write or read musical notation. Although featuring instruments such as saxophones in many of his songs, he only samples existing 1980s and 90s jazz. He said he began his music career selecting specific ambient works, stating that ""everyone can make it."" Referencing Floral Shoppe, he jokingly said, ""It's only slowed down Diana Ross, right?""
About his collaborative process, Elzinga maintains contact with many other vaporwave musicians, including Luxury Elite and Vaperror. He produced albums such as Building a Better World with Telepath by continuously emailing audio files to each other, similarly to the production process of 2814's Rain Temple (2016).

Music and genres
Genres explored by Elzinga's music include vaporwave, mallsoft, lofi,  smooth jazz, and ambient. Palm Mall features two widely differing sides: the ambient sounds of the first 20 minutes are featured in one single eponymous track, while the last 20 minutes present tracks with lengths closer to traditional vaporwave albums. Elzinga's Bandcamp page includes visual influences of synthwave and chillwave, such as pastel colors and pixel art palm trees. Regarding album covers, writer Estivalet Raymundo noted that the artwork for Palm Mall represented Elzinga's portrayal of ""the mall"" as a flawless but false space. The cover of 2016's Cosmopolitan Dreams continued this trend, of which Simon Chandler stated, ""since the images are often computer-generated and artificial, ... this sense of limitlessness is a fantasy.""

With Palm Mall, Elzinga ""constructed ... a virtual soundscape of visiting the mall"" with tracks such as ""Special Discount"" and ""First Floor"", according to Paul Ballam-Cross of the Journal of Popular Music Studies. To critic Miguel Principe, the album's 20-minute-long eponymous track ""simulates a walk through a mall,"" giving it a ""background feel"" that differs from other mallsoft releases. With Oasys (2015), writer Jeffrey Howard commented that Elzinga developed the alias ""from a warm and grainy sound to a cold and cacophonous one."" In 2015's Class of '84, Elzinga portrays a 1980s graduation classroom, while Sandrawave (2016) samples exclusively from works by German singer Sandra. Shopping @ Helsinki directs an elevator music style as opposed to melancholic feelings, and was highlighted by researchers for this, along with Palm Mall and Oasys.
In News at 11, Elzinga's vision of 9/11 draws mainly from 1980s and 90s smooth jazz songs. The Weather Channel tracks compose the latter half of the album, of which Elzinga at one point in production had a five-hour-long playlist. Most of the beginning tracks are interspersed with TV broadcast clips from the morning before the attacks, ranging from CarMax commercials in ""Financial News"", a recording of The Today Show in ""Downtown"", and Good Morning America on the opener of the same name.
In Lofi (2017), Elzinga shows a more lofi-oriented direction to his music, while Luxury Girls (2017) explores 90s retro fashion interspersed with interview clips to create a fictional soundtrack of a typical TV show from the time. Palm Mall Mars serves as a ""sequel"" to the original Palm Mall, and was Elzinga's last mallsoft release. The visual version of Family. Work. Shop. was filmed on cassette, and features original recordings from Elzinga. Building a Better World creates an atmosphere of optimism that Poppel Yang of Chinese website Biede described as a less dystopian version of 2814's Birth of a New Day (2015). The album's title track is composed of a rhythm that at times focuses on certain elements of the ambiance, which Bandcamp Daily's Ari Delaney felt created ""the perfect soundtrack for a neon metropolis.""

Centrozoon,"centrozoon (sometimes incorrectly capitalized as Centrozoon) is a German electronic improvisational music group. The core members are Markus Reuter (Warr touch guitar, loops, programming) and Bernhard Wöstheinrich (synthesizers, electronic percussion, programming). The group's music is flexible and has altered from album to album, but frequently-used elements include ambient music, improvisation, electronica, progressive rock and IDM (intelligent dance music).
While most of the centrozoon recordings have been made by the duo of Reuter and Wöstheinrich, the group has on two occasions expanded to a formal trio - the first featuring No-Man singer Tim Bowness for a set of vocal and song-based projects, the second featuring multi-instrumentalist Tobias Reber. The group has also collaborated with King Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto, engineer Bill Munyon and a variety of remixers.

History
Formation
Markus Reuter was a former student of Robert Fripp's Guitar Craft, studying with Fripp and Tony Geballe. Initially trained as a pianist and a student of contemporary classical music (with Karlheinz Straetmanns and Daniel Schell, plus Indian music with Ashok Pathak), he had switched to guitar in the late 1980s and to touch guitar in 1993 (initially Chapman Stick and subsequently Warr Guitar).  At around the same time, he had developing an interest in textural loop music. Reuter had also been a member of the Europa String Choir and String Unit.
In the mid-1990s, Reuter met Bernhard Wöstheinrich, an experimental electronic musician playing various synthesizers and electronic rhythm devices. The two began to collaborate as centrozoon in early 1996.

Early albums: Blast and Sun Lounge Debris (1999–2001)
The first centrozoon album was the predominantly-ambient Blast, which was released on DiN Recordings in 1999. Reviewing the disc, ambient radio station Star's End commented ""the duo of centrozoon produce spacemusic difficult to quantify, trace or categorize; their distinguishing characteristic being improvisation… Blast speaks to the listener with a musical vocabulary of contrasting harmonies and remarkable timbres… an album that is at once experimental, cerebral, spacious and engaging. Blast creates its own space, colored by the listener's imagination."" A remastered version of the album was released nearly a decade later in 2008, featuring an extra track (""Power"").
Blast was followed by Sun Lounge Debris, a collection of pieces of a varying nature, initially issued on British art-rock label Burning Shed in 2001 as a CD-R release. Allmusic noted the album's ""ambient-inspired depths, with slowly progressing songs that unfold with layers of haunting, lovely drones that sound like soft sighs"" and commented on the ""definite hints of prog-tinged exploration throughout... Reuter's a very deliberate player, and his skill at creating loops out of his performances establishes the shade and beautiful texture of the pieces. Wöstheinrich's work is subtle throughout, providing low-key accompaniment and melody to the performances, working in gentle sync with Reuter.""

The dance phase: The Divine Beast centrophil and The Cult Of: Bibiboo (late 2001–2002)
Early hints of what the next centrozoon album would be like (denser and faster, with strong electronic dance-rhythms incorporated) were circulated later in 2001 on a CD EP called The Divine Beast.The first centrozoon release of 2002 was the self-released Centrophil 12-inch vinyl EP, in which the band explored electronic remix culture in collaboration with electronic musician and producer Philipp Quaet-Faslem (who would remain a frequent collaborator). Later in the year, the third centrozoon album The Cult Of: Bibiboo, was released on Burning Shed as a full CD issue. This revealing a much more intense centrozoon incorporating hard dance rhythms and lengthy, uninhibited touch guitar solos.
Chain D.L.K. dubbed it ""ambient soundscapes performed with the ease, passion and fragility of real time experimental noise tweakers, and intertwining lines of harmony and freeform fusion performed with the elegance, purity and casualty of a long forgotten jazz art that transpires from underneath the lid of vaporous electronics and artificial density.""
Allmusic described the album as ""finding some ground between ambient/techno float, space rock zone, and art rock chops, but by not trying to specifically aim at a particular style or approach... The title track is the standout, with Wöstheinrich's beat chaos going near full gabber levels at points throughout the twenty-minute composition, all while soothing keyboards and alternately screaming and calm guitar take the lead."" AMG also praised the band for  ""steer(ing) away from half-hearted fusion to their own particular logic"" as well as noting ""Reuter's ability to create a brief, thrilling hero rock riff as needed, giving the compositions a nice bit of bite.""
The Dutch Progressive Rock Pages described The Cult Of: Bibiboo as ""an album full of sonic landscapes which though minimalistic and seemingly simple, is exceptionally rich sounding"" while also commenting that ""commercial is a word that cannot be whispered when listening to this release and (unfortunately) it is a case of like it or leave it."" The review also compared the music to that of  Boards Of Canada and Stockhausen.
In 2005, while centrozoon worked in other areas, Synapscape released a remix EP of centrozoon material called Hands On centrozoon.

""Pop song"" trio work with Tim Bowness (2002–2007)
For their next stage of activity, centrozoon began working as a trio with the addition of No-Man singer Tim Bowness, making several appearances with this line-up in the UK in 2002 and shifting their musical focus towards tightly structured songs.
The first recorded evidence of the trio band was an EP called  The Scent Of Crash And Burn released on Burning Shed in 2003, fusing Bowness’ voice and alternately romantic/bleak lyrics with Reuter and Wöstheinrich's electropop soundtracks. Twilight Zone webzine compared the results to Depeche Mode, praising the “splendid arrangements” and “chilling prog atmospheres”, while Expose labelled it “a hybrid pop refinement that will appear to fans of Japan as well as King Crimson.”
For various reasons, the follow-up album (Never Trust The Way You Are) was delayed, with the band making up for lost time by releasing the live concert DVD Bigger Space on Burning Shed. Never Trust The Way You Are was finally released on Resonancer Records in 2005. The album featured guest performances from King Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto  on acoustic and electronic drums. Reviewing the album, Classic Rock commented ""The stark, spooky arrangements of 'Bigger Space' and 'Ten Versions Of America' fail to disguise cunning hooks, the record's myriad charms unravelling the more it's played."" Coming from a more traditional progressive rock perspective, the Dutch Progressive Rock Pages were less impressed, criticising the ""lack of variation in tempo"" and claiming that ""this is not a work that the more traditionally-minded prog fan is going to take to"" while labelling the album as ""solid"" and possibly ""appealing to those prog rock fans who enjoy relaxing to a bit of superior 'chill out' music from time to time.""
In January 2007, the Dutch audiophile label Tonefloat released the Never Trust The Things They Do album as a vinyl-only issue. This was a companion release to Never Trust The Way You Are featuring the trio/vocal version of centrozoon, and once again featured drumming and rhythms from Pat Mastelotto along with his Mastica bandmate Gum B (on upright bass) and engineer/audio guy Bill Munyon. This brought the collaboration with Tim Bowness to an amicable close, although none of the three musicians have dismissed the possibility of working together again.

Second ambient phase: Angel Liquor & Lovefield (2006–2007)
By 2006, centrozoon were mostly working in their original duo formation and released the Angel Liquor album on the Divine Frequency label. The Encyclopedia of Electronic Music called it ""angular and daring… a curious experimental album with a haunting and sometimes warm atmosphere.""
In 2007, centrozoon released the Lovefield album on the Inner Knot label. This was a return to a more minimalistic and textural approach, with the music divided into five ambient ""fields"". Reviews were mixed. Regen-Mag was measured in its praise, stating that the album ""impresses in its constructions if not its musicality"" and criticising ""the lack of a firm anchor for the casual listener to latch onto"" although approving the album for being ""impressive in its sound design and construction if not for the musical value... washes of mystical beauty slash and scurry through the mix, like brushstrokes on an audio canvas."" The reviewer concluded that ""where centrozoon excels is in the construction of these tracks; each track truly lives up to their monikers as literal fields of colorful sonic landscapes… If you are the type who enjoys being taken on a journey with no map, no destination, and no mode of transportation but your own imagination, then centrozoon's latest album might be the trip you've been waiting to take.""
The Enochian Apocalypse webzine was more generous, saying of the album that “it’s subtle, it holds and fills out the background to silence when relaxing at home, interesting, and above all involving.”)

Archive issues: Vacuum Love, Vols 1–5 (2007)
Later in 2007, centrozoon made six hours worth of archive material available as a download release called Vacuum Love, Vols 1–5 (released via MusicZeit). This material dated back to the first days of centrozoon back in October 1998, and featured original rough improvisations recorded live and direct to 2-track DAT.
The band commented ""The music is presented as is, uncensored. These sessions (some of which were recorded live in the studio, some live on stage) hint unmistakably at what was to come… There are some technical flaws with some of the recordings, but we've left them untouched in order to not mess with the flow of the improvisations. This music is the seed of centrozoon as we know it.""

The second trio and Boner (2008–present)
In 2008, centrozoon once again expanded to a trio: this time, the third member was multi-instrumentalist and sound designer Tobias Reber. Over the next four years the group played and recorded various concerts while collating material and approaches for the next record.
In 2012, centrozoon announced the forthcoming release of a new album, Boner, which they described as a return to highly experimental work involving dense overdubbing drawn from dozens of hours of recording. This album is to be released in a limited edition of 300 physical CDs, which in turn is to be divided into two separate but related releases: a version of Boner mixed and sequenced by Adrian Benavides and a version mixed and sequenced by Marziano Fontana (both version mastered by longstanding centrozoon collaborator Lee Fletcher). The band financed the recording of the album via a marketing campaign called ""Bonestarter"", in which they sold a variety of Boner-related packages (including physical and digital versions of the album, signatures, Skype-based interviews, T-shirts, cover art, music tutoring sessions, musical applications and even the album's multi-track source recordings). Boner was released on May 9, 2012.
Post-Boner, the band have concentrated on live work, which they've documented on 2014's The Room of Plenty and the ongoing 217 series drawn from their twentieth anniversary live tour.

Musical connections and other activities
Markus Reuter has a solo career in parallel to centrozoon and is a member of several other collaborative projects, including but not limited to:

Tuner, an American/German duo collaboration with King Crimson drummer Pat Mastellotto

Fennesz,"Christian Fennesz (born 25 December 1962) is a producer and guitarist active in electronic music since the 1990s, often credited simply by his last name. His work utilizes guitar and laptop computers to blend melody with treated samples and glitch production. He lives and works in Vienna, and currently records on the UK label Touch.
Fennesz first received widespread recognition for his 2001 album Endless Summer, released on the Austrian label Mego. He has collaborated with a number of artists, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jim O'Rourke, Ulver, David Sylvian, and King Midas Sound.

Biography
Fennesz was born and raised in Austria and studied music formally in art school. He started playing guitar around the age of 8 or 9. He initially performed as a member of the Austrian experimental rock band Maische before signing to electronic music label Mego as a solo artist. The influence of techno led him to begin composing with a laptop. In 1995 he released his first EP Instrument, which explored electro-acoustic and ambient stylings.
In 1997, Fennesz released his debut full-length album Hotel Paral.lel, which saw him delve more explicitly into laptop production and early glitch aesthetics. He followed with the 1998 single Plays, which contained near-unrecognizable covers of the Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"" and the Beach Boys' ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"". In the following years, he collaborated with a variety of artists, including Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg and Jim O'Rourke as part of Fenn O'Berg. In 2001, he released his third studio album Endless Summer to widespread critical praise and recognition. He collaborated with figures such as David Sylvian, Keith Rowe, eRikm, Ryuichi Sakamoto in the following years, and released the albums Venice (2004) and Black Sea (2007) to further critical praise.
In 2009 Fennesz teamed up with Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) to create In the Fishtank 15. The following year Fennesz released Szampler, a cassette containing his sample collection on the Tapeworm label. This release was later remixed by Stefan Goldmann and released as Goldmann vs. Fennesz: Remiksz. In 2011, he appeared on the live Ulver release The Norwegian National Opera, contributing guitar and effects to ""Not Saved."" In November 2013, Fennesz played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. In 2014, he released the studio album Bécs. In 2015, he collaborated with UK group King Midas Sound on the album Editions 1.

Recording techniques
Since the 1990s, Fennesz has worked with the programming software Max/MSP and the free patch Ppooll, which he runs in conjunction with the workstation Logic 9. In both studio and live settings, he routes his guitar through effects pedals (including a custom distortion box) and into his computer. There, it is processed and combined with Ppooll software plugins and tools such as samplers, synthesizers, effects, and MIDI controllers.

Chuck Wild,"Chuck Wild (born September 22, 1946, in Kansas City) is a keyboardist, composer, producer, recording artist and Emmy Award-nominated songwriter best known for his series of relaxation music albums using the artist name and imprint  Liquid Mind®. As of April 2021, there are 18 albums in the Liquid Mind catalog.

Early work
Wild's career spans 50 years from 1972 to the present, including writing 125 songs and compositions used in TV, films, and music albums. He was signed to Warner/Chappell Music and Lorimar-Telepictures as a staff songwriter in 1987 and co-wrote ""You're My One And Only"" with songwriter Marti Sharron, a #1 hit in Germany for Jennifer Rush on Passion.
His catalog includes studio work and concert performances as keyboardist with the 1980s Capitol Records band Missing Persons on the Spring Session M (1982) and Rhyme & Reason (1984) albums, during which time he worked with vocalist Dale Bozzio, drummer Terry Bozzio, guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, and bassist Patrick O'Hearn.
Studio work with Michael Jackson from 1994 to 1998 includes drums, keyboards, percussion, programming, sound design, sound effects, soundscapes, synthesizer and synthesizer programming on the HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I album. Wild was mentored by the late five-time Grammy Award-winning engineer/producer Bruce Swedien from 1984 to 2021.
Notable projects with other recording artists include studio work with Frank Zappa, Paula Abdul, and songwriting/studio recording for Philip Bailey, The Pointer Sisters and Tommy Page among many others.
He composed and recorded original music for The Panama Deception, a documentary film about the 1989 invasion of Panama by the United States and corporate media complicity. The film won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1992.
Wild co-wrote the song ""Starr X'd Lovers"" with Michèle Vice-Maslin and Dorian Cheah for the ABC TV series One Life to Live, which was nominated for Outstanding Original Song For A Drama Series at the 2011 Daytime Emmy Awards.
Wild was signed to the Real Music record label from 2004 to 2014. They remain the exclusive distributor for all Liquid Mind albums.
He received a Special President's Award from Barbara Wheeler, president of the American Music Therapy Association, on November 12, 2009, in San Diego California at their 2009 Annual Conference, ""In recognition for outstanding advocacy, generosity and support of the Music Therapy profession.""

Liquid Mind
Wild is best known for his series of Liquid Mind albums; Liquid Mind is classified by music critics and listeners as therapeutic music, sedative music, ambient music, or new-age music. For example, Liquid Mind XI: Deep Sleep charted at #1 on the iTunes USA Top 100 New Age album charts after its release on February 5, 2016. Relax: A Liquid Mind Experience charted at #10 on the New Age Billboard charts on March 22, 2008.

Inception
Wild discusses the inception and process of creating the Liquid Mind series in many published interviews:

The Liquid Mind series was born from my struggle with panic attacks and anxiety while co-scoring the Emmy Award-winning American Broadcasting Company television series Max Headroom with composer Michael Hoenig. During the same period more than 60 of my friends, associates, and family members died of HIV and cancer. To help heal from the panic, a counselor suggested that I write music representing the way I wanted to feel. This resulted in the first Liquid Mind album, Ambience Minimus, completed in 1988.
When I discovered this music was effective in healing my own anxiety and panic attacks, and with the encouragement of fellow artist Suzanne Doucet, I decided to release it through major distribution. The ultimate compliment to me is that people fall asleep to my music. Liquid Mind is functional music, assisting us to be tranquil at those times when that may not be easy.

Conflict resolution album
Wild's twelfth Liquid Mind studio album, Liquid Mind XII: Peace, was released on January 19, 2018. It is unique to the series in that it is the only Liquid Mind album composed by Wild with a specific theme. Titles of the eight tracks on the album represent steps in the process of conflict resolution.
Extensive liner notes and a music video were made available on the album website, including the following commentary by Wild (track titles are italicized):

""No one is born hating another person; people can and do change every day. Peace between differing ideologies and cultures, though not impossible to achieve, may be challenging to attain. However, peace on a person-to-person basis is possible between any two willing individuals, regardless of their backgrounds.
Even the smallest step taken by one individual as a peacemaker can build a bridge of hope, encouragement and understanding which will grow in a harmonious way. The titles of the compositions on this album are steps we can each take towards conflict resolution:

We begin by acknowledging that At the Center Is Love. Where there is a capacity for love, which all humans share, there can be peace. The peace process begins with respectful Communication between two people, Person to Person, which leads to a discovery of their Shared Values. These shared values create a willingness to Surrender to Love, and we are able to move forward together as a measure of Trust develops. As trust grows, we become aware of our Oneness, and the Spirit of Peace prevails. It is the process of engendering peace to which this album is dedicated.""

Cluster (band),"Cluster were a German musical duo consisting of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius, formed in 1971 and associated with West Germany's krautrock and kosmische music scenes. Born from the earlier Berlin-based group Kluster, they relocated in 1971 into the countryside village of Forst, Lower Saxony, where they built a studio and collaborated with musicians such as Conny Plank, Brian Eno, and Michael Rother; with the latter, they formed the influential side-project Harmonia. After first disbanding in 1981, Cluster reunited several times: from 1989 to 1997, and from 2007 to 2010.
AllMusic described the group as ""the most important and consistently underrated space rock unit of the '70s."" Music historian Julian Cope places three Cluster albums—Cluster II (1972), Zuckerzeit (1974), and Sowiesoso (1976)—in his Krautrock Top 50 and The Wire places the debut album in its ""One Hundred Records That Set the World on Fire"".

History
1971–1972: Early works
Dieter Moebius, Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Conrad Schnitzler formed Kluster in 1969 after the three had met at the Zodiak Free Arts Lab. This trio released three albums, Klopfzeichen, Zwei-Osterei and Eruption. When Schnitzler left the group, Roedelius and Moebius became Cluster. They were joined by Conny Plank on their debut self-titled release in 1971. They continued as a duo thereafter but worked extensively with producer/engineer Plank until his death in 1987.
Cluster's first release, an eponymous debut in 1971 on Philips, was the first major label release for the musicians. Previous Kluster works had been small or private label releases with no more than 300 copies pressed and sold. This album and the 1972 follow-up were a musical bridge between the avant-garde, discordant, proto-industrial sound of Kluster and the softer and more controlled ambient and rock sounds of their mid to late '70s albums. Cluster (later reissued as Cluster '71) has little or no discernible melody or beat. Allmusic review describes it, in part as ""...a dislocating, disorienting meld of random space music, industrial noise, proto-ambient atmospherics, feedback, and soundwash..."" The first album is also the only Cluster release on which Conny Plank is listed as a full third member of the band. He is credited as a composer and producer on Cluster II. Cluster signed with the influential Krautrock label Brain Records for their second release, a relationship which would continue through 1975.

1973–1979: Harmonia, Zuckerzeit, and Eno
In 1971 the duo moved to the rural village of Forst, West Germany to live in several Renaissance-era farmhouses and build their own studio. There Cluster and Neu! co-founder Michael Rother recorded two albums under the name Harmonia: Musik von Harmonia in 1974 and Deluxe in 1975, both released on Brain. This new trio also toured and a CD drawn from this period, Live 1974 was released in 2007.
After the release of the first Harmonia album and a period on tour, Rother returned to working with Klaus Dinger and an expanded Neu! lineup in order to complete his contractual obligations. In his absence Cluster went back to work as a duo, releasing Zuckerzeit later in 1974. Zuckerzeit sounds different from any other Cluster album, with clearly defined melody and beat and a rhythmic sound, at times approaching the Motorik style of Neu! Pitchfork Media places Zuckerzeit at number 63 in their ""Top 100 Albums of the 1970s"".
After the release of Deluxe Moebius, Roedelius, and Rother met in the studio again in 1976 and worked with Brian Eno. The resulting album, Tracks and Traces, was not released until 1997. Eno had been impressed with both Musik von Harmonia and Zuckerzeit before and had joined Harmonia once on tour in 1974, jamming with the group at The Fabrik in Hamburg.

In a 1997 interview, Hans-Joachim Roedelius spoke about the influence Rother had on Cluster's musical direction, on Zuckerzeit, and on subsequent releases:""Michael, as well as Eno, gave a lot and had a certain focus regarding our common work... Obviously working with Michael changed my and Moebius' focus, I don't know if Michael got the same benefit from working with us as we did working with him.""
The period from 1976–1979 was Cluster's most productive, with the four albums released during those four years receiving the most critical acclaim of any of Cluster's works. 1976 also marked Cluster's move to Hamburg based Sky Records. Their first release for Sky was Sowiesoso, a highly creative album of gentler melodies recorded in just two days.
In 1977 the duo joined with Brian Eno for recording sessions at Conny Plank's studio. The first release from those sessions was the even softer Cluster & Eno. Guest musicians on the album included Can bassist Holger Czukay and Asmus Tietchens on synthesizer. The association with Eno brought Cluster a much wider audience and international attention. The second album drawn from the Cluster & Eno sessions, After the Heat, released on Sky in 1978, featured a much wider variety of styles, including three tracks with vocals by Eno. Holger Czukay again played bass on one track, ""Tzima N'arki"" which featured the vocals of the Eno track ""King's Lead Hat"" recorded backwards. Roedelius also began releasing solo material during this period, beginning with Durch die Wüste for Sky in 1978.
Cluster's 1979 release Grosses Wasser was produced by ex-Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann and once again featured a wide variety of styles, including some of the most avant-garde material since the demise of Kluster, particularly during the middle section of the title track, which occupied all of side two.

1980–1989: Curiosum and related projects
On 12 June 1980 Cluster performed at the Wiener Festwochen Alternativ with Joshi Farnbauer. The performance was recorded and released as a limited edition cassette on the British York House Records (YHR) label and later in Germany on the Transmitter label of ""Grüne Kraft"" owner Werner Pieper. This one and only Cluster & Farnbauer release was titled Live in Vienna. The style of the music is highly experimental and discordant and very reminiscent of Moebius and Roedelius' early work with Conrad Schnitzler in Kluster. Live in Vienna was not released on CD until 2010, though two sections, each between 15 and 16 minutes long, were included as bonus tracks on the Hypnotic CD reissues of the first two Kluster albums, Klopfzeichen and Zwei-Osterei.
Also in 1980, Sky Records reissued the first Cluster release with new artwork and a new title: Cluster '71. That same year, Dieter Moebius teamed with former Cluster member, engineer and producer Conny Plank on the album Rastakraut Pasta, released on Sky. A second Moebius & Plank album, Material, was released in 1981.
Cluster's 1981 release Curiosum lives up to its name, with the seven tracks of offbeat and unusual melodies. Curiosum was Cluster's last release for Sky. It was also the final collaboration between Moebius and Roedelius before an eight-year-long hiatus.
During their hiatus from Cluster both Moebius and Roedelius continued to record and tour. They produced both solo albums and collaborations with other artists.
Moebius continued to work with Conny Plank. Moebius, Plank and Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier recorded the African-influenced, rhythmic album Zero Set, released by Sky in 1983. That same year, Moebius and Plank teamed with Mayo Thompson to record Ludwig's Law, which was not released until 1998. The final Moebius & Plank collaboration, En Route was recorded in 1986 but not released until 1995 on Curious Music. Plank died of cancer in 1987.
Roedelius released numerous solo albums and collaborations during this period, including continuing his Selbstportrait series of introspective ambient albums.
Sky Records, faced with no new material to release, turned to compilation albums to fill the gap. The 1984 release Stimmungen featured material from Sowiesoso and Grosses Wasser. In addition, two compilations credited to Eno, Moebius, Roedelius, and Plank, titled Begegnungen and Begegnungen II were released in 1984 and 1985 respectively. These collections included material from Sowiesoso, Cluster & Eno and After the Heat and also contained material from Moebius and Roedelius solo albums as well as the three Moebius & Plank albums released at that time. Cluster also had their first U.S. release in 1985: Relativity Records issued Old Land, credited to Cluster and Brian Eno and containing a mix of material from Cluster & Eno and After the Heat.

1989–1997: First reunion
In 1989 Cluster reunited, recording Apropos Cluster in 1989 and 1990. The album was released on the Curious Music label in 1991. Apropos Cluster is musically and structurally similar to Grosses Wasser, with four short tracks followed by the nearly 22 minute long, more experimental title piece. Apropos Cluster was Cluster's first album to be released initially in the U.S., and it was followed by American reissues of their Sky and Brain catalogs during the early and mid '90s.
Cluster's next album was the 1995 release One Hour. This album featured a single, long musical piece, the longest ever recorded by Cluster, divided into 11 tracks on the CD. One Hour is structured much like the title track of Grosses Wasser, with short, soft melodic sections at the beginning and the end sandwiching a longer experimental central section. One Hour was the last studio album released by Cluster until 2009, 14 years later.
Cluster used the liner notes for One Hour to pay tribute to the late Konrad (Conny) Plank:

""However the most creative input and personal support over the years came from Konrad Plank, who was, in effect, a 'silent member in the background'.""

In 1996 Cluster had acclaimed concert tours in Japan as well as their first tour of the United States. The concert tours produced musical documents: the albums Japan 1996 Live, released on the Japanese Captain Trip label in 1997 and First Encounter Tour 1996, recorded in the United States and released on the American Purple Pyramid label, also in 1997. Tim Story, best known as a keyboardist and ambient music composer, co-produced Japan 1996 Live and produced First Encounter Tour 1996, an association which would lead to later musical collaboration between Roedelius and Story. After the United States tour Roedelius and Moebius parted.

1997–2007: Hiatus and second reunion
During the decade that followed Moebius and Roedelius worked on various solo projects and collaborations.
Roedelius continued to record and tour with Aquarello, who released a self-titled live album in 1998. In 2000 Roedelius reunited with Kluster bandmate Conrad Schnitzler for the first time in nearly three decades. The resulting album, Acon 2000/1 was released on Captain Trip in 2001. Roedelius recorded two albums with Tim Story: The Persistence of Memory in 2000 and Lunz in 2002. A collaboration with Mott the Hoople alumnus Morgan Fisher, Neverless, was released in 2005. A total of 14 solo albums and three additional collaborations were recorded by Roedelius during this period.
Moebius recorded two solo albums during his second hiatus from Cluster: Blotch in 1999 and Nurton in 2006. Moebius also performed and toured with former Harmonia bandmate Michael Rother during this period. He also worked on an album by the new Krautrock supergroup Amon Guru which was released in 2007.
Moebius and Roedelius reunited for a performance at the Kosmische Club in Camden, London on 15 April 2007. They also performed at the opening of documenta 12 on 15 June 2007 in Kassel, Germany and the fourth annual More Ohr Less festival in Lunz, Austria on 10 August 2007. From September to November 2007 Cluster had additional concert performances in Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Estonia, and the Netherlands. Roedelius also gave a solo concert performance in Ojai, California in the United States. Moebius and Roedelius have also reunited with Michael Rother and the first Harmonia concert in more than 30 years took place in Berlin on 27 November 2007. They performed at the opening of documenta 12, a major exhibition of modern and contemporary art held every five years in Kassel, Germany on 15 June 2007.
Cluster performed in the United States for the first time since 1996 at the Detroit Institute of Arts on 16 May 2008 and for the No Fun Fest at the Knitting Factory in New York City on 17 May 2008. They also performed four dates in California from 22 to 25 May.
The first Cluster album since 1997 drawn from their live performance in Berlin on 14 September 2007 was released on Important Records in Spring, 2008.
They performed a one-off live collaboration with Chrome Hoof in London on 21 March 2009. In May 2009 they released Qua, their first studio album in over a decade.
On 22 November 2009, Cluster supported Tortoise at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
On 17 November 2010, Roedelius announced, via email and across social media, that Cluster would split up at end of 2010. Their final concert took place in Minehead, Somerset, England, on 5 December 2010. Roedelius announced that he would perform as ""Qluster"" with musician Onnen Bock and a trilogy of releases was planned, the first of which was released in May 2011.

Musical style
Cluster's musical style varied greatly over their career. AllMusic described them as ""the most important and consistently underrated space rock unit of the '70s,"" noting that they first began as ""an improv group that used everything from synthesizers to alarm clocks and kitchen utensils in their performances"" and later transitioned to produce ""many landmark LPs in the field of German space music often termed kosmische."" On 1974's Zuckerzeit, the group shifted to a more accessible sound that ""combined trippy drum machine rhythms with woozy, pastoral melodies, resulting in a skewed, playful vision of futuristic pop."" Cluster later explored ambient music into the 1990s.
Cluster has been widely influential not only to ambient and electronic music artists, but to techno, electronica and popular music as well. Artists and groups whose music has been influenced by Cluster include David Bowie, Robert Rich, John Foxx (formerly of Ultravox), Alex Paterson of The Orb, Coil, Oval, To Rococo Rot, and Mouse on Mars.

Cocteau Twins,"Cocteau Twins were a Scottish rock band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative subgenre of dream pop and helped define what would become shoegaze.
They signed with the record label 4AD in 1982 and released their debut album Garlands. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, ""Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops"", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988 Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. ""Carolyn's Fingers"", the only single from Blue Bell Knoll, was a commercial success for the band on the US Alternative Airplay Charts. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums. Heaven or Las Vegas was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and was voted number 218 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2020, Rolling Stone listed it at No. 245 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005 the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella Festival and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser ""couldn’t bring herself to work with Guthrie"". In a 2021 interview, Raymonde claimed that Cocteau Twins ""will never reform"".

History
1979–1983: Early years
Guthrie and Heggie, both from Grangemouth, Scotland, formed the band in 1979. They met the 17-year-old Fraser in 1981 at a local disco, The Hotel International, where Guthrie was DJing, and she became the group's vocalist.
Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi recalls that the Cocteau Twins were the support act for his band The Dream Boys at a gig at a hotel in Grangemouth, for which he did a runner and failed to pay them because the door takings did not cover the cost of his van hire.
Prior to releasing their debut album, the band recorded a four track session for John Peel in June 1982, including ""Wax and Wane"" and ""Garlands"". Their debut LP Garlands, released through 4AD in July 1982, was an instant success, peaking at number 2 in the indie albums chart in the UK. Sounds wrote that the style of the band was ""mixing strong Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division influences"". NME's Don Watson compared it to gothic rock bands such as Gene Loves Jezebel and Xmal Deutschland, while Spin magazine's Sue Cummings compared it retrospectively to Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bauhaus. It was followed by the EP Lullabies in October. In April 1983 the band released a second EP, Peppermint Pig.
Cocteau Twins' sound on their first three recordings relied on the combination of Heggie's rhythmic basslines, Guthrie's minimalist guitar melodies, and Fraser's voice. The band's next full-length LP record, Head over Heels, relied solely on the latter two, following Heggie's amicable departure after the tour that followed the release of Peppermint Pig (he would later join Lowlife). This led to the characteristic Cocteau Twins sound: Fraser's voice, by turns ethereal and operatic, combined with increasingly effects-heavy guitar playing by Guthrie (who has often said that he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played, though he later admitted that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations). 
In 1983 the band participated in 4AD's This Mortal Coil project, which spawned a cover version of Tim Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"" (performed by Guthrie and Fraser). Despite appearing under the This Mortal Coil name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks. During the TMC sessions, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of Drowning Craze), who joined Cocteau Twins later that year.

1984–1989: Rise to fame
With Raymonde, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums and EPs that explored their new style. These included The Spangle Maker (1984), Treasure (1984), Aikea-Guinea (1985), Tiny Dynamine (1985), Echoes in a Shallow Bay (1985), and Love's Easy Tears (1986). Raymonde, who was called in to work on the second album by This Mortal Coil, did not participate in the recording of the fourth Cocteau Twins LP, Victorialand (1986), a predominantly acoustic record which featured only Guthrie and Fraser. Raymonde returned to the group for The Moon and the Melodies (1986), a collaboration with ambient composer Harold Budd, which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name.
In 1985 4AD signed an agreement with Relativity Records for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the US and other territories. To commemorate the event, the compilation The Pink Opaque (1985) was released as a way of introducing the new, broader audience to the band's back catalogue.
While remaining a 4AD band internationally, Cocteau Twins finally signed a major-label contract with Capitol Records in 1988 for distribution in the United States, and released their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, in September of that year. ""Carolyn's Fingers"" was heavily played on the U.S. radio stations, peaking at No. 2 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.

1990–1994: Mainstream success
The group released Heaven or Las Vegas in early 1990. The most commercially successful of their many recordings, the album reached number seven in the UK Albums Chart immediately after its release. Despite the success of the record and the subsequent concert tours, not everything was well with the band. They parted ways with 4AD following Heaven or Las Vegas partly because of conflicts with the label's founder Ivo Watts-Russell, and were close to breaking up over internal problems due in large part to Guthrie's substance abuse.
While on their international tour supporting Heaven or Las Vegas, the group signed a new recording contract with Mercury Records subsidiary Fontana for the UK and elsewhere, while retaining their US relationship with Capitol. They added several live musicians to their touring band during this era, to better replicate the layered sound of their studio albums. In 1991 4AD and Capitol released a box set that compiled the band's EPs from 1982 to 1990, and also included a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material.
Fraser and Guthrie had a daughter, Lucy Belle, born in 1989. The couple ended their 13-year relationship in 1993. The band's seventh LP, Four-Calendar Café, their first since Fraser and Guthrie's separation, was released in late 1993. The band explained that Four-Calendar Café was a response to the turmoil that had engulfed them in the intervening years, with Guthrie entering rehab and quitting alcohol and drugs, and Fraser undergoing psychotherapy.

1995–1997: Milk & Kisses and break-up
1995 saw the release of two new EPs: Twinlights and Otherness. Some of the tracks on Twinlights and Otherness were versions of songs from the band's eighth album, Milk & Kisses (1996). The record saw the return of more heavily layered guitars, and Fraser began once again to obscure her lyrics, though not entirely. Two singles were taken from the album: ""Tishbite"" and ""Violaine""; both exist in two CD versions, with different B-sides included on each. The band, augmented by an extra guitarist and a drummer, toured extensively to support the album, their last for Mercury/Fontana. A new song, ""Touch Upon Touch"", which debuted during the live shows and was recorded later in 1996 was also one of the two songs written and arranged by Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde for Chinese pop singer Faye Wong for her Mandarin album Fuzao released in June 1996, the other being ""Tranquil Eye"" from Violaine released in October 1996.
In 1997 while recording what was to have been their ninth LP, the trio disbanded over irreconcilable differences in part related to the breakup of Guthrie and Fraser. While a number of songs were partially recorded and possibly completed, the band has stated that they will likely never be finished or released in any form.

1998–present: Post-breakup
In 1999 Bella Union, the record label founded by Guthrie and Raymonde, released a double-CD Cocteau Twins compilation entitled BBC Sessions. The collection is a complete record of the band's appearances on UK radio programs from 1982 to 1996, with rare and unreleased material included. In 2000 4AD released Stars and Topsoil, a compilation of selected songs picked by the band members that had been released during their years with 4AD; all recordings had been digitally remastered by Guthrie. In 2003 4AD followed Stars and Topsoil with the release of digitally remastered versions of the first six Cocteau Twins LPs.
In January 2005 Cocteau Twins announced that they would be reforming to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 30 April 2005, and later indicated that additional tour dates would be added. However, on 16 March, the reunion was cancelled after Fraser announced that she would not take part. In a 2009 interview Fraser said she could not go through the pain of sharing the stage with her former lover Guthrie, the issue behind the band's 1997 breakup. Raymonde revealed that the band had also booked a 55-date world tour, which would have paid him £1.5 million. Later in 2005 4AD released a worldwide limited edition of 10,000 compilation box set titled Lullabies to Violaine, a 4-disc set that details every single and EP released from 1982 to 1996. This was shortly followed up by two 2-disc sets of the same names, known as Volume 1 and Volume 2.
Since March 2007 the band has started podcasts of exclusive material. On 6 October 2008 Cocteau Twins were awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award, which they accepted in a rare collective live appearance.
In 2022 Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde were awarded with the Visionary Award by The Ivors Academy. Fraser and Guthrie attended the award ceremony in London in May 2022 in a rare public appearance since the band's disbandment in 1997.

The former members of Cocteau Twins have remained active musically in the years since the band's demise. In addition to forming Bella Union, Guthrie and Raymonde have produced releases from new bands signed to that label.
Raymonde released the solo album Blame Someone Else as the first release on Bella Union. He also co-produced the posthumous album by Billy Mackenzie from the Associates, then went on to produce several Domino Records artists like James Yorkston, Archie Bronson Outfit (whom he later managed) and Clearlake. More recently he has produced the UK band the Duke Spirit, London-based duo Helene, former Golden Virgins frontman Lucas Renney and has mixed the Mercury Prize nominated album The End of History by Fionn Regan. In his role running Bella Union, he has discovered such artists as Laura Veirs, Fleet Foxes, Midlake, Lift to Experience, the Low Anthem, I Break Horses, the Czars and John Grant. The label is renowned for its long-term relationships with its artists, such as Beach House who released the first four of their albums with Bella Union, as have Dirty Three, Midlake etc. Raymonde picked up the Independent Record Company of the Year award at the Music Week Awards (as voted by UK independent retailers) in 2010, 2012 and 2014.
Guthrie has released six solo albums – Imperial, Continental, Carousel, Emeralds, Fortune, and Pearldiving– and eight EPs. He toured extensively with his band Violet Indiana, which included ex-Cocteau Twins guitarist Mitsuo Tate in the line-up. He has also scored the music for three movies — Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin (in collaboration with Harold Budd), Dany Saadia's 3:19 Nada Es Casualidad (a Mexican/Spanish production), and again with Gregg Araki and Harold Budd on the score and the soundtrack of White Bird in a Blizzard. He reunited with Budd to collaborate on two companion albums, Before the Day Breaks and After the Night Falls, and the albums Bordeaux, Winter Garden (a collaboration that included Italian electronica artist Eraldo Bernocchi), and Another Flower, which was released after Budd's passing in 2020. In 2006 Guthrie produced three songs on Mahogany's Connectivity. He also produced and played guitar on Apollo Heights debut album, White Music for Black People.
Fraser provided guest vocals on the Future Sound of London's single ""Lifeforms"" (1993), vocals for three songs on Massive Attack's Mezzanine in 1998 (as well as touring with them several times), and for other musical projects and groups. She wrote the lyrics and sang the vocals for ""Teardrop"" by Massive Attack which was released as a single in 1998 and reached number 10 in the UK singles chart. Fraser provided the vocals for ""Lament for Gandalf"" on The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack. In 2000 she sang with Peter Gabriel on Ovo (The Millennium Show). In 2005 she worked with Breton musician Yann Tiersen on two songs for his album Les retrouvailles. In 2009 she released the single ""Moses"" on Rough Trade.

Musical style and influences
Cocteau Twins' early recordings were classified in the gothic rock and post-punk genres. The band's influences at the time they formed included The Birthday Party (drummer Phill Calvert encouraged the group to sign to 4AD), Sex Pistols, Kate Bush and Siouxsie and the Banshees (Fraser had Siouxsie tattoos on her arms for several years). The band was named after the early Simple Minds song ""The Cocteau Twins"" (later rewritten as ""No Cure""). As the band's sound developed, their subsequent music was classified as dream pop, darkwave and ethereal wave.
Cocteau Twins' music influenced numerous artists in different genres, including Slowdive, Deftones, the Weeknd, Napalm Death, John Grant, Prince, Sigur Rós and Massive Attack.

Coil (band),"Coil were an English experimental music group formed in 1982 in London and dissolved in 2005. Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner and Psychic TV bandmate Peter Christopherson (formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle). Coil's work explored themes related to the occult, sexuality, alchemy, and drugs while influencing genres such as gothic rock, neofolk and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group ""one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial scene.""
After the release of their 1984 debut EP How to Destroy Angels, Coil joined Some Bizzare Records, through which they released two full-length albums, Scatology (1985) and Horse Rotorvator (1986). In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, among them the rejected score for the first Hellraiser film. After departing from Some Bizzare, Coil established their own record label, Threshold House, through which they produced and released Love's Secret Domain (1991). Financial difficulties slowed the group's work in the early 1990s before they returned to the project on releases such as Astral Disaster (1999), and the Musick to Play in the Dark series  composed of Vol. 1 (1999) and Vol. 2 (2000), as well as releasing several projects under aliases such as Black Light District, ELpH, and Time Machines.
Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band's career included Stephen Thrower, Danny Hyde, Drew McDowall, William Breeze, Thighpaulsandra and Ossian Brown. With involvement from these members, the group also started several smaller independent vanity labels, including Eskaton and Chalice. The group's first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004. Following the accidental death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Christopherson formally announced that Coil as a creative entity had ceased to exist, ending the Coil discography with The Ape of Naples (2005). Posthumous releases and compilations of unreleased material have since followed this.

History
1982–1983: Formation and early years
In 1978, John Balance (born Geoff[rey] Burton; also known as Rushton, his stepfather's surname) was a teenage zine journalist, writing—along with his schoolmate Tom Craig, a grandson of Edward Carrick and great-grandson of Edward Gordon Craig—under a moniker Stabmental, through which he published articles on UK underground artists, including seminal industrial bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire. A Throbbing Gristle fan, Balance had contacted them via mail, and thus befriended the Throbbing Gristle frontperson Genesis P-Orridge. In February 1980, Balance had attended a Throbbing Gristle gig recorded and released as Heathen Earth, where he had first met P-Orridge's bandmate Peter Christopherson and befriended him as well.
Following the dissolution of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, P-Orridge, Christopherson, and Alex Fergusson (formerly of Alternative TV) went on to form the new project, titled Psychic TV, along with the accompanying fellowship titled Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Balance, who had attended the University of Sussex for a short time and participated in Brian Williams' Lustmord project, returned in London to live with Christopherson—with whom a romantic partnership had begun. As a Psychic TV member, Balance participated in the recording of the single ""Just Drifting"" (from the album Force the Hand of Chance) and, the following year, of the album Dreams Less Sweet.
Already having an experience of performing and recording previous to his tenure in Psychic TV, Balance went on to use the name Coil in 1982, originally envisioned for a solo project. In 1983, Balance wrote a manifesto titled The Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare and sent a tape of the song ""On Balance"", dated 5 May 1982, to Gary Levermore's label Third Mind Records for an inclusion on a compilation album Rising From The Red Sand; Levermore, however, had rejected the track. Despite this, Balance had recorded three more new tracks—""S for Sleep"", ""Red Weather"", and ""Here to Here (Double-Headed Secret)""—on 11 May 1983. On 4 August 1983, Coil—as the duo of Balance and Christopherson—had played its first gig in London at the Magenta Club, during a screening of films by Cerith Wyn Evans and Derek Jarman. Since Christopherson's commitments for Psychic TV—in which he had become disillusioned due to growing conflict with P-Orridge—still limited his participation in Coil, Balance approached John Gosling—also Psychic TV member who fronted his own project Zos Kia—to work with. Balance's and Gosling's collaboration resulted in the next three gigs during 1983, with the last one being performed in December on Berlin Atonal festival, where Balance participated as both Psychic TV and Coil member. The recordings from aforementioned gigs, as well as ""On Balance"", were later included on Zos Kia/Coil split album Transparent, released in February 1984 by Austrian label Nekrophile Records. Since January 1984, Balance and Christopherson had departed from Psychic TV and the Temple of Psychic Youth, in order to make Coil as a full-time concern.

1984–1986: How to Destroy Angels and Some Bizzare years
The band's official recording debut, an extended play titled How to Destroy Angels, was released on the Good Friday (20 April) of 1984 by a Belgian-based label L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords.: 49  Recorded on 19 February 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, the album was dedicated to Mars as the god of spring and war, using predominantly iron and steel instruments.
Shortly after in May 1984, Coil went on to record their first full-length studio album, eventually titled Scatology, approaching JG Thirlwell as a co-producer and co-composer; several others contributors, including Stephen Thrower, Alex Fergusson and Gavin Friday, took part in its recording. Scatology's themes echoed those of How to Destroy Angels, while focusing mainly on alchemy as an idea of transforming matter.
Scatology was released in early 1985 with a 1984 copyright date by the band's own label, Force & Form, and K.422 (a Some Bizzare Records sublabel), to mainly positive feedback. Shortly after, a single featuring a remix of ""Panic"" and a cover of ""Tainted Love"" was released, with the profits being donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust; hailed since then as the first AIDS benefit music release, it was supported with the ""Tainted Love"" video directed by Christopherson, which was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art in New York, U.S.
Horse Rotorvator followed in 1986 as the next full-length release. Although songs such as ""The Anal Staircase"" and ""Circles of Mania"" sound like evolved versions of Scatology material, the album is characterized by slower tempos, and represented a new direction for the group. The album has a darker theme than previous releases, according to Balance:

Horse Rotorvator was this vision I'd had of this mechanical/flesh thing that ploughed up the earth and I really did have a vision of it—a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night ... The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse killed their horses and use their jawbones to make this huge earth-moving machine.""
The artwork features a photograph of the location of a notorious IRA bombing, in which a bomb was detonated on a military orchestra pavilion. Horse Rotorvator was in part influenced by the AIDS-related deaths of some of their friends. Furthermore, the song ""Ostia (The Death of Pasolini)"" is about the mysterious death of Pier Paolo Pasolini, as well as what Balance described as ""the number one suicide spot in the world"", the white cliffs of Dover.

Gold Is the Metal... and Unnatural History (1986–1990)
After the release of Horse Rotorvator, Coil left Some Bizzare Records, since they fell out with its owner Stevo Pearce. Gold Is the Metal (With the Broadest Shoulders) followed as a full-length release in 1987, marking the beginning of the band's own label, Threshold House—the album is described in the liner notes as ""not the follow-up to Horse Rotorvator, but a completely separate package – a stopgap and a breathing space – the space between two twins"", which refers to Horse Rotorvator and Love's Secret Domain.
The 13-track Unnatural History compilation was then released on Threshold House in 1990. The first three songs on the album were first released as one half of the Nightmare Culture mini-album.

Love's Secret Domain (1991–1992)
Love's Secret Domain (abbreviated LSD) followed in 1991 as the next ""proper"" Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since Horse Rotorvator. LSD represents a progression in Coil's style and became a template for what would be representative of newer waves of post-industrial music, blended with their own style of acid house. Although the album was more upbeat, it was not intended as a dance record, as Christopherson explained ""I wouldn't say it's a party atmosphere, but it's more positive."" ""Windowpane"" and a Jack Dangers remix of ""The Snow"" were released as singles, both of which had music videos directed by Christopherson. The video for ""Windowpane"" was shot in the Golden Triangle, where, Balance claimed, ""the original Thai and Burmese drug barons used to exchange opium for gold bars with the CIA."" Christopherson recalled ""John [Balance] discovered while he was performing that where he was standing was quicksand! In the video you can actually see him getting deeper and deeper."" Furthermore, Thai friends of the group commented that they had known of several people that died where Coil had shot footage for the music video.
A music video for the song ""Love's Secret Domain"" was also shot, which was initially unreleased due to its nature: as Christopherson explained, ""We shot 'Love's Secret Domain' in a go-go boy bar in Bangkok; with John [Balance] performing on stage with about 20 or 30 dancing boys, which probably won't get played on MTV, in fact!"" As of January 2015, the music video is viewable on more than one YouTube channel. Stolen & Contaminated Songs followed as a full-length release in 1992. However, as with Gold Is the Metal..., it is a collection of outtakes and demos from the LSD era.

Soundtracks and side projects (1993–1998)
Coil separated their works into many side projects, publishing music under different names and a variety of styles. The pre-Coil aliases, Zos Kia and Sickness of Snakes, formed the foundation of a style that would evolve to characterize their initial wave of releases.
Before embarking on their second wave of side projects and pseudonyms, Coil created a soundtrack for the movie Hellraiser, although they withdrew from the project when they suspected their music would not be used. Furthermore, Coil claimed inspiration for Pinhead was partly drawn from the piercing magazines that director Barker borrowed from the group. Balance explained after the release of Stolen and Contaminated Songs, in around 1992:

Yeah it would have been brilliant but we wouldn't have carried on, because they were changing everything and they weren't being very nice to us, the actual film people. They were keeping us in the dark a lot. We said we'd had enough just at the same time they decided they wanted to use Howard Shore. They just wanted normal film music. They didn't want anything too scary which is sad and ridiculous for a horror film.
Also in 1992, Threshold House released a ""Remixes And Re-Recordings"" version of How to Destroy Angels. Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton contributed a remix of the song, ""How To Destroy Angels II"".
In 1993, Coil contributed music to Derek Jarman's film Blue. Their 1985 score for Jarman's The Angelic Conversation was released on CD in 1994. In addition, they recorded soundtracks for the documentary Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex as well as Sarah Dales Sensuous Massage.
Much like the pre-Coil aliases, Coil's series of side projects represented a diverse basis from which the group evolved a different style of sound. While Nasa Arab—credited to the group's project ""The Eskaton""—was Coil's farewell to the acid house genre, the following projects, ELpH, Black Light District, and Time Machines, were all based heavily on experimentation with drone, an ingredient that would define Coil's following work. These releases also launched the start of Coil's new label Eskaton.
Transparent was reissued in CD format in 1997 on Threshold House. A disc and booklet were packaged in a ""thick"" slipcase, which was released
in partnership with the World Serpent music company.

Late Coil (1998–2004)
After the wave of experimental side projects, Coil's sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations Unnatural History II, Windowpane & The Snow and Unnatural History III. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed to coincide with the equinox and solstices of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation. The first single, Spring Equinox: Moon's Milk or Under an Unquiet Skull, featured two versions of the same song, the second version of which included an electric viola contribution from a newly inducted member, William Breeze. The second single, Summer Solstice: Bee Stings, also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the industrial-noise song ""A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)"", which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson's who had committed suicide earlier that year. The third single, Autumn Equinox: Amethyst Deceivers, includes the track ""Rosa Decidua"", which features vocals by Rose McDowall. The single also features the song ""Amethyst Deceivers"", later reworked and performed throughout most of Coil's tour—it was eventually re-made into an alternate version on the LP The Ape of Naples. The fourth single, Winter Solstice: North, also includes a track sung by McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project Rosa Mundi. The series would later be re-released as the double-CD set, Moon's Milk (In Four Phases).
Astral Disaster was created with the assistance from new band member Thighpaulsandra, and was released in January 1999 via Sun Dial member Gary Ramon's label, Prescription. Although the album was initially limited to just 99 copies, it would later be re-released in a substantially different form. Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1 followed in September 1999, and a few months later Coil performed their first concert in 16 years.
Queens Of The Circulating Library followed in April 2000, with production credit given to Thighpaulsandra. The single-track, full-length drone album is the only Coil release made without the assistance of Christopherson. Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2 followed in September 2000, and Coil began to perform live more intensively, a period that also included writing the music for Black Antlers in between a series of mini-tours. Coil also released a series of live albums around this time. Constant Shallowness Leads To Evil, a noise-driven experimental album reminiscent of Christopherson's work with Throbbing Gristle, was first sold at a live performance in September 2000. Coil finally released Black Antlers in June 2004.
In contrast to many of their earlier releases, Coil's later material is characterized by a slower sound which relies more on drone than acid house. This change in sound was reflected in their live performances, as songs like ""Ostia"" and ""Slur"" were slowed down from their original pace, as well as re-recordings of ""Teenage Lightning"" and ""Amethyst Deceivers"" that were later released on The Ape Of Naples.

Coil Live
Coil's live incarnation is associated with a distinct legacy. The first live shows took place in 1983, but after only four performances, 15 years would pass before they would play live again.
On 14 December 1999, Coil performed elph.zwölf at Volksbuehne in Berlin. Although the performance lasted just under 18 minutes, it marked the beginning of a new era of live performances. Coil would go on to perform close to 50 additional concerts, with varied set lists as well as performers.
Coil performed twice at the Royal Festival Hall in 2000. The first concert was in April, as part of a weekend curated by Julian Cope, when they first performed as the full band line-up – and wearing the ""fluffy suits"" that would become a staple of live performances for the first time – performing Time Machines. They performed again in September, sharing a bill with Jim Thirlwell (as Foetus) on that occasion. Both performances were full sets.
Coil's performances were surrealistic visually and audibly. The signature fluffy suits, an idea inspired by Sun Ra, played a foremost role at the live shows. The suits would later be used as album covers for the release Live One, while other costumes appear on the covers of Live Two and Live Three—straitjacket and mirror-chested hooded jumpsuit, respectively. Video screens projected footage and animations created by Christopherson, while fog machines created an eerie atmosphere. Balance would often screech and howl during performances, which would add to the effect.
The band's performance at the 2003 All Tomorrow's Parties festival was released as ...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms. Released on Threshold House in 2005 as a digipak, a Thai version was released the following year. ...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms was released under a name chosen by Balance before his death in November 2004.
Many Coil performances were released, including the widely available releases of Live Four, Live Three, Live Two, Live One and ...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms, as well as several very limited editions, such as Selvaggina, Go Back Into The Woods and Megalithomania!. Video recordings of several concerts were released on the DVD box set, Colour Sound Oblivion, in 2010.
Coil's final performance was at DEAF (Dublin Electronic Arts Festival), Dublin City Hall in Ireland.

Deaths of Balance and Christopherson
Balance died on 13 November 2004, after he fell from a second-floor landing in his home. Christopherson announced Balance's death on the Threshold House website, and provided details of the circumstances of the death. Balance's memorial service was held near Bristol on 23 November 2004, and was attended by approximately 100 people.
The final studio album, The Ape of Naples, was released on 2 December 2005. In August 2006, the rare CD-R releases The Remote Viewer and Black Antlers were ""sympathetically remastered"" and expanded into two-disc versions, which included new and recently remixed material. A comprehensive 16-DVD boxset, titled Colour Sound Oblivion, was released in July 2010. A ""Patron Edition"" was pre-orderable in November 2009 and sold out in three hours. Christopherson also discussed the possibility of releasing Coil's entire back catalogue on a single Blu-ray disc.
In November 2006, the official Coil website posted the following announcement: ""Following the success of Thai pressings of The Remote Viewer and Black Antlers, and after many requests, we are planning to expand the CD catalog still further."" A few days later Duplais Balance and Moon's Milk in Six Phases were announced. Furthermore, an expanded vinyl version of The Ape of Naples, which includes the album The New Backwards, has been released, and a two-disc version of Time Machines has been announced.
Six years after the death of Balance, Christopherson died in his sleep on 24 November 2010 in Bangkok, Thailand.

Artistry
Style, instruments and creative methods
While their work became increasingly difficult to describe as their career progressed, Coil's musical style encompassed genres such as industrial music, noise music, ambient music and dark ambient, neofolk, spoken word, drone music and minimalism. They often considered their works more as magical rituals than as musical pieces; Balance explicitly referred to this approach as ""magickal music"". Balance described the first half of the Coil discography as ""solar"" and their later work as ""moon musick"".
Coil incorporated many exotic and rare instruments into their recordings and performances. The group expressed particular interest in vintage electronic instruments including the Moog synthesizer, the ANS synthesizer, the Mellotron and the Optigan. During Coil's later period, marimba player Tom Edwards joined the group, and performed on the live albums Live Two and Live Three, as well as on the studio albums Black Antlers and The Ape of Naples.
Often ensuing from improvisation and intuition, Coil utilized experimental techniques such as the cut-up technique, ritual drug use, sleep deprivation, lucid dreaming, tidal shifts, John Dee-like methods of scrying, technical glitches, SETI synchronization and chaos theory.

Releases
Coil's distribution sometimes included releasing limited editions of albums, thereby making them collectors' items among fans. Including quirks such as ""art objects"", sigil-like autographs and even stains of blood in the packaging of their albums, Coil claimed that this made their work more personal for true fans, turning their records into something akin to occult artifacts. This practice was markedly increased in the later half of Coil's career. Due to this, critics accused Coil and its record company of price gouging. However, Balance expressed interest in having regular Coil albums in every shop that wanted them. In 2003, Coil began re-releasing many rare works, mostly remixed. They also launched a download service, where a large amount of their out-of-print music was made available.

Religious views
Coil held pagan and alchemical beliefs, as well as a fixation on chaos magic, but were sometimes labelled as Satanic. Balance explicitly referred to himself as a ""Born Again Pagan"", and described his paganism as a ""spirituality within nature."" Christopherson, however, described the beliefs of Coil as unassociated:

We don't follow any particular religious dogma. In fact, quite the reverse, we tend to discourage the following of dogmas, or false prophets, as it were. And we don't have a very sympathetic view of Christians up to this point. The thing we follow is our own noses; I don't mean in a chemical sense.

Members
John Balance was the founder of Coil and was the primary vocalist and composer of Coil's music.
Peter Christopherson was the chief producer.
Stephen Thrower worked as a full-time member of Coil from 1987 to 1992.
Danny Hyde was periodically involved as co-author, collaborator, studio engineer, remixer, and producer. Peter Christopherson called him as Coil's 3rd secret member.
Drew McDowall began collaborating with Coil in 1990 and was officially inducted in 1995. He left the group sometime between 1999 and 2000.
Rose McDowall, Drew's ex-wife, provided vocals for several Coil tracks including ""Wrong Eye"", ""Rosa Decidua"" and ""Christmas Is Now Drawing Near"". She also collaborated with Coil for the short-lived project Rosa Mundi.
Ossian Brown had been a Coil collaborator since about 1992 and joined the group in 2000, touring extensively with them and working on several recordings up until the final Coil album The Ape of Naples.
William Breeze was Coil's electric viola player between 1997 and 2000.
Thighpaulsandra became an official member on 26 January 1999 and participated until the final album, The Ape of Naples. Most notably, he created the entire instrumental for the album Queens of the Circulating Library.
John Gosling performed with the initial live incarnation of Coil, as featured on Transparent.
Tom Edwards of Spiritualized participated in Coil's live incarnation, and was Coil's marimba player from 2000 on.
Cliff Stapleton played hurdy-gurdy on several live performances, as well as in the studio for Coil at various points throughout the 2000s.
Massimo & Pierce of Black Sun Productions were members of Coil Live in 2002. However, they were stage performers, never contributing musically other than reading the poetic introduction to ""Ostia"" during live performances.
Mike York was part of the Coil Live collective for a limited time.

Influences and legacy
Although Coil expressed interest in many musical groups, they rarely, if ever, claimed to be influenced by them. Coil explicitly stated the influence of such non-musical sources as William Burroughs, Aleister Crowley, Brion Gysin and Austin Spare. Furthermore, the group were friends with Burroughs and owned some of Spare's original artwork.
Balance encouraged fans to trade, discuss and discover new and different forms of music, stressing the importance of variety. Music that Coil expressed interest in is diverse and wide-ranging, from musique concrète to folk music to hardcore punk to classical to techno. Among the musicians Coil expressed interest in were early electronic, experimental and minimalist artists: Harry Partch, La Monte Young, Karlheinz Stockhausen (once referred to by Balance as ""an honorary member of Coil""), Alvin Lucier, and Arvo Pärt. Coil also expressed interest in krautrock groups including Cluster, Amon Düül II, Can, Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. Rock musicians and groups Coil have expressed interest in are: Angus Maclise, Captain Beefheart, Flipper, Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Nico, Pere Ubu, Butthole Surfers, Napalm Death, The Birthday Party, The Velvet Underground and The Virgin Prunes. Coil expressed an interest in the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and used a sample from his ballet Rite of Spring on the Horse Rotorvator song ""The Anal Staircase"". Furthermore, on the album Black Antlers Coil dedicated a song to Sun Ra and covered a song by Bam Bam.
Coil's influence on electronic music has become more evident since the death of Balance, with electronic musicians from all over the world collaborating on a series of tribute albums. Some notable artists who appear on these albums are Alec Empire, Chris Connelly and KK Null (see ...It Just Is). Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor also expressed the significant influence that the group had on his work in February 2014:

[Coil's] 'Tainted Love' video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it's not immediately obvious: Horse Rotorvator was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.
The track ""At the Heart of It All"" (found on Scatology) later lent its name to an Aphex Twin track on the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral; Coil also provided remixes for Further Down the Spiral as well as ""Gave Up"" on the remix album Fixed. Furthermore, in 2010, Reznor, Mariqueen Maandig and Atticus Ross started a new band called How to Destroy Angels—named after the Coil song—which received Christopherson's blessing after Reznor made contact with him.

Constance Demby,"Constance Mary Demby (née Eggers; May 9, 1939 – March 20, 2021) was an American musician, composer, painter, sculptor, and multimedia producer. Her music fell into several categories, most notably new age, ambient and space music. She is best known for her 1986 album Novus Magnificat and her two experimental musical instruments, the sonic steel space bass and the whale sail.

Early life
Demby was born in Oakland, California in May 1939. After the family moved to Connecticut, Demby began classical piano lessons at age 8, and soon became confident enough to perform solo and in a group. She continued with her music studies, during which Demby also took to painting and sculpture and received an Excellence in Art award for her work from Pine Manor College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Demby studied sculpture and painting at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where in 1960, she received a Highby Award for excellence in art.

Career
1960–1978: Early career
In 1960, Demby quit her studies and moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. She continued to work as a musician and sculptor, combining these disciplines with her first sheet metal sound sculptures, built in 1966. She had been torching a sheet of metal in her sculptural practice when she noticed the low tones and unusual sounds that the vibrating metal produced, which subsequently led to the development of her first handmade instruments. In 1967 Demby used these sculptures in a series of happening-style events at the Charles Street Gallery named A Fly Can't Bird But a Bird Can Fly, owned by Robert Rutman. In one piece called ""The Thing"", Rutman wore a white cardboard box and banged on Demby's sheet metal creation with ""a rock in a sock."" Demby conceived a multimedia environmental experience called Space Mass, which featured a 24-foot altar, temples, and sculptures that acted as moving screens to project abstract films. Demby welded a curved metal sheet to several steel rods which she played as a percussion instrument. Rutman later remarked, ""We thought it would sound good as a xylophone, but it didn't."" Throughout the decade Demby exhibited her work in solo and group settings in New York City, Boston, and Maine. In 1968, she held her first major solo show in New York City, combining her paintings, sculptures, and light and sound displays, by which time she had explored electronic music for the first time.
After moving to Maine with Rutman, in 1971 the duo formed the Central Maine Power Music Company (CMPMC), a multimedia sound and light group influenced by their previous Space Mass exhibit. They used uncommon eastern instruments combined with electronic music with video and laser light projections. They toured the eastern US extensively, with the group ranging from 6 to 20 members at any given performance. Among the guest musicians involved was hammer dulcimer player Dorothy Carter and video artist Bill Etra. The band toured the East Coast, playing at planetariums in Massachusetts, as well as Lincoln Center, the World Trade Center, and at the United Nations Sculpture Garden in New York City. Demby's co-founder told a reporter in 1974:

The best way to describe our music is to call it 'not music.' You see, it often happens that when people hear us play, they say, either in anger or in delight, 'That's not music!' It's somewhat akin to the paintings of Jackson Pollock. When the art buffs first saw his work, with the paint drippings and all, they said, 'That's not painting.'
In 1976, the CMPMC disbanded and its founders moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. While Rutman went on to pursue directions in contemporary classical and industrial music with the sheet metal instruments that they had created, Demby headed down a quieter path. She studied yoga with Ajaib Singh and, in 1977, co-formed the Gandharva Performing Arts Company, a duo featuring the flute, tabla and dulcimer with Robert Bennett.

1978–2017: Studio albums
By the late 1970s, Demby had become a multi-instrumentalist who was proficient in musical improvisation, vocals, hammered dulcimer, koto, tamboura, and various keyboards and synthesizers. She made her studio recording debut on Dorothy Carter's debut album, Troubadour (1976). Demby's first solo album, Skies Above Skies (1978), comprised devotional prayers set to music featuring hammer dulcimer, ch'eng, tambura, synthesizer, cello, piano, organ, and voice reciting lines from the Bible, Hindi scripture, and the Popol Vuh.
After a pilgrimage to India in 1979, Demby settled in Marin County, California, just north of San Francisco. She founded the record label Sound Currents to release her second album, Sunborne (1980), inspired by the Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean, a 20th century work by occultist Maurice Doreal. Her hammer dulcimer-oriented album Sacred Space Music (1982) followed on the Hearts of Space Records label. Demby performed at the Alaron Center in Sausalito, spawning her Live at Alaron (1984) album which displays themes the in her definitive studio album, Novus Magnificat (1986).
In 2000, Demby left California for Spain, eventually settling in Sitges near Barcelona. It was here where she recorded Sanctum Sanctuorum (2001), a reworked version of Faces of the Christ (2000) with added keyboard parts and choral and Gregorian chant.
Demby returned to the US in 2004, touring the West Coast presenting concerts and healing workshops. Her Sound Currents label subsequently released Sonic Immersion (2004), a vibrational sound healing attunement through use of the Space Bass.

Instrument design
In addition to her studio albums, Demby is best known for creating two experimental musical instruments: the Whale Sail and the Sonic Steel Space Bass. These 10-foot-long sheet metal idiophones are played with a bass bow to create low resonating tones. George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch licensed the sounds of the Space Bass for use in their film scores, and The Discovery Channel filmed the Space Bass in Gaudi's Park Güell in Barcelona for one of their specials. The Space Bass is also featured on the soundtrack for the IMAX film Chronos (1985), directed by Ron Fricke and featuring music by Michael Stearns.
The International Space Science Institute commissioned Demby to create a score for the film I AM, and Demby's album Spirit Trance (2004) features four selections from the film. The track ""Legend"" on the same album was composed for Alan Hauge's film James Dean – An American Legend, but due to complications with the James Dean Foundation the project was shelved.

Personal life and death
In 1961, Eggers married David Demby and they had one son, Joshua. The marriage ended in divorce in 1974. Demby died from complications of a heart attack in Pasadena, California, on March 20, 2021, at age 81. Demby's nephew is writer, editor, and publisher Dave Eggers.

Controlled Bleeding,"Controlled Bleeding was an experimental music group based in Massapequa, New York. The group was founded by Paul Lemos, the group's only consistent member. Most of Controlled Bleeding's released recordings feature two main collaborators, Chris Moriarty and vocalist Joe Papa, who both died in the late 2000s. In February 2020 Lemos announced that the band had dissolved.
Since their first full-length release in 1983, Controlled Bleeding released over 30 albums spanning several different genres, many of which were released on notable independent labels. Their cross-genre approach combined with the out-of-print status of many of the group's releases is reminiscent of the work of other experimental and cross-genre groups of the 80s and 90s such as Coil and Swans.

Recorded output
Controlled Bleeding have been highly prolific since 1983, putting out more than 30 full-length releases on labels such as Dossier, Wax Trax!, Subterranean, Soleilmoon, and Roadrunner. Due to the broad musical interests of the main collaborators, as well as the influence of the band's relationships with genre-focused labels like Wax Trax! and Roadrunner, Controlled Bleeding's total recorded output spans many different genres including harsh noise, dub, progressive rock, industrial dance, metal, gothic, darkwave, classical, sacred music, ambient, free jazz improvisation, and musique concrète. Through the 80s and 90s, the group jumped from genre to genre; they would often release two or more full-length albums of music in the same year featuring radically different musical styles.
Controlled Bleeding's music is difficult to categorize, not only because of the experimental and varied nature of their work, but also because of the confusing ways in which their music has been released over the years. Some of the band's releases are made of remixed earlier material from multiple other releases, sometimes with new or missing song titles. The band's full-length releases occasionally contain material that jumps abruptly between multiple disparate genres; most strikingly, tracks of harsh noise appear on releases that are otherwise not noise-based. Additionally, in some cases, later CD issues of their original LPs are renamed, heavily remixed, or feature different tracks altogether, due to the group's desire to ""improve"" earlier material.

Early trio: 1978–1980
Controlled Bleeding was originally formed in Boston around 1978 by Paul Lemos, Jack Salerno and Dave Southerland. Later, returning to Massapequa, New York, Lemos formed a group with old school friends, Gary Pecorino (organ) and Tony Meola (drums), and released a 7-inch EP called Wall of China Love Letter in 1980. This early incarnation played a kind of progressive-influenced art rock.
Music from these early years was issued on several of Controlled Bleeding's later releases. An LP called Lung Ties which documented some of this trio's live and studio recordings was released on Eksakt Records in 1985 under the band name ""Body Sink"". The 1994 reissue of Songs from the Ashes includes three bonus tracks of live recordings of the Lemos/Pecorino/Meola trio playing at the New York City club CBGB. In 2008, Controlled Bleeding released Before the Quiet, which consists of many of the Lung Ties LP tracks along with more 1978–1981 archive material. Some of this material is also included on the 4-LP box set Songs from a Sewer of Dreams, released in 2007.

Experimental phase: 1983–1988
By 1982 or 1983, Pecorino and Meola had left the group, and were replaced by two new musical collaborators: Joe Papa, a ""300-pound scat-singing eccentric"", and Chris Moriarty, a neighbor of Paul who originally filled in on drums. Paul Lemos met Joe Papa after putting an ad in a local music paper in search of a singer. From late 1983 until Moriarty's departure in 1994, all Controlled Bleeding releases featured at least Papa or Moriarty, and usually both.
The next four years of Controlled Bleeding's output strayed from the previous trio's art rock leanings into more experimental areas. During 1983 and 1984, the band released a series of live-to-two-track cassettes via labels like Inner-X-Musick, Broken Flag, and Ladd-Frith which featured layered, harsh industrial noise, sometimes mixed with guitar and Joe Papa's vocal work. In February 1985, the band's first full-length LP, Knees and Bones, was released by Hans Fahlberg on his Sweden-based record label Psychout Productions, featuring a particularly harsh wall of sound similar to the work of other American and Japanese harsh noise artists.
Their second LP, Body Samples, was completed in April 1985 and released on Germany's Dossier Records. Although most of the tracks on the album featured harsh sounds similar to their first LP, Body Samples also had more layered, textural moments, including melodic synthesizer-based ambience and primal drumming. According to the liner notes in the 1990 CD reissue of Body Samples, the layered approach on some tracks was due to the group's acquisition of a four-track reel-to-reel recorder, which gave the band more freedom than their previous live-to-cassette recording methods. Also during 1985, the band released Feet Hacked Rails on Dossier under the pseudonym ""The Art Barbeque"", which strayed further from noise into more melodic and rhythmic territory; some of the material from Feet Hacked Rails appears on the 1990 CD reissue of Body Samples, along with some tracks from the earlier cassette-only release Shitslipper.
In 1986 and 1987, Controlled Bleeding released five more full-length LPs: Curd (1986, Dossier), Headcrack (1986, Sterile Records), Between Tides (1986, Multimood), Core (1987, Subterranean), and Songs from the Drain (1987, Dossier). Paul Lemos has stated that these releases contain music made by the band throughout 1984–1987, so an exact chronology of the material made during this time period is not known. Beginning with Curd, the band left the distortion-heavy noise of their previous releases behind in favor of a more varied experimental approach. Core is notable as the first Controlled Bleeding vinyl LP to be released by a label based in the United States, although some of the group's early cassettes and compilations were released stateside a few years earlier.
Headcrack is the first record released by Controlled Bleeding that demonstrates the classical/medieval/sacred music influences which would reappear throughout their discography, and the album features Joe Papa's wordless vocals more prominently than any previous release. A similar sound to Headcrack was also featured on Music for Stolen Icons, a 12-inch EP released by the band on Sub Rosa in 1986 under the name ""Paul Lemos & Joe Papa"".
In 1988 and 1989, the band released two LPs on the Belgian label Sub Rosa, Music from the Scourging Ground (1988) and Music for Gilded Chambers (1989). These LPs continued the band's exploration of medieval and sacred music and mixed it with soundtrack-like ambient passages. Also, most notably, these were the first two Controlled Bleeding albums to feature songs with lyrics. These two releases were remixed and combined for the US CD-only release Songs from the Ashes (C'est La Mort, 1990).

Availability on CD
Some of the band's first nine LPs were later issued on CD in various forms. Some of the original tracks were not included in the CD versions, and some material was remixed and/or edited.

Industrial dance and metal phase (1989–1993)
Industrial dance
From 1988 to 1990, Controlled Bleeding made another strong stylistic shift and recorded several releases of metal-tinged industrial dance music which were released on Wax Trax! Records. Thanks to the label's large advertising budget and a favorable critical response, this material provided the highest record sales of the band's career thus far, and gave the band a worldwide reputation as an industrial dance act. The first EP in this style, Songs from the Grinding Wall (1989), was heavily promoted by the label, and was followed by a full-length release, Trudge (1989), which the label promoted further by issuing 12-inch singles for the album tracks ""The Fodder Song"" and ""Words (of the Dying)"".
In addition to a heavier use of MIDI sequencing and sampling, these were the first Controlled Bleeding recordings to prominently feature Chris Moriarty's vocals, and Moriarty and Lemos shared lead vocal duties throughout. They also used lyrics a lot more often, signaling a departure from the often wordless vocals provided by Joe Papa on previous releases. Lemos and Moriarty later released a side project EP, Joined at the Head (1990, Wax Trax!), which blended Trudge sounds with more metal and thrash influences. These Wax Trax! releases were later reissued on the CD compilation Buried Blessings (1993, Cleopatra), although ""Healing Time"" and ""Christ Said"" from Trudge were omitted.
Two of the J.A.T.H. tracks would later appear on their next industrial dance album Penetration (1992, Third Mind Records), which introduced a slight hip hop influence along with updated electronic rhythms.

Skin Chamber
Between Trudge and Penetration, Lemos and Moriarty recorded a collection of grindcore demos in their home studio under the band name ""Fat Hacker"" and sent them to the A&R at Roadrunner Records, not expecting much of a response. To their surprise, the label showed interest, and the duo spent several months refining their metal experiments into an album, now working under the name Skin Chamber. The resulting album, Wound (1991), was influenced heavily by industrial metal bands such as Swans and Godflesh, and was relatively commercially successful. Skin Chamber's second album, Trial (1993, Roadrunner), was recorded with a larger budget, and although it displayed a wider variety of influences and sonic textures as well as an inspired vocal appearance by Joe Papa, it was not received as favorably by fans or critics.

Compilations and other releases
In addition to the five releases mentioned above, Controlled Bleeding found the time to release even more music during this five-year period. In 1990, compilations of songs from their career thus far were released in Italy (Gag, Material Sonori Records) and the United States (Hog Floor (A Fractured View), Subterranean). The band also issued the aforementioned reworked CD versions of Body Samples and Curd during this time.
Two harsh noise releases would also appear during this time; an archival release of outtakes from the 1983 Knees and Bones recording sessions called Phlegm Bag Spattered  (1990, Dark Vinyl), and a mixed release of new and archival noise recordings on Japan's Vanilla Records called Bladder Bags and Interludes (1992).
In 1989, the first solo album by Paul Lemos, Sludge (1989, Dossier) was released, displaying strong industrial dance influences on side A and dark ambient/soundtrack work on side B. Lemos later released another solo album, Phlegm Dive (1992, Dossier) which was composed largely of demo and alternate versions of previously released tracks.
Although the industrial dance and metal releases were mainly a collaboration between Paul Lemos and Chris Moriarty, Lemos and Joe Papa split off to write and record two new albums of ambient and medieval-influenced music during this same time period on two new record labels: Golgotha (1991, Staalplaat) and Music for Stolen Icons II (1993, Artware, released as ""Paul Lemos & Joe Papa""). One track from Golgotha, ""Awakened Beneath the Ground"", would also appear at the end of Penetration.

Dark ambient and dub: 1994–1997
After the cooler-than-expected reception of the second Skin Chamber album, Paul Lemos became disenchanted with industrial dance and metal, and perhaps as a result, his collaborations with Chris Moriarty slowed considerably at this time. The next Controlled Bleeding album, The Drowning (1994, Dark Vinyl) clearly signalled Lemos's intent to return to more experimental waters: the 40-second industrial dance track that begins the album makes a sudden, unexpected transition to eight minutes of some of the harshest noise sounds that Controlled Bleeding ever recorded. The rest of the album was filled with dark ambience, noise, and cavernous rhythms, unaccompanied by lyrics and using very few vocal sounds.
The Drowning would be the last time in Controlled Bleeding's catalog that Moriarty would be listed as a band member on a collection of new music. He went on to release a solo album, Grip Life, the next year under the band name ""Body Clock"", a mixed collection of musical styles which featured guest appearances by Lemos on guitar and Chris's friend Stephanie Trang Dinh on vocals.
Later in 1994, the band released two more reissues of earlier albums. Songs from the Vault, released on Dark Vinyl Records, was a collection of remixed tracks from Headcrack and Music for Stolen Icons I. The second reissue, Songs from the Drain (Dossier), began with three newly recorded tracks, the first of which was a demonstration of a brand new sound for Controlled Bleeding: dub music. Lemos and Papa would focus and refine their brand of dub on their next full-length, Dub Songs from a Shallow Grave (1995, Dossier), which was composed almost completely of electronic dub songs with Papa on vocals.
The next official album by the band was a two-CD set on Hypnotic records called Inanition. The first disc was entirely new music, and was composed of two new dub tracks sandwiched between two very long pieces of ambient music, in a style and pacing reminiscent of many of Bill Laswell's ambient dub projects. Stephanie Trang Dinh, who was a guest on Moriarty's solo album, also made her first appearance with the group here on vocals. The second disc was a compilation of ambient tracks from their entire career, dating as far back as 1986's Curd.
Also in 1996, Lemos and Papa released Songs from the Shadows on Death Factory/Cold Meat Industries under the pseudonym ""In Blind Embrace"", which was a more gothic-sounding album that harkened back to the songs featured on Songs from the Ashes; appropriately, the album featured a guest appearance by vocalist Rozz Williams. This album was later re-released in 2008 on MVD Audio under the name ""Controlled Bleeding - In Blind Embrace"".
The last two albums of this period were released in 1997. Gilded Shadows (Hypnotic) was another full-length electronic dub effort, once again featuring both Joe Papa and Stephanie Trang Dinh on vocals. Their final album of this period, The Poisoner (Soleilmoon), consisted of two long dark ambient tracks, was the most soundtrack-like of any Controlled Bleeding release and featured San Diego experimental composer Guy Lohnes on processed guitar, as well as Stephanie Trang Dinh on vocals. These two albums, although falling into different genres, were both carefully recorded over a longer period of time than most previous albums by the group, and were very stylistically consistent; as such, they received some of the best reviews of Controlled Bleeding's career.

Inactive: 1997–2002
After the release of Gilded Shadows and The Poisoner in 1997, Lemos took a break from making music, and put Controlled Bleeding on hold. According to later interviews, this break was due to a lack of musical inspiration that set in after working so hard on the last two releases.
In 1999, a two-CD ""best-of"" collection was released on Cleopatra Records called Rest in Peace: The Best of Controlled Bleeding. The first disc, ""Hard Rhythms and Noise"", was a retrospective of the band's industrial dance, metal, and noise periods, and the second disc, ""Dark Voices and Instrumentals"", focused on the band's sacred music, gothic, and dark ambient work. Furthermore, the liner notes announced that Controlled Bleeding was officially deactivated as a musical project.
The next year, a compilation of dub music from Dub Songs from a Shallow Grave, Inanition, and Gilded Shadows called Our Journey's End was released on Material Sonori. This release also included a cover of ""The Talking Drum"" by King Crimson, which also appeared on the Rest in Peace compilation, and featured Chris Moriarty on drum programming. Although this release was a compilation of previously released tracks, no song titles were included, and the liner notes did not state that the material was previously released. Slightly surprisingly, this release was credited to ""The Controlled Bleeding"", and was the first time that ""The"" appeared before the band name on any release.

Reactivation: 2002–2009
After a five-year hiatus, Controlled Bleeding released an album of new music entitled Can You Smell the Rain Between (2002, Tone Casualties), once again using the name ""The Controlled Bleeding"". Straying again from the cohesion of their 1997 releases, Lemos and Papa included tracks of ambient music, dub, and free jazz-inspired live improvisation. The album includes remixes of material from The Poisoner featuring guitarist Guy Lohnes, and Tatsuya Yoshida of Ruins makes a guest appearance on drums on the track ""Felch Space Scan"". The release includes a cover of ""Here Come the Warm Jets"" by Brian Eno.
In early 2003, the trio of Lemos, Papa, and Yoshida released a full-length free jazz-inspired effort under the project name Breast Fed Yak called Get Your Greasy Head Off the Sham. This release expands upon the sounds and ideas of the more chaotic, improvisational tracks on their 2002 album, and is based entirely on live instrumentation and Joe Papa's unusually rapid scat singing.
Although no new material was released after their 2003 album, Papa and Lemos made some live appearances as Breast Fed Yak in 2006, featuring Kim Abrams and Ron Anderson of PAK.

Compilations
Many reissues of older Controlled Bleeding material in various forms has appeared more recently. Shanked and Slithering (2005, Hospital Productions) is a compilation of previously released and unreleased noise material mostly from 1983 to 1986 which has been entirely remixed and remastered.
In November 2007, the vinyl-only label Vinyl on Demand issued a limited 4-LP set composed of unreleased live and studio archive material called Songs from a Sewer of Dreams. There is a full LP of brand new music included with this box, as well as 3 LPs of recent and older archive material.
Before the Quiet (2008, MVD Audio) collects a full-length CD of material from the Lemos/Meola/Pecorino trio lineup of 1978–1981.
Finally, a 4-CD compilation on Hong Kong label Ultra Mail Productions called Gibbering Canker-Opera Slaves was released in 2009, featuring both remastered cassette-only tracks and a large amount of new and old unreleased material; the track selection on this CD box set slightly overlaps the material on the LP box set Songs from a Sewer of Dreams. The box set is limited to 400 copies, 200 of which include a bonus 5th disc and are signed by Paul Lemos.
Although Chris Moriarty and Paul Lemos had begun talking about reforming Skin Chamber, Moriarty died in Phoenix, Arizona on March 22, 2008. Joe Papa died on November 23, 2009.

Current status
Beginning in early 2010, Lemos began improvisational collaborations with Ron Anderson of PAK and Weasel Walter, and began preparing EPs of new material for Soleilmoon and Rich Black's label Winged Disk. Black compiled a series of short videos to go along with the group's short, layered pieces entitled ""Bees (1-6)"", which was posted on YouTube. (Bees (1-6) video)
In 2011, Lemos formed a new trio with original drummer Tony Meola (who played drums in the very early years) and keyboardist Mike Bazini of Dystopia One, and recorded a new set of material with producer Martin Bisi (Swans, The Young Gods), which was released as ""Odes to Bubbler"" (Winged Disk / Soleilmoon, 2011). The new trio played several live dates in the NYC area in that year, including shows at Cake Shop NYC and Silent Barn in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
In 2012 Paul Lemos with Meola, Bazini and also Chvad SB set up a sort of constant new band. With this line up the group released a very strange split album with the Italian experimental band Sparkle in Grey (""Perversions of The Aging Savant"", Off Records / Old Bicycle Records, 2015) and then a full new record titled ""Larva Lumps and Baby Bumps"" (Artoffact Records, 2016).
As of 2019, Lemos is a high-school English Literature teacher on Long Island, New York.
In 2018 Controlled Bleeding added new drummer Michael Larocca to the band. The new line-up consisting of Lemos, Bazini, Chvad SB and Larocca performed at the Deathfests Days of Darkness festival in Baltimore, MD. in October 2018.
On February 11, 2020, Lemos announced the end of the band, citing frustrations with live performances. While admitting the band has plenty of unreleased music, there is no certainty as to if or when it will ever be released.

Craig Chaquico,"Craig Clinton Chaquico (or Chaquiço,  chə-KEE-soh; born September 26, 1954) is an American guitarist, songwriter, and composer. From 1974 to 1990 he was lead guitarist for the rock bands Jefferson Starship and Starship. In 1993, he started a solo career as an acoustic jazz guitarist and composer.

Early life
Chaquico was born and raised in Sacramento, California and attended La Sierra High School in the suburb of Carmichael. His mother, Muriel, was a state government employee, and his father, Bill, owned an upholstery business. Both were of Portuguese descent. He had an older brother named Howard. The household was a musical one; Chaquico recalls, ""My mom and dad were musicians and played around the house all the time. I thought everybody played the piano and organ like Mom and the sax and accordion like Dad together after dinner."" He began playing the guitar as a young boy, when his parents bought him his first guitar at the age of ten.
When Chaquico was twelve, the car he and his father were traveling in was hit head-on by a drunk driver. Both of his arms were broken, as were his leg, ankle, foot, wrist, and thumb. During physical therapy, his father told him that guitarist Les Paul had been in a car accident and had played guitar to help himself heal. His father promised to buy him a Les Paul guitar when he got better. Although he could play only the high E string of his acoustic guitar due to his casts, he benefited from playing and his father kept his word about the Les Paul.

Career
Chaquico began performing in clubs in his teens. His English teacher Jack Traylor asked him to join the band Steelwind, which performed in Sacramento and San Francisco Bay, and Traylor introduced him to Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane. Kantner invited him to a series of recording sessions. At 16 he recorded for the first time with Kantner and Grace Slick on their albums Sunfighter and Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun. He played on Slick's solo album Manhole in 1973. He played alongside Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, David Freiberg, and Carlos Santana.
After Jefferson Airplane broke up, its remaining members formed Jefferson Starship. Chaquico joined the band in 1974. Jefferson Starship released nine platinum and gold selling albums between 1974 and 1984, including Red Octopus, which was certified double-platinum in 1995. He wrote or co-wrote ""Fast Buck Freddy"", ""Love Too Good"", ""Rock Music"", ""Jane"", ""Find Your Way Back"", and ""Layin' It on the Line"".

The name ""Jefferson Starship"" was retired in March 1985 after Kantner left the band and sued the remaining members, who reformed under the name ""Starship"". All other band members, including Chaquico, remained with the band. Starship recorded hits such as ""We Built This City"", ""Sara"", and ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"". Chaquico and Starship appeared on MTV videos on a regular basis and performed at the first MTV Spring Break special in Daytona Beach in 1986. Chaquico left Starship in 1990.
Having become disappointed with the direction Starship was going, Chaquico formed Big Bad Wolf and recorded one album in that band. He began a solo career that explored world music, new age, and contemporary jazz. His first album, Acoustic Highway (1993), was the number one Independent New Age Album of the Year in Billboard Magazine and a number one on the Billboard New Age Albums chart, while his second album, Acoustic Planet (1994), reached number one on the same chart and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Age Album. The album borrowed from African and Native American music. The song ""Just One World"" was launched into space on a satellite that was part of NASA's Space Ark program.
In 2017 Chaquico filed suit against the remaining members of Jefferson Starship, including David Freiberg and Donny Baldwin, over the use of the band name on tour billings and merchandise, citing the 1985 agreement to retire the band name. In 2018 the suit was dismissed after an undisclosed settlement was reached.

Guitars
Chaquico's first guitar was a Winston acoustic which his mother bought for him when he was 10 years old after he'd given up his parents' idea that he would play an accordion. He played a '57 Les Paul Goldtop on the first two Jefferson Starship albums and tours, Dragon Fly (1974) and Red Octopus (1975), on such songs as ""Miracles"". He also soon added a rare '59 Les Paul Sunburst to his collection which he played on the next two albums, Spitfire (1976) and Earth (1978) and can be heard on such songs as ""With Your Love"", ""Count on Me"", and ""Runaway"". Both Les Paul Guitars and the Bassman amps, along with several other valuable guitars, were stolen and/or destroyed in a riot in Lorelei, Germany, in 1978, when Grace Slick was unable to perform and the show was cancelled. Into the '80s, Chaquico was sponsored by Carvin Guitars and often appeared on tour, in the studio and in guitar magazine ads playing a Carvin V220 or a Carvin koa doubleneck played through Carvin amplifiers, his favorite being the Carvin X100B.

Philanthropy
Chaquico became a believer in the healing power of music after recovering from a car crash when he was twelve. With the National Association of Music Therapy, Beamz, Remo, and Washburn Guitars, he provided instruments to patients in hospitals. He has worked with organizations such as the American Music Therapy Association and Memory and Music which use music therapy with injured and traumatized people and those with various forms of dementia.

Awards and honors
Jazziz Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential jazz guitarists of all time. He was named Best Pop Instrumental Guitarist in Guitar Player magazine's 1997 Readers' Poll.

DJ Spooky,"Paul Dennis Miller (born September 6, 1970), known professionally as DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, is an American electronic and experimental hip hop musician whose work is often called by critics ""illbient"" or ""trip hop"". He is a turntablist, record producer, philosopher, and author. He borrowed his stage name from the character The Subliminal Kid in the novel Nova Express by William S. Burroughs. Having studied philosophy and French literature at Bowdoin College, he has become a professor of Music Mediated Art at the European Graduate School and is the executive editor of Origin magazine.

Career
Spooky began writing science fiction and formed a collective called Soundlab with several other artists.
In the mid-1990s, Spooky began recording a series of singles and EPs. His debut LP was Songs of a Dead Dreamer. Spooky contributed to the AIDS benefit albums Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip (1996) and Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon (1998) produced by the Red Hot Organization. Riddim Warfare included collaborations with Kool Keith and other figures in indie rock, including Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore. In 2001, he released the CD Under the Influence.
He returned in 2002 with Modern Mantra. That same year saw the release of Optometry, a collaboration with avant-jazz players Matthew Shipp, William Parker, Guillermo E. Brown and Joe McPhee. In a classical vein, he collaborated with the ST-X Ensemble in performances of the music of Iannis Xenakis. 
DJ Spooky collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto on projects including The Discord Symphony. The concert and album were released as an enhanced CD containing both a full audio program and multimedia computer files. It features spoken-word performances by Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Patti Smith, David Sylvian, DJ Spooky, David Torn, and Bernardo Bertolucci.

DJ Spooky joined the ninth and eleventh annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers. He was also a judge for the third Independent Music Awards.
DJ Spooky has said that much of his work ""deals with the notion of the encoded gesture or the encrypted psychology of how music affects the whole framework of what the essence of 'humaness'  [sic] is... To me at this point in the 21st century, the notion of the encoded sound is far more of a dynamic thing, especially when you have these kinds of infodispersion systems running, so I'm fascinated with the unconscious at this point.""

Other work
His work as an artist has appeared in a variety of contexts such as the Whitney Biennial; the Venice Biennale; the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany; Kunsthalle, Vienna; The Andy Warhol Museum; Paula Cooper Gallery; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and many other museums and galleries. In 2007, his work appeared in the Africa Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennial. This remix of music from Africa was also distributed freely online, and promoted by the blog Boing Boing.

In 2006, the song ""Battle of Erishkigal"", co-written by DJ Spooky and Frank Fitzpatrick, was featured in the anime-inspired film The Rebel Angel.
In August 2009, DJ Spooky visited the Republic of Nauru in the Micronesian South Pacific to do research and gather material for a project in development, with a working title of The Nauru Elegies: A Portrait in Sound and Hypsographic Architecture.

Lanois has released several solo albums. He wrote and performed the music for the 1996 film Sling Blade.

Biography
Early life and career
Lanois was born in 1951 at Hull, Quebec to Jill and Guy Lanois. Lanois started his production career when he was 17, recording local artists including Simply Saucer with his brother Bob Lanois in a studio in the basement of their mother's home in Ancaster, Ontario. Later, Lanois started Grant Avenue Studio in an old house which he purchased in Hamilton, Ontario. He worked with a number of local bands, including Martha and the Muffins (for whom his sister Jocelyne played bass), Ray Materick, Spoons, and the Canadian children's singer Raffi. Lanois attended Ancaster High School.

Producer
In 1981, Lanois played on and produced the album This Is the Ice Age by Martha and the Muffins. In 1985, he and two members of the band earned a CASBY award for their work on the band's (by then going by ""M + M"") 1984 album Mystery Walk.
Lanois worked collaboratively with Brian Eno on some of Eno's own projects, one of which was the ""Prophecy Theme"" for David Lynch's film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune. Eno invited him to co-produce U2's album The Unforgettable Fire.  Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2's The Joshua Tree, the 1987 Grammy Award for Album of the Year winner, and some of the band's other works including Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind, both of which were nominated for the same award but did not win. Lanois once again collaborated with U2 and Brian Eno on the band's 2009 album, No Line on the Horizon. He was involved in the songwriting process as well as mixing and production.
Lanois' early work with U2 led to him being hired to produce albums for other top-selling artists. He collaborated with Peter Gabriel on his album Birdy (1985), the soundtrack to Alan Parker's film of the same name, and then spent most of 1985 co-producing Gabriel's album So. The album was released in 1986 and became his best-selling release, earning multi-platinum sales and a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Lanois later co-produced Gabriel's follow-up, Us which was released in 1992 and also went platinum.
Bono recommended Lanois to Bob Dylan in the late 1980s; in 1989, Lanois produced Dylan's Oh Mercy. Eight years later, Dylan and Lanois worked together on Time Out of Mind, which won another Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997. In his autobiographical Chronicles, Vol. 1, Dylan describes in depth the contentious but rewarding working relationship he developed with Lanois.
Wrecking Ball, his 1995 collaboration with Emmylou Harris, won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 1998, he produced and appeared on Willie Nelson's album Teatro.
Lanois was working on Neil Young's record Le Noise in June 2010 when he was hospitalized after suffering multiple injuries in a motorcycle crash in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles.
He has since recovered.
Lanois' production is recognizable and notable for its 'big' and 'live' drum sound, atmospheric guitars and ambient reverb. Rolling Stone called Lanois the ""most important record producer to emerge in the Eighties.""

Recording artist
As well as being a producer, Lanois is a songwriter, musician and recording artist. He has released several solo albums and film scores; his first album, Acadie was released in 1989. A number of Lanois' songs have been covered by other artists, including Dave Matthews, Jerry Garcia Band, Willie Nelson, Tea Party, Anna Beljin, Isabelle Boulay, and Emmylou Harris. His albums have had some success, particularly in Canada. Lanois plays the guitar, pedal steel, and drums. Belladonna, an instrumental album released in 2005 was nominated for a Grammy.
Lanois' song ""Sonho Dourado"" was included in the 2004 Billy Bob Thornton film, Friday Night Lights. In 2005 with the re-release of his first solo album, Acadie, a late-1980s version of the song appears on the additional tracks called ""Early Dourado Sketch"". Lanois had performed the song numerous times in the intervening years, including on a Toronto television program in 1993 where it was credited as ""Irish Melody"" on a recording of the performance. Though the melody does indeed feel Irish, the title is Portuguese and means golden dream.
Lanois also provided an instrumental score for LOUDquietLOUD, a 2006 documentary about the Pixies.
Lanois premiered a documentary entitled Here Is What Is at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2007. The film chronicles the recording of his album of the same name and includes footage of the actual recording. The album Here Is What Is was released, first by download, then on compact disc, in late 2007 and early 2008. Soon after that, Lanois released a three-disc recording called Omni.
In October 2009, Lanois started a project called Black Dub which features Lanois on guitar, Brian Blade on drums, and Daryl Johnson on bass, along with multi-instrumentalist/singer Trixie Whitley. They released a self-titled album in 2010. In 2014, Lanois played with Emmylou Harris as a sideman and opening act on a tour focused on the Wrecking Ball material he produced.

Solo career
On October 28, 2014, Lanois released an album titled Flesh and Machine on ANTI- Records, based on Brian Eno's ambient albums. The  instrumental album consists primarily of original atmospheric and process-based sounds, blending pedal steel guitar and a variety of digital and analog sound processing devices. He was assisted by the drummer Brian Blade. In 2016, he released the album Goodbye to Language with Rocco Deluca.
The collaborative album Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois was released on Venetian Snares' label Timesig in May 2018.
Lanois also contributed to the composition and production of the soundtrack for the 2018 video game Red Dead Redemption 2, released by Rockstar Games. He was given seven composition credits, including one for the song ""Table Top"".

Awards
Lanois was invested in the Order of Canada in 2018.
Lanois won a Juno Award in 1990 as most promising artist.
Lanois has received seven Grammy Awards for his work with various artists, including Bob Dylan, U2, Emmylou Harris and Neil Young.

David Bowie,"David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie ( BOH-ee), was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. He is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.
Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a solo album before achieving his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart with ""Space Oddity"" (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of ""Starman"" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. ""Heroes"" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Phillip Jeffries in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), Andy Warhol in the biopic Basquiat (1996), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with The Next Day and remained musically active until his death from liver cancer in 2016. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar.
During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Often dubbed the ""chameleon of rock"" due to his constant musical reinventions, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

Early life
David Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary ""Peggy"" (née Burns), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton ""John"" Jones, was from Doncaster, Yorkshire, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.
From 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common, before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered ""adequate"" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations ""vividly artistic"" and his poise ""astonishing"" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song ""Tutti Frutti"", Bowie later said that he had ""heard God"".
Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to ""Hound Dog"" soon after its release in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David ""danced like possessed elves"" to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as ""mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet"". Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele. After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School. It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:

Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] public school. There were houses named after eighteenth-century statesmen like Pitt and Wilberforce. There was a uniform and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, Peter, to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.
Bowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life. Burns, who was 10 years older than Bowie, had schizophrenia and seizures, and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as modern jazz, Buddhism, Beat poetry and the occult. In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a lobotomy; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.
Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross.
He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.

Music career
1962–1967: Early career to debut album
Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them. When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to ""do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million."" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.
Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single, ""Liza Jane"", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—""I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger"", he recalled. Their cover of Bobby Bland's ""I Pity the Fool"" was no more successful than ""Liza Jane"", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who. ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world ""to study mime at Sadler's Wells"", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with Pye Records. Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs. Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees, he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised. His first release under the name was the January 1966 single ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", recorded with the Lower Third. It flopped like its predecessors.
Bowie departed the Lower Third after the single's release, partly due to Horton's influence, and released two more singles for Pye, ""Do Anything You Say"" and ""I Dig Everything"", both of which featured a new band called the Buzz, before signing with Deram Records. Around this time Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by the Velvet Underground, went unreleased. Kenneth Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager. His April 1967 solo single, ""The Laughing Gnome"", on which speeded-up and high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, David Bowie, an amalgam of pop, psychedelia and music hall, met the same fate. It was his last release for two years. In September, Bowie recorded ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" and ""Karma Man"", both rejected by Deram and left unreleased until 1970. The tracks marked the beginning of Bowie's working relationship with producer Tony Visconti which, with large gaps, lasted for the rest of Bowie's career.

1968–1971: Space Oddity to Hunky Dory
Studying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, his composition ""Over the Wall We Go"" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, ""Silly Boy Blue"", was released by Billy Fury the following year. Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.
After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan's duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street. The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement, developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song ""Memory of a Free Festival"".

Pitt attempted to introduce Bowie to a larger audience with the Love You till Tuesday film, which went unreleased until 1984. Feeling alienated over his unsuccessful career and deeply affected by his break-up, Bowie wrote ""Space Oddity"", a tale about a fictional astronaut named Major Tom. The song earned him a contract with Mercury Records and its UK subsidiary Philips, who issued ""Space Oddity"" as a single on 11 July 1969, five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch. Reaching the top five in the UK, it was his first and last hit for three years. Bowie's second album followed in November. Originally issued in the UK as David Bowie, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the US release was instead titled Man of Words/Man of Music; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by RCA Records as Space Oddity. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time.
Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate—he wrote his 1970 single ""The Prettiest Star"" for her—and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with ""Space Oddity"", Bowie desired a full-time band he could record with and could relate to personally. The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype, the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style, leading to his replacement by Mick Woodmansey. Not long after, Bowie fired his manager and replaced him with Tony Defries. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.
The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World (1970), which contained references to schizophrenia, paranoia and delusion. It represented a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by his second album, to a more hard rock sound. Mercury financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across the US in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by media. Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted Bowie wearing a dress. He took the dress with him and wore it during interviews, to the approval of critics – including Rolling Stone's John Mendelsohn, who described him as ""ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall"".

During the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing ""the ultimate pop idol"". A girlfriend recalled his ""scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy"", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character ""who looks like he's landed from Mars"". The ""Stardust"" surname was a tribute to the ""Legendary Stardust Cowboy"", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie later covered ""I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship"" on 2002's Heathen.
Hunky Dory (1971) found Visconti supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott producing and Trevor Bolder on bass. It again featured a stylistic shift towards art pop and melodic pop rock, with light fare tracks such as ""Kooks"", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with ""Song for Bob Dylan"", ""Andy Warhol"" and ""Queen Bitch"", the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche. His first release through RCA, it was a commercial failure, partly due lack of promotion from the label. Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits covered the album's track  ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", which reached number 12 in the UK.

1972–1974: Glam rock era
Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by David Buckley, a ""cult of Bowie"" that was ""unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock. ""Starman"", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory. At the same time, the non-album single ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and ""All the Young Dudes"", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.
Bowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards and guitar to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer, co-producing the album with Ronson. The following year, Bowie co-produced and mixed the Stooges' album Raw Power alongside Iggy Pop. His own Aladdin Sane (1973) was his first UK number-one album. Described by Bowie as ""Ziggy goes to America"", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles ""The Jean Genie"" and ""Drive-In Saturday"".
Bowie's love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. ""Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David."" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, ""wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."" His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage ""retirement"" at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was incorporated for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983.

After breaking up the Spiders, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity. Hunky Dory's ""Life on Mars?"" was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Entering the same chart in September, his 1967 novelty record ""The Laughing Gnome"" reached number six. Pin Ups, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in his version of the McCoys's ""Sorrow"" and itself peaking at number one, making Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.

1974–1976: ""Plastic soul"" and the Thin White Duke
Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""Diamond Dogs"", and number five in the US. The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled ""David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory"". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd's ""Knock on Wood"". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.

The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans (1975). Sandford writes, ""Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."" The album's sound, which Bowie identified as ""plastic soul"", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK and yielded Bowie's first US number one, ""Fame"", a collaboration with John Lennon. A re-issue of the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after ""Fame"" achieved the same in the US. He mimed ""Fame"" and his November single ""Golden Years"" on the US variety show Soul Train, earning him the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the programme. The same year, Bowie fired Defries as his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, ""millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered"" in what were ""uniquely generous terms for Defries"", then ""shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."" Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman, in turn, was awarded substantial compensation when he was fired the following year.

Station to Station (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, introduced a new Bowie persona, the Thin White Duke of its title track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year. Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans, Station to Station's synthesiser-heavy arrangements were influenced by electronic and German krautrock. Bowie's cocaine addiction during this period was at its peak; he often did not sleep for three to four days at a time during Station to Station's recording sessions and later said he remembered ""only flashes"" of its making. His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he referenced the drug directly in the album's ten-minute title track. The album's release was followed by a 3+1⁄2-month-long concert tour, the Isolar Tour, of Europe and North America. The core band that coalesced to record the album and tour—rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray and drummer Dennis Davis—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. Bowie performed on stage as the Thin White Duke.

The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that ""Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader"", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the ""Victoria Station incident"". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his cocaine addiction, the character of the Thin White Duke and his life living in Los Angeles, a city he later said ""should be wiped off the face of the Earth"". He later apologised for these statements, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. Nevertheless, his comments on fascism, as well as Eric Clapton's alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976, led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism.

1976–1979: Berlin era
In August 1976, Bowie moved to West Berlin with his old friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their respective drug addictions and escape the spotlight. Bowie's interest in German krautrock and the ambient works of multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno culminated in the first of three albums, co-produced with Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy. The album, Low (1977), was recorded in France and took influence from krautrock and experimental music and featured both short song-fragments and ambient instrumentals. Before its recording, Bowie produced Iggy Pop's debut solo album The Idiot, described by Pegg as ""a stepping stone between Station to Station and Low"". Low was completed in November, but left unreleased for three months. RCA did not see the album as commercially viable and were expecting another success following Young Americans and Station to Station. Bowie's former manager Tony Defries, who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowie's affairs, also tried to prevent. Upon its release in January 1977, Low yielded the UK number three single ""Sound and Vision"", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two. Bowie himself did not promote it, instead touring with Pop as his keyboardist throughout March and April before recording Pop's follow-up, Lust for Life.

Echoing Low's minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, ""Heroes"" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp. It was the only album recorded entirely in Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title track was released in both German and French and, though only reached number 24 in the UK singles chart, later became one of his best-known tracks. In contrast to Low, Bowie promoted ""Heroes"" extensively, performing the title track on Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in ""Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy"", a version of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" with a new, contrapuntal verse. RCA belatedly released the recording as a single five years later in 1982, charting in the UK at number three.

After completing Low and ""Heroes"", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that Isolar II was ""Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."" Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year. Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition Peter and the Wolf, which was released as an album in May 1978.
The final piece in what Bowie called his ""triptych"", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of its two predecessors, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno's Oblique Strategies cards: ""Boys Keep Swinging"" entailed band members swapping instruments, ""Move On"" used the chords from Bowie's early composition ""All the Young Dudes"" played backwards, and ""Red Money"" took backing tracks from The Idiot's ""Sister Midnight"". The album was recorded in Switzerland and New York City. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman described it as ""a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology."" Lodger reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles ""Boys Keep Swinging"" and ""DJ"". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980. The three albums were later adapted into classical music symphonies by American composer Philip Glass for his first, fourth and twelfth symphonies in 1992, 1997 and 2019, respectively. Glass praised Bowie's gift for creating ""fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces"".

1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era
Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number one single ""Ashes to Ashes"", featuring the textural guitar-synthesiser work of Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from ""Space Oddity"". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club ""Blitz""—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Fripp and Pete Townshend. Topping the UK Albums Chart for the first time since Diamond Dogs, Buckley writes that with Scary Monsters, Bowie achieved ""the perfect balance"" of creativity and mainstream success.
Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, ""Under Pressure"". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play was released as Baal. In March 1982, Bowie's title song for Paul Schrader's film Cat People was released as a single. A collaboration with Giorgio Moroder, it became a minor US hit and charted in the UK top 30. The same year, he departed RCA, having grown increasingly dissatisfied with them, and signed a new contract with EMI America Records for a reported $17 million. His 1975 severance settlement with Defries also ended in September.

Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. ""Modern Love"" and ""China Girl"" each made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of ""absorbing"" music videos that Buckley said ""activated key archetypes in the pop world... 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aboriginal couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene... was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV"". Then-unknown Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan guested on the album, featuring prominently on the title track. Let's Dance was followed by the six-month Serious Moonlight Tour, which was extremely successful. At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie received two awards including the inaugural Video Vanguard Award.
Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Pop and Tina Turner. Co-produced by Hugh Padgham, it included a number of cover songs, including three Pop covers and the 1966 Beach Boys hit ""God Only Knows"". The album bore the transatlantic top 10 hit ""Blue Jean"", itself the inspiration for the Julien Temple-directed short film Jazzin' for Blue Jean, in which Bowie played the dual roles of romantic protagonist Vic and arrogant rock star Screaming Lord Byron. The short won Bowie his only non-posthumous Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. In early 1985, Bowie's collaboration with the Pat Metheny Group, ""This Is Not America"", for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman, was released as a single and became a top 40 hit in the UK and US. In July that year, Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. Bowie and Mick Jagger duetted on a cover of Martha and the Vandellas' ""Dancing in the Street"" as a fundraising single, which went to number one in the UK and number seven in the US; its video premiered during Live Aid.

Bowie took an acting role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners, and his title song rose to number two in the UK charts. He also worked with composer Trevor Jones and wrote five original songs for the 1986 film Labyrinth, which he starred in. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead combining pop rock with a harder rock sound. Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits ""Day-In Day-Out"", ""Time Will Crawl"" and ""Never Let Me Down"". Bowie later described it as his ""nadir"", calling it ""an awful album"". He supported the album on the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour. The backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although in later years critics acknowledged the tour's strengths and influence on concert tours by other artists, such as Prince, Madonna and U2.

1989–1991: Tin Machine
Wanting to completely rejuvenate himself following the critical failures of Tonight and Never Let Me Down, Bowie placed his solo career on hold after meeting guitarist Reeves Gabrels and formed the hard rock quartet Tin Machine. The line-up was completed by bassist and drummer Tony and Hunt Sales, who had played with Bowie on Iggy Pop's Lust for Life in 1977. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's 1989 self-titled debut album received mixed reviews and, according to author Paul Trynka, was quickly dismissed as ""pompous, dogmatic and dull"". EMI complained of ""lyrics that preach"" as well as ""repetitive tunes"" and ""minimalist or no production"". It reached number three in the UK and was supported by a twelve-date tour.
The tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but recording halted while Bowie conducted the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, which brought him commercial success and acclaim.

In October 1990, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. He recalled, ""I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate."" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. Tin Machine II (1991) was Bowie's first album to miss the UK top 20 in nearly twenty years, and was controversial for its cover art. Depicting four ancient nude Kouroi statues, the new record label, Victory, deemed the cover ""a show of wrong, obscene images"" and airbrushed the statues' genitalia for the American release. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby (1992) failed commercially, Bowie dissolved the band and resumed his solo career. He continued to collaborate with Gabrels for the rest of the 1990s.

1992–1998: Electronic period
On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing ""'Heroes'"" and ""All the Young Dudes"", he was joined on ""Under Pressure"" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium. Four days later, Bowie and Iman married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.
In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz and hip-hop influenced Black Tie White Noise. Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, topping the UK chart and spawning three top 40 hits, including the top 10 single ""Jump They Say"". Bowie explored new directions on The Buddha of Suburbia (1993), which began as a soundtrack album for the BBC television adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's novel of the same name before turning into a full album; only the title track was used in the programme. Referencing his 1970s works with pop, jazz, ambient and experimental material, it received a low-key release, had almost no promotion and flopped commercially, reaching number 87 in the UK. Nevertheless, it later received critical praise as Bowie's ""lost great album"".

Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial Outside (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success and yielded three top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reactions from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, Robert Smith of the Cure, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Black Francis of the Pixies, and Sonic Youth.
Incorporating experiments in jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album—""Little Wonder"" and ""Dead Man Walking""—became UK top 40 hits. The song ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100. Bowie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 February 1997. The Earthling Tour took place in Europe and North America between June and November. In November, Bowie performed on the BBC's Children in Need charity single ""Perfect Day"", which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record ""(Safe in This) Sky Life"" for The Rugrats Movie. Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as ""Safe"" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single ""Everyone Says 'Hi'"". The reunion led to other collaborations with his old producer, including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track ""Without You I'm Nothing"" with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.

1999–2012: Neoclassicist era
Bowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album Hours featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his ""Cyber Song Contest"" Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica. Hours and a performance on VH1 Storytellers in mid-1999 represented the end of Gabrels' association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter. Sessions for Toy, a planned collection of remakes of tracks from Bowie's 1960s period, commenced in 2000, but was shelved due to EMI/Virgin's lack of faith in its commercial appeal. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.
On 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England, playing almost 30 years after his first. The performance was released as a live album in November 2018. On 27 June, he performed a concert at the BBC Radio Theatre in London, which was released on the compilation album Bowie at the Beeb; this also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972. Bowie and Iman's daughter, Alexandra, was born on 15 August. His interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at the February 2001 and February 2003 concerts to support Tibet House US at Carnegie Hall in New York.

In October 2001, Bowie opened the Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"", followed by a full band performance of ""'Heroes'"". 2002 saw the release of Heathen, and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual Meltdown festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television and the Dandy Warhols. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's Low era. Reality (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13 June, Bowie headlined the last night of the Isle of Wight Festival 2004. On 25 June, he experienced chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg. The remaining fourteen dates of the tour were cancelled.
In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song ""Changes"" with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film Shrek 2. During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song ""(She Can) Do That"", co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film Stealth. He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon. He contributed backing vocals on TV on the Radio's song ""Province"" for their album Return to Cookie Mountain, and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir's 2005 album No Balance Palace.

Bowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006. In April, he announced, ""I'm taking a year off—no touring, no albums."" He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour's 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released. He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a benefit event for Keep a Child Alive at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. The performance marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.
Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival. The musicians and artists he selected for the Manhattan event included electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay My Head. In June 2008, a live album was released of a Ziggy Stardust-era concert from 1972. On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 Moon landing—and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with ""Space Oddity""—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix. A live album from the A Reality Tour was released in January 2010.
In late March 2011, Toy, Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for Heathen and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.

2013–2016: Final years
On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new studio album—his first in a decade—to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release in March; the announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of the single ""Where Are We Now?"". A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler. The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six, his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since ""Jump They Say"" in 1993).  A second single and video, ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"", were released at the end of February. Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple.
Recorded in secret between 2011 and 2012, 29 songs were recorded during the album's sessions, of which 22 saw official release in 2013, including fourteen on the standard album. Three bonus tracks were later packaged with seven outtakes and remixes on The Next Day Extra, released in November. On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes. Debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, The Next Day was his first album to top the chart since Black Tie White Noise, and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song ""The Next Day"" created some controversy due to its Christian themes and messages, initially being removed from YouTube for terms-of-service violation, then restored with a warning recommending viewing only by those 18 or over.
According to The Times, Bowie ruled out ever giving an interview again. Later in 2013, he was featured in a cameo vocal in the Arcade Fire song ""Reflektor"". A poll carried out by BBC History Magazine in October 2013 named Bowie as the best-dressed Briton in history. In mid-2014, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer, which he kept private. A new compilation album, Nothing Has Changed, was released in November. The album featured rare tracks and old material from his catalogue in addition to a new song, ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)"".
Bowie continued working throughout 2015, secretly recording his final album Blackstar in New York between January and May. In August, it was announced that he was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon series; the final production included a retooled version of ""No Control"" from Outside. He also wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for Blackstar. On 7 December, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York; he made his final public appearance at its opening night.
Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. He died two days later, after which Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a ""parting gift"" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album ""reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality"". Visconti also said that he had been planning a follow-up album, and had written and recorded demos of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting he believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. Blackstar also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the US Billboard 200.

Posthumous releases
In September 2016, a box set Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) was released covering Bowie's mid-1970s soul period; it included The Gouster, a previously unreleased 1974 album. An EP, No Plan, was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday. Apart from ""Lazarus"", the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the Blackstar sessions, but were left off the album and appeared on the soundtrack album for the Lazarus musical in October 2016. A music video for the title track was also released. 2017 and 2018 also saw the release of a series of posthumous live albums, Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74), Live Nassau Coliseum '76 and Welcome to the Blackout (Live London '78). In the two years following his death, Bowie sold five million records in the UK alone. In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake.
At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017, Bowie won all five nominated awards: Best Rock Performance; Best Alternative Music Album; Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Recording Package; and Best Rock Song. They were Bowie's first Grammy wins in musical categories. On 8 January 2020, on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday, a previously unreleased version of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" was released and two releases were announced: a streaming-only EP, Is It Any Wonder?, and an album, ChangesNowBowie, released in November 2020 for Record Store Day. In August, another series of live shows were released, including sets from Dallas in 1995 and Paris in 1999. These and other shows, part of a series of live concerts spanning his tours from 1995 to 1999, was released in late 2020 and early 2021 as part of the box set Brilliant Live Adventures. In September 2021, Bowie's estate signed a distribution deal with Warner Music Group, beginning in 2023, covering Bowie's recordings from 2000 through 2016. Bowie's album Toy, recorded in 2000, was released on what would have been Bowie's 75th birthday. On 3 January 2022, Variety reported that Bowie's estate had sold his publishing catalogue to Warner Chappell Music, ""for a price upwards of $250 million"".

Acting career
In addition to music, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions. His acting career was ""productively selective"", largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts; he once described his film career as ""splashing in the kids' pool"". He mostly chose projects with arthouse directors that he felt were outside the Hollywood mainstream, commenting in 2000: ""One cameo for Scorsese to me brings so much more satisfaction than, say, a James Bond."" Critics have believed that, had he not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor. Others have felt that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as Lost Highway, A Knight's Tale, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Inglourious Basterds.

1960s and 1970s
Bowie's acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician. His first film was a short fourteen-minute black-and-white film called The Image, shot in September 1967. Concerning a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him, Bowie later called the film ""awful"". From December 1967 to March 1968, Bowie acted in mime Lindsay Kemp's theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise, during which he performed several songs from his self-titled debut album. The production was later adapted into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders. In late January 1968, Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series Theatre 625 that aired in May. He also appeared as a walk-on extra in the 1969 film adaptation of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers.
Bowie's first major film role was in Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which he portrayed Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet. The actor's severe cocaine addiction at the time left him in such a fragile state of mind that he barely understood the film; he later said in 1993: ""My one snapshot of that film is not having to act. Just being me as I was, was perfectly adequate for the role. I wasn't of this earth at that particular time."" Bowie's role was particularly singled out for praise by film critics both on release and in later decades; Pegg argues it stands as Bowie's most significant role. In 1978, Bowie had a starring role in Just a Gigolo, directed by David Hemmings, portraying Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, discovers life has changed and becomes a gigolo employed by a Baroness, playing by Marlene Dietrich. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Bowie expressed disappointment in the finished product.

1980s
From July 1980 to January 1981, Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production The Elephant Man, which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, earning critical praise for his performance. Christiane F., a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, Christiane F. (1981), featured much material from his Berlin albums. The following year, he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play Baal. Bowie made three on-screen appearances in 1983, the first as a vampire in Tony Scott's erotic horror film The Hunger, with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. Bowie later said that he felt ""very uncomfortable"" with the role, but was happy to work with Scott. The second was in Nagisa Ōshima's Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, based on Laurens van der Post's novel The Seed and the Sower, in which he played Major Jack Celliers, a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp. While the film itself received mixed reviews, Bowie's performance was praised. Pegg places it among his finest acting performances. Bowie's third role in 1983 was a small cameo in Mel Damski's pirate comedy Yellowbeard, heralded by several members of the Monty Python group. Bowie also filmed a 30-second introduction to the animated film The Snowman, based on Raymond Briggs's book of the same name.
In 1985, Bowie had a supporting role as hitman Colin in John Landis's Into the Night. He declined to play the villain Max Zorin in the James Bond film A View to a Kill (1985). Bowie reteamed with Julian Temple for Absolute Beginners, a rock musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes's book of the same name about life in late 1950s London, in a supporting role as ad man Vendice Partners. The same year, Jim Henson's dark musical fantasy Labyrinth cast him as Jareth, the villainous Goblin King. Despite initially performing poorly, the film grew in popularity and became a cult film. Two years later, he played Pontius Pilate in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed biblical epic The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Despite only appearing for a three-minute sequence, Pegg writes that Bowie ""acquits himself well with a thoughtful, unshowy performance.""

1990s
In 1991, Bowie reteamed with Landis for an episode of the HBO sitcom Dream On and played a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in The Linguini Incident. Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated. He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in Basquiat, artist/director Julian Schnabel's 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague. Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi's Spaghetti Western Il Mio West (1998, released as Gunslinger's Revenge in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region. He played the ageing gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth's Everybody Loves Sunshine (1999, released in the US as B.U.S.T.E.D.), and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series The Hunger. Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie's involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film of the same name. In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Sega Dreamcast game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, his only appearance in a video game.

2000s and posthumous notes
In Mr. Rice's Secret (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old boy. Bowie appeared as himself in the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander, judging a ""walk-off"" between rival male models, and in Eric Idle's 2002 mockumentary The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch. In 2005, he filmed a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio. Bowie portrayed a fictionalised version of physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed. In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson's animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant television series Extras. In 2007, he voiced the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film. In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, a ""ruthless venture capitalist."" Bowie's final film appearance was a cameo as himself in the 2009 teen comedy Bandslam.
In a 2017 interview with Consequence of Sound, director Denis Villeneuve revealed his intention to cast Bowie in Blade Runner 2049 as the lead villain, Niander Wallace, but when news broke of Bowie's death in January of the same year, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar ""rock star"" qualities. He eventually cast actor and singer Jared Leto. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: ""Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced Blade Runner in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the Blade Runner spirit."" David Lynch also hoped to have Bowie reprise his Fire Walk With Me character for Twin Peaks: The Return but Bowie's illness prevented this. His character was portrayed via archival footage. At Bowie's request, Lynch overdubbed Bowie's original dialogue with a different actor's voice, as Bowie was unhappy with his Cajun accent in the original film.

Other works
Painter and art collector
Bowie was a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills north of Lake Geneva. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased, and he devoted more time to his painting, producing a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of Sandford, ""a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. ... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.""
One of Bowie's paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for $500, and the cover for his 1995 album Outside is a close-up of a self-portrait he painted that year. His first solo show, titled New Afro/Pagan and Work: 1975–1995, was in 1995 at The Gallery in Cork Street, London. In 1997, he founded the publishing company 21 Publishing, whose first title was Blimey! – From Bohemia to Britpop: London Art World from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst by Matthew Collings. A year later, Bowie was invited to join the editorial board of the journal Modern Painters, and participated in the Nat Tate art hoax later that year. The same year, during an interview with Michael Kimmelman for The New York Times, he said ""Art was, seriously, the only thing I'd ever wanted to own."" Subsequently, in a 1999 interview for the BBC, he said ""The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art"". His art collection, which included works by Damien Hirst, Derek Boshier, Frank Auerbach, Henry Moore, and Jean-Michel Basquiat among others, was valued at over £10 million in mid-2016.
After his death, his family decided to sell most of the collection because they ""didn't have the space"" to store it. On 10 and 11 November, three auctions were held at Sotheby's in London. The items on sale represented about 65 per cent of the collection. Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51,470 visitors, the auction itself was attended by 1,750 bidders, with over 1,000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total £32.9 million (app. $41.5 million), while the highest-selling item, Basquiat's graffiti-inspired painting Air Power, sold for £7.09 million.

Writings
Outside of music, Bowie dabbled in several forms of writings during his life. In the late 1990s, Bowie was commissioned for writings of various media, including an essay on Jean-Michel Basquiat for the 2001 anthology book Writers on Artists and forewords to Jo Levin's 2001 publication GQ Cool, Mick Rock's 2001 photography portfolio Blood and Glitter, his wife Iman's 2001 book I Am Iman, Q magazine's 2002 special The 100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Photographs and Jonathan Barnbrook's artwork portfolio Barnbrook Bible: The Graphic Design of Jonathan Barnbrook. He also heavily contributed to the 2002 Genesis Publications memoir of the Ziggy Stardust years, Moonage Daydream, which was rereleased in 2022.
Bowie also wrote liner notes for several albums, including Too Many Fish in the Sea by Robin Clark, the wife of his guitarist Carlos Alomar, Stevie Ray Vaughan's posthumous Live at Montreux 1982 & 1985 (2002), The Spinners' compilation The Chrome Collection (2003), the tenth anniversary reissue of Placebo's debut album (2006) and Neu!'s Vinyl Box (2010). Bowie also wrote an appreciation piece in Rolling Stone for Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and an essay for the booklet accompanying Iggy Pop's A Million in Prizes: The Anthology the same year.

Bowie Bonds
""Bowie Bonds"", the first modern example of celebrity bonds, were asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums that Bowie recorded before 1990. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments. By forfeiting 10 years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by Defries. The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.

Websites
Bowie launched two personal websites during his lifetime. The first, an Internet service provider titled BowieNet, was developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy and launched in September 1998. Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006. The second, www.bowieart.com, allowed fans to view and purchase selected paintings, prints and sculptures from his private collection. The service, which ran from 2000 to 2008, also offered a showcase for young art students, in Bowie's words, ""to show and sell their work without having to go through a dealer. Therefore, they really make the money they deserve for their paintings.""

Musicianship
From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's fascination with music hall continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.
Musicologist James E. Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in ""Space Oddity"", and later in ""'Heroes'"" to dramatic effect; the author writes that ""in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness"". Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as ""particularly deliberate and distinctive"". Authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz call him ""a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect."" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, Bowie's roleplaying is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics ""arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."" In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesisers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (on the ""Heroes"" track ""Moss Garden""); thumb piano; drums (on the Heathen track ""Cactus""), and various percussion instruments.

Personal life
Family
Bowie married his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley, London. Their son Duncan, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie. They had an open marriage and dated other people during it: David had relationships with model Cyrinda Foxe and Young Americans backing singer Ava Cherry; Angie had encounters with Stooges members Ron Asheton and James Williamson, and Ziggy Stardust Tour bodyguard Anton Jones. Angie later described their union as a marriage of convenience. ""We got married so that I could [get a permit to] work. I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing"", she said. Bowie said about Angie that ""living with her is like living with a blow torch."" The couple divorced on 8 February 1980; David received custody of Duncan. After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended, Angie wrote a memoir of their turbulent marriage, titled Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie.
David met Somali-American model Iman in Los Angeles following the Sound+Vision Tour in October 1990. They married in a private ceremony in Lausanne on 24 April 1992. The wedding was solemnised on 6 June in Florence. The couple's marriage influenced the content of Black Tie White Noise, particularly on tracks such as ""The Wedding""/""The Wedding Song"" and ""Miracle Goodnight"". They had one daughter, Alexandria ""Lexi"" Zahra Jones, born on 15 August 2000. The couple resided primarily in New York City and London as well as owning an apartment in Sydney's Elizabeth Bay and Britannia Bay House on the island of Mustique. Following Bowie's death, Iman expressed gratitude that the two were able to maintain separate identities during their marriage.

Other relationships
Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image ""really blossomed"". ""He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."" In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play, The Pistol Shot, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating and moved into a London flat together. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as ""Letter to Hermione"" and ""An Occasional Dream"", reference her; and, for the video accompanying ""Where Are We Now?"", he wore a T-shirt with the words ""m/s Song of Norway"". Bowie blamed himself for their break-up, saying in 2002 that he ""was totally unfaithful and couldn't for the life of me keep it zipped."" Farthingale, who spoke of deep affection for him in an interview with Pegg, said they last saw each other in 1970.
In 1983, Bowie briefly dated New Zealand model Geeling Ng, who had starred in the video for ""China Girl"". While filming The Hunger the same year, Bowie had a sexual relationship with his co-star Susan Sarandon, who stated in 2014 ""He's worth idolising. He's extraordinary."" Between 1987 and 1990, Bowie dated Glass Spider Tour dancer Melissa Hurley. The two began their relationship at the end of the tour when she was only 22 years old. Bowie's Tin Machine collaborator Kevin Armstrong remembered her as ""a genuinely kind, sweet person"". They announced their engagement in May 1989 but never married; Bowie broke the relationship off during the latter half of the Sound+Vision Tour, primarily due to the age difference—he was 43 at the time. He later spoke of Hurley as ""such a wonderful, lovely, vibrant girl"".

Sexuality
Bowie's sexuality has been the subject of debate. While married to Angie, he famously declared himself gay in a 1972 interview with Melody Maker journalist Michael Watts, which generated publicity in both America and Britain; Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries. According to Buckley, ""If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality."" He affirmed his stance in a 1976 interview with Playboy, stating: ""It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."" His claim of bisexuality has been supported by Angie.
In 1983, Bowie told Rolling Stone writer Kurt Loder that his public declaration of bisexuality was ""the biggest mistake I ever made"" and ""I was always a closet heterosexual"". On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings. Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, ""I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people."" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in ""puritanical"" America, ""I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.""
Buckley wrote that Bowie ""mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock."" According to Mary Finnigan—a brief girlfriend of Bowie's in 1969—David and Angie ""created their bisexual fantasy"". Sandford wrote that David ""made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter."" The BBC's Mark Easton stated in 2016 that Britain was ""far more tolerant of difference"", and that gay rights and gender equality would not have ""enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago"".

Spirituality and religion
Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his half-brother, Bowie became interested in Buddhism and, with commercial success eluding him, he considered becoming a Buddhist monk. Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting. After a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by his Lama, Chime Rinpoche, ""You don't want to be Buddhist. ... You should follow music."" By 1975, Bowie admitted, ""I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God."" In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali ""in accordance with the Buddhist rituals"".
After Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992, he said they knew that their ""real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence"". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience. In 1993, Bowie said he had an ""undying"" belief in the ""unquestionable"" existence of God. In a separate 1993 interview, while describing the genesis of the music for his album Black Tie White Noise, he said ""it was important for me to find something [musically] that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion, of which I'm not a believer, I must make that clear."" Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists ""is not a question that can be answered. ... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give me a couple of months. ... I've nearly got it right.'"" He had a tattoo of the Serenity Prayer in Japanese on his left calf.
Bowie stated that ""questioning [his] spiritual life [was] always ... germane"" to his songwriting. The song ""Station to Station"" is ""very much concerned with the Stations of the Cross""; the song also specifically references Kabbalah. Bowie called the album ""extremely dark ... the nearest album to a magick treatise that I've written"". Earthling showed ""the abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism ... What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise."" Hours boasted overtly Christian themes, with its artwork inspired by the Pietà. Blackstar's ""Lazarus"" began with the words, ""Look up here, I'm in Heaven"" while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality.

Political views
As a seventeen-year-old still known as Davy Jones, he was a cofounder and spokesman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men in response to members of the Manish Boys being asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance. He and his bandmates were interviewed on the network's 12 November 1964 instalment of Tonight to champion their cause. He stated on the programme, ""I think we all like long hair and we don't see why other people should persecute us because of it.""
In 1976, speaking as the Thin White Duke persona and ""at least partially tongue-in-cheek"", he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: ""Britain is ready for a fascist leader ... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership."" He was also quoted as saying: ""Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars"" and ""You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up."" Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems, saying: ""I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed."" In the same interview, Bowie described himself as ""apolitical"", stating ""The more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. The more government systems I see, the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people, so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view, or to adopt a party of people and say 'these are my people'.""
In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards anti-racism and anti-fascism. In an interview with MTV anchor Mark Goodman in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of Black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when Goodman suggested that the network's fear of backlash from the American Midwest was one reason for such a lack of coverage. The music videos for ""China Girl"" and ""Let's Dance"" were described by Bowie as a ""very simple, very direct"" statement against racism. The album Tin Machine took a more direct stance against fascism and neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy. In 1993 he released the single ""Black Tie White Noise"" which dealt with the 1992 LA riots. In 2007 Bowie donated 10,000 dollars to the defence fund for the Jena Six saying, ""there is clearly a separate and unequal judicial process going on in the town of Jena"".
At the 2014 Brit Awards, Bowie became the oldest ever recipient of a Brit Award when he won the award for British Male Solo Artist, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss. His speech read: ""I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us."" Bowie's reference to the forthcoming 2014 Scottish independence referendum garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.
In 2016, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said he had wanted to use ""Panic in Detroit"" for his 1998 documentary The Big One. Denied at first, Moore was given the rights after calling Bowie personally, recalling: ""I've read stuff since his death saying that he wasn't that political and he stayed away from politics. But that wasn't the conversation that I had with him.""

Philanthropy
Bowie was involved in philanthropic and charitable efforts for HIV/AIDS research in Africa, as well as other humanitarian projects helping disadvantaged children and developing nations, ending poverty and hunger, promoting human rights, and providing education and health care to children affected by war. A portion of the proceeds from the Pay-per-view showing of Bowie's 50th birthday concert in 1997 was donated to Save the Children.

Death
Bowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment on 10 January 2016. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier, but he had not made his condition public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that he was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.
Tony Visconti wrote:

He always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life – a work of art. He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now, it is appropriate to cry.
Following Bowie's death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows him in his Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. As he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in a Buddhist ceremony in Bali, Indonesia.

Legacy and influence
Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing its immediate forms and subsequent development. Schinder and Schwartz credit Bowie and Marc Bolan as the founders of the glam rock genre. While Bowie inspired the innovators of the punk rock movement, Buckley wrote that in the punk era, ""Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation"". RCA promoted his status during the campaign for ""Heroes"" with the slogan, ""There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie"". His work with Tin Machine, though critically maligned, was later acknowledged as featuring grunge and alternative rock before those styles became popular. He was dubbed the ""chameleon of rock"" due to his constant reinvention.
Perone credited Bowie with having ""brought sophistication to rock music"", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was ""an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions"".
Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was ""an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things"". Peel said he ""liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change""; then Bowie ""subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star"". Buckley called Bowie ""both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.""
Through continual reinvention, his influence broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, ""Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie."" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the ""most influential artist of all time"" in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be ""the most important and influential artist since the Beatles"". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had ""one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century"" and ""he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with"". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for ""the creative powerhouse that Britain has become"" by challenging future generations ""to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks"". Easton concluded that Bowie had ""changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself"". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's Culture Show. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, ""Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie"".
Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture, such as those from the Vatican, namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who quoted ""Space Oddity"", and the German Federal Foreign Office, which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced ""'Heroes'"".
On 7 January 2017, the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary David Bowie: The Last Five Years. A day later, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by close friend and actor Gary Oldman. A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched, and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Tokyo.
On 6 February 2018, the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carried Elon Musk's personal Tesla Roadster and a mannequin affectionately named Starman into space. ""Space Oddity"" and ""Life on Mars?"" were looping on the car's sound system during the launch.

David Bowie Is
An exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called David Bowie Is, was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013. The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops lasting a few months each throughout Europe, Asia and North America before the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over its run.

Stardust biopic
The biopic Stardust was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist. Written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range, the film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971. Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie's music. The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics were generally unfavourable in their reviews.

Moonage Daydream
A film based on Bowie's musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022. Titled Moonage Daydream, after the song of the same name, the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and features never-before-seen footage, performances and music framed by Bowie's own narration. Morgan stated that ""Bowie cannot be defined, he can be experienced... That is why we crafted 'Moonage Daydream' to be a unique cinematic experience."" The documentary is the first posthumous film about Bowie to be approved by his estate. After spending five years in production, the film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the US in IMAX on 16 September. It received positive reviews.

Awards and achievements
Bowie's 1969 commercial breakthrough, ""Space Oddity"", won him an Ivor Novello Special Award For Originality. For his performance in The Man Who Fell to Earth, he won the Saturn Award for Best Actor. In the ensuing decades he received six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards, including Best British Male Artist twice; the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1996; and the Brits Icon award for his ""lasting impact on British culture"", given posthumously in 2016.

In 1999, Bowie was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, and received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated ""I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for.""
During his lifetime, Bowie sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum, eleven gold and eight silver albums, and in the US, five platinum and nine gold. Since 2015, Parlophone has remastered Bowie's catalogue through the ""Era"" box set series, starting with Five Years (1969–1973). Bowie was announced as the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century in 2022.
The 2020 revision of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list includes The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars at number 40, Station to Station at 52, Hunky Dory at 88, Low at 206, and Scary Monsters at 443. On the 2021 revision of the same magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Bowie's songs include ""'Heroes'"" at number 23, ""Life on Mars?"" at 105, ""Space Oddity"" at 189, ""Changes"" at 200, ""Young Americans"" at 204, ""Station to Station"" at 400, and ""Under Pressure"" at 429. Four of his songs are included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was ranked 29. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005. He was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013. Days after Bowie's death, Rolling Stone contributor Rob Sheffield proclaimed him ""the greatest rock star ever"". The magazine also listed him as the 39th greatest songwriter of all time. In 2022, Sky Arts ranked him the most influential artist in Britain of the last 50 years ""owing to his transcendent influence on British culture"". He ranked 32nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Commemoration
In 2008, the spider Heteropoda davidbowie was named in Bowie's honour.
In 2011, his image was chosen by popular vote for the B£10m note of the local currency of his birthplace, the Brixton Pound.
On 5 January 2015, a main-belt asteroid was named 342843 Davidbowie.
On 13 January 2016, Belgian amateur astronomers at MIRA Public Observatory created a ""Bowie asterism"" of seven stars which had been in the vicinity of Mars at the time of Bowie's death; the ""constellation"" forms the lightning bolt on Bowie's face from the cover of his Aladdin Sane album.
In March 2017, Bowie featured on a series of UK postage stamps.
On 25 March 2018, a statue of Bowie was unveiled in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the town where he debuted Ziggy Stardust. The statue features a likeness of Bowie in 2002 accompanied with various characters and looks from over his career, with Ziggy Stardust at the front.
Rue David Bowie in Paris is a short street near the Gare d'Austerlitz.

David Tipper,"David Alexander Tipper, also known as Tipper for short (born c. 1976 in Wimbledon, London, England) is a British composer and producer specialising in electronic music that ranges from ambient, through trip hop, to uptempo nu skool breaks. His live performances consist largely of his own unreleased compositions, and he is noted for scratching his own sounds over his music, creating a live element of turntablism stemming from prowess early in his career as a vinyl DJ.
Tipper is widely respected as a surround sound composer, releasing one of the first albums composed, produced, and intended for the DualDisc format, in addition to providing content for multichannel music industry leaders DTS, Inc. His talents at sound design (his work is included in several of the major music making software programs), and in digital audio mastering, are also in great demand. His catalogue has been consistently licensed for use as background in a variety of mainstream television programmes, and also featured in commercials and cable television projects.

Career
Tipper was ""discovered"" as a teenager DJing in a London nightclub by soon-to-be manager Richie Warren. Their earliest conversations centred on bass frequencies and rhythms underlying beats, and they began researching the science involved in creating the most effective dance music. Richie founded Fuel Records (UK), and Tipper released the first of several vinyl EP's in 1997. Renault licensed one of these, Twister, for a European ad campaign. Soon thereafter, Sony UK signed Tipper to their fledgling dance music label, Higher Ground.

Higher Ground
In the late 1990s, Tipper completed numerous remix projects of his Higher Ground label mates, and released several singles, each highlighting his penchant for electronic dance music with extreme bass frequencies and intricate polyrhythms; this sound helped usher in a popular new music genre referred to as Nu skool breaks, and Tipper is recognised as one of the pioneering producers of this movement. In 1999 Tipper released his first album, The Critical Path. It was not, however, the breakbeat dance record that the label hoped for. Tipper's vision was decidedly more artistic than anticipated, confusing the label as to how to promote it, and disappointing sales led to an amicable parting of ways with Sony.

The Fuel years
During the late 1990s while Tipper was busy in the studio, Richie Warren & Co conceptualised the Fuel Sound System. This consisted of 2 identical black 1970s Dodge Challengers, both fitted with 6 x18"" subwoofers (replacing where the back seats had previously been) and a Funktion-One mid/tops speaker unit, that could be raised out of the trunk on hydraulics with the flick of a switch from the driver's dashboard. These cars were able to run independently, without the need for an electrical generator, using 6 batteries charged via an alternator salvaged out of a lorry. With a totally discreet and fully mobile sound system, the Fuel crew, assuming the role of sonic pranksters, began a ""pilgrimage"" of sound that took them on tour to various music festivals, parties & spontaneous gatherings, setting them up outside events and garnering attention for the label and its artists. One of the urban myths surrounding these appearances recounts the incident at the 1997 V Festival, when Richie Warren received complaints from The Prodigy's stage manager, because the band couldn't hear itself due to the excess volume.
With this activity as a backdrop, Tipper released his second album Holding Pattern in early 2001. Many of the individual tracks from this album found their way into DJ boxes internationally, and accordingly Tipper began touring extensively through Europe, the United States and Australia. Reflecting his travels was the DJ Mix album Sound Off which he completed for Fuel later the same year. Tipper focused on the music, and Richie promoted a lifestyle – taking the cars wherever possible to create a happening around both.

Crunch
Tipper and long time friend Mike Wallis formed Crunch in the late 1990s. The pair released two albums and several EP's together over the following years on labels such as Musik Aus Strom and Mike's own imprint Colony Productions. The Full Moon Gathering 2016 was their first USA performance together in over a decade.

MyUtopia
Under the guise of “Correctional Facilities” he created his first Surround Sound album called “Cell: Five”.Then later while touring across the United States in 2003 with the Fuel cars, Tipper began composing tracks for what would become his first “Tipper” album intended entirely as a surround sound listening experience. Surrounded was released in 2004 by fledgling 5.1 venture MyUtopia Recordings. Eventually nominated as Best Album Intended for Surround Sound this downtempo album also marked a turn in Tipper's musical output away from the nu skool breaks genre which he was more widely associated with. It was during this period that digital music sales and/or reproduction usurped the music industry, and ultimately Fuel Records (UK) met its demise. As Tipper toured and performed his album in 5.1 wherever possible, Richie re-focused his talents towards advanced automobile parts, and Tipper set off on a non-stop touring schedule for two years, with London only a temporary base between tours. Constantly seen living out of his suitcase, and keeping his ""studio"" in his backpack, earned him the temporary moniker The Global Nomad.
Late 2004 saw his Surrounded album re-released as a DualDisc title, and this in turn led to the creation of a MP3 Surround Sound Player, by mp3 rights holders Fraunhofer Society. Regarded as one of the foremost composers in the multichannel realm, Tipper continues to provide content for a number of companies who use his highly detailed productions to demonstrate their own advanced technologies.

Tippermusic
2005 witnessed the establishment of his own imprint Tippermusic, and he embraced the digital music revolution for the freedom it gave musicians to finally determine their own path. No longer constrained by label requirements, Tipper set about releasing his music independently, mostly via online stores. Some investment was made in CDs and vinyl, but ultimately online sales figures showed their declining relevance for his style of output.
Tipper began releasing albums at an accelerated rate. First was the ground breaking Tip Hop, which focused on merging hip hop production with electronic trickery and helped usher in a new genre referred to as glitch hop. He immediately followed up with Relish The Trough, which was material consisting of compositions from his catalogue used primarily for his performances on tour. Both albums found favour in Hollywood, and a number of tracks were used as background in prime-time television shows.
His second full downtempo release The Seamless Unspeakable Something debuted in 2006, with Tipper in full guise as an electronica trip hop artist. Tracks from this album also found favour as background music for TV shows. In 2007, he digitally remastered his old vinyl catalogue and quietly released The Fuel Years and Higher Ground. In early 2008, he made more of his unreleased ""performance catalogue"" available when he released Tertiary Noise, a production which was rumored to be his final foray into the uptempo breakbeat genre that he helped create, and which also used some earlier releases from the likes of The Seamless Unspeakable Something, Relish The Trough, and Holding Pattern as source material for its production.
His 9th studio album, Wobble Factor would be unveiled later in 2008, and solidified Tipper's influence on the burgeoning glitch hop musical movement, especially in the United States.
Shortly after its release, his health demanded his immediate focus, curtailing his studio time and forcing cancellation of all tour dates. While recuperating over time, he laboured on his new ambient/downtempo LP, Broken Soul Jamboree. This album showcased many facets of Tipper's composition and production style, with striking artwork for the album cover and a limited edition poster accompanying the initial CD run.
After Broken Soul Jamboree, Tipper released a series of EPs. These included Snake Eyes, the Bubble Control/Puzzle Dust/Shatter Box trilogy, and an EP of three remixes from that trilogy, ""Dusty Bubble Box"", which was released to raise money for his medical expenses. In 2013, Tipper announced he would only participate in two festival appearances for health reasons. On 6 June, he underwent a successful mitral valve repair surgery. Shortly after his recovery, the full-length album Forward Escape was released in 2014. It took on a darker, more electronically-driven tone than its predecessors, and marked the beginning of a new Tipper sound. He has since released an EP with a similar sound, Fathoms, and a more purely electronic EPs, It's Like..., and ""Lattice"". The most recent full-length album, ""Jettison Mind Hatch"", continues the pattern of downtempo, atmospheric soundscapes that almost enter the realm of ambient.
His notoriety has risen considerably in these years as well, and he is often featured as a headlining act at electronic music festivals spanning the entire continental US, with an extensive showing on the West Coast and occasional East Coast shows. Often, especially when he plays over multiple evenings, Tipper splits his sets into ""uptempo"" and ""downtempo."" His ""uptempo"" sets feature fast tempos and tend toward being a wild dance party. His downtempo sets feature slow to medium tempos and heavy use of melodies. He has also begun to play occasional ambient sets, which generally have limited seating and sell out quickly.
As of 2015, Tipper continues to play concerts a few times a year, and frequently appears at Burning Man.
In April 2016, Tipper headlined his first ever appearance at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA, during Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Gathering. He confirmed after the show that he would return in 2017.
In August 2017, Tipper curated his own Tipper & Friends music festival at the Astral Valley Art Park, 45 minutes south of St. Louis, Missouri.[17] The event was called '4321' and was held to commemorate the 2017 Solar Eclipse. The venue itself is located in the path of direct totality, and attendees were provided custom Tipper-themed safety glasses to view the event.
In January 2018, Tipper curated yet another ""Tipper & Friends"" event, this installment being a ""4 Nights in NOLA"" event (also known as the ""4567"" event) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event took place from 4 to 7 January and featured two historic New Orleans venues: Tipitina's &  the Orpheum Theater. In further homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the event included legendary local acts such as DJ Cochon de Lait and The Madd Wikkid.
Following the conclusion of the ""4567"" event, it was announced that Tipper is expected to present an ""ambient journey"" performance on 20 April at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon. The event is also listed to feature legendary kora players Toumani Diabaté and 
Sidiki Diabaté.
Following the success of 2016's event, April 2019 lead to the historic ""Tipper & Friends - The Full Moon Return"" back in Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida, USA.
In January 2020, Tipperfam assembled for another ""Tipper & Friends"" event with a 3 night run back in NOLA (New Orleans, Louisiana). This event took place from 3 to 5 January, returning to the Orpheum Theater. In continuing to pay homage to New Orleans culture and musical heritage, the theatre was left with a great impression of the community involved, even going as far engaging with the crowd in the spirit of Tipper during the 3rd and final night, as this event was extremely private with very few in attendance. The unofficial after-parties deep within the streets of NOLA continued to further the Tipper-vibes until beyond sunrise. This 3-day event was the 8th, and most recent, installment of the ""Tipper & Friends"" events to date.
In April 2022, Tipper & Friends was again held for another 3 night run, returning to Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida. The 3 day event was held from April 1-3rd and featured LTJ Bukem, Mickman, Schmoop, Humandala, Resonant Language, Detox Unit and Entangled Mind (winner of the submission contest)
In February 2024, Tipper announced his intention to retire in 2025, stating ""I'm very grateful for all the support over the years.""

De Facto (band),"De Facto (alternatively spelt as DeFacto) is an American dub reggae band which has included Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Omar Rodríguez-López, Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens and Jeremy Ward.

Biography
The band began as small jam sessions after At the Drive-In shows. The original band consisted of Rodríguez-López, Bixler-Zavala, and Ward playing local shows around their hometown, El Paso, Texas. Bixler-Zavala said, ""Yeah, actually, we used to be called the Sphinktators, that was early De Facto, just more rock."" Rodríguez-López was the vocalist of the Sphinktators and remembers, ""We used psychedelic sounds, Cedric played the bass, Jeremy played guitar, and Ralph Jasso played drums.""
For their first recording, they brainstormed the name De Facto Cadre Dub, which was later shortened to De Facto. The lineup of the band was switched around: Bixler-Zavala played drums like he did before in his earlier bands Foss and Los Dregtones, Rodríguez-López played bass, and Ward ran samples, sang, and did sparse guitar work. Ralph Jasso moved to keyboards but soon quit the band. The self-titled recording was released as a very limited vinyl pressing in 1999; it would be re-released in 2001 as How Do You Dub? You Fight for Dub. You Plug Dub In., through Headquarter Records, now known as Restart Records. Rodríguez-López met Ikey Owens at a hip hop show. They exchanged numbers, and then Owens met up with them during one of their shows and joined De Facto as their keyboard player midshow. After relocating to the West Coast, Owens joined the band full-time.
Following the break-up of At the Drive-in in 2001, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala switched their focus to working on De Facto. That year eventually saw all the band's releases come out, starting with 456132015 EP produced by Mario Caldato Jr.. De Facto's first full-length album, ¡Megaton Shotblast! was released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label, and received moderate success, likely in part due to the popularity of At the Drive-In. Légende du Scorpion à Quatre Queues, which would be the last De Facto album, followed the same year, released through Modern City Records. Both albums combined the band's studio recordings made in 2000 with live recordings from the European tour in 2001.
In 2001, the members of the band teamed up with bassist Eva Gardner and drummer Blake Fleming to form The Mars Volta. Despite this, De Facto continued to play live shows in the following years. During that time, Rodríguez-López met John Frusciante at one of the shows, and the two became friends; Frusciante once joined De Facto on stage as a guest guitarist. The band, however, did not put out any new material after 2001, and following the death of Jeremy Ward in May 2003 due to drug overdose, any future re-groupings of De Facto appeared highly unlikely.
In a radio interview conducted by Radionica Colombia on October 28, 2008, Cedric Bixler-Zavala revealed that after returning from the South American leg of the current Mars Volta tour, new De Facto material might possibly be recorded.  In the same interview, Bixler-Zavala also stated that he would be returning to the drums for the production. To date, it has not been confirmed if the sessions actually happened.
Since 2001 the only new De Facto release was live footage from a January 3, 2001, show at The Smell, Los Angeles, included on the Gold Standard Laboratories DVD GSL Lab Results Vol. 1 Live in 2007. Rodriguez-Lopez, however, mentioned the possibility of releasing a documentary from the band's European tours, as well as previously unreleased tracks from Mario Caldato Jr. sessions.
Ikey Owens died of a heart attack in 2014, while on tour with Jack White.
In February 2024 it was announced that De Facto would be making a surprise return after more than 20 years to play at the SXSW festival, to coincide with the North American premiere of the documentary Omar and Cedric: If This Ever Gets Weird.

Influences and genres
De Facto's general style was instrumental dub, influenced by the heady sounds of the likes of King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. However, they also dabbled in electronica, Latin and salsa music, and jazz fusion. The band's writing process was largely improvisational, based on an exchange of ideas using drum and bass rhythms as the songs' spines. Many of those ideas later led to what would become the members' next band, The Mars Volta.

Dead Can Dance,"Dead Can Dance are an Australian neoclassical darkwave band from Melbourne. Currently composed of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, the group formed in 1981. They relocated to London the following year. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described Dead Can Dance's style as ""constructed soundscapes of mesmerising grandeur and solemn beauty; African polyrhythms, Gaelic folk, Gregorian chant, Middle Eastern music, mantras, and art rock.""
Having temporarily disbanded in 1998, they reunited in 2005 for a world tour, and again in 2011 to release and tour the album Anastasis. They released their most recent album, Dionysus, in 2018, and toured Europe in 2022.

Career
Formation and early years
Dead Can Dance were formed in Melbourne, Australia, in August 1981 with Paul Erikson on bass guitar, Lisa Gerrard (ex-Microfilm) on vocals and percussion, Simon Monroe (Marching Girls) on drums and Brendan Perry (also of Marching Girls) on vocals and guitar. Gerrard and Perry were a couple who met as members of Melbourne's Little Band scene. Dead Can Dance soon became headliners at Melbourne's main post-punk venue, the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda, and played an Australian farewell show there in May 1982 before moving to London, England, where they signed with alternative music label 4AD. With the duo, the initial United Kingdom line-up were Paul Erikson and Peter Ulrich.
The group's debut album, Dead Can Dance, was released in February 1984. The artwork, which depicts a ritual mask from New Guinea, ""provide[s] a visual reinterpretation of the meaning of the name Dead Can Dance"", set in a faux Greek typeface. The album featured ""drum-driven, ambient guitar music with chanting, singing and howling"", and fit in with the ethereal wave style of label mates Cocteau Twins. They followed with a four-track extended play, Garden of the Arcane Delights in August. AllMusic described their early work as ""as goth as it gets"" (despite the group themselves rejecting the label), while the EP saw them ""plunging into a wider range of music and style"".
For their second album, Spleen and Ideal, the group comprised the core duo of Gerrard and Perry with cello, trombone and tympani added in by session musicians. Released in November 1985, it was co-produced by the duo and John A. Rivers. Raggett describes it as ""a consciously medieval European sound [...] like it was recorded in an immense cathedral"". The group built a following in Europe, and the album reached No. 2 on the UK indie charts. In 1989, Gerrard and Perry separated domestically – Gerrard moved to Barcelona before returning to Australia and Perry moved to Ireland – but still wrote, recorded and performed as Dead Can Dance.

Success
The duo's sixth studio album, Into the Labyrinth, was issued in September 1993 and dispensed with guest musicians entirely; it sold 500,000 copies worldwide and appeared in the Billboard 200. The band became 4AD's highest-selling act. They followed with a world tour in 1994 and recorded a live performance in California which was released as Toward the Within, with video versions on Laserdisc and VHS (later on DVD). Many unofficial bootlegs of concerts spanning its career exist, containing several rare songs that were only performed live. Toward the Within is the duo's first official live album, which reached the Billboard 200 and was followed by In Concert 19 years later. Gerrard released her debut solo recording, The Mirror Pool, and reunited with Perry on the Dead Can Dance studio album Spiritchaser in 1996. The album also charted on Billboard 200 and reached No. 1 on the Top World Music Albums Chart.

Disbandment and reunions
In 1998, Dead Can Dance began recording a follow-up album to Spiritchaser, which was due to be released in early 1999 followed by a planned world tour. However, they separated before it was completed and canceled the tour. One song from the recording sessions, ""The Lotus Eaters"", was eventually released on the box set Dead Can Dance (1981-1998) and on the two-disc compilation Wake (2003). Gerrard teamed with Pieter Bourke (Snog, Soma) to issue Duality in April 1998. Perry released Eye of the Hunter in October 1999.

Dead Can Dance reunited in 2005 and released limited-edition recordings of thirteen shows from its European tour and eight recordings from the subsequent North American tour, as well as a compilation titled Selections from Europe 2005. These concerts were recorded and released on The Show record label. In 2005, the song ""Nierika"" became part of the opening titles for Mexican television station TV Azteca's soap opera La Chacala.
On 12 May 2011, Brendan Perry announced on his official web forum that Dead Can Dance would record a new album and then embark on two-month world tour. The band made a formal announcement about its world tour and new album, Anastasis, for a release date of 13 August 2012.
In late 2011, the band announced a reunion world tour, including 12 US cities, to be accompanied by the release of a live album on a new label. The tour was scheduled to begin on 9 August 2012 in Canada and continue until 19 September 2012 in Turkey, 21 and 23 September in Greece, 13 October in Russia, then 28 October 2012 in Ireland, then Mexico and South America and then in Lebanon and finally Australia in February 2013. On 15 November 2012 it was announced that the band would be returning to Europe to continue its tour, starting on 28 May 2013 in Portugal. The final show of the Anastasis World Tour was in Santiago, Chile, on 13 July 2013. On 17 October 2014, the band announced that plans for an upcoming European tour for Spring 2015 had been cancelled ""due to unforeseen circumstances"".
On 8 September 2015, the band announced the sale of Brendan Perry's Quivvy Church Studio. When asked what this decision meant for the future of Dead Can Dance, Perry responded on the band's official Facebook page that the band has relocated to France and that they are in the process of fabricating a new recording and rehearsal studio.

On 21 April 2018, Perry announced mastering of a new album would be commencing at Abbey Road Studios. The new album, Dionysus, was released on 2 November 2018.
In September 2018, their website announced ""A Celebration – Life & Works 1980-2019"" tour with dates in Europe in May and June 2019. In contrast to previous tours, the setlist drew heavily from the band's older catalogue, featuring some songs the band had never before played live. In October 2019, the band announced a second leg of the tour with dates in North America, Mexico and South America. However, the tour was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 tour as well as rescheduled dates for later in the year were also cancelled citing COVID-19. In March 2022, Perry anticipated plans for a new album influenced by Indian music and new arrangements and rehearsals for an upcoming Tour. A 2022 European tour did take place, and a second European leg was scheduled for the later in the year as well as a North American leg for 2023. However, in September 2022 the band announced the cancellation of both the second European leg as well as the North American dates citing unspecified health reasons.

His ancestry includes German, Swiss, and English heritage. He received his first keyboard for Christmas when he was a teenager. His music career began in the late 1990s, with a chiptune and demoscene movements-influenced sound with the Impulse Tracker. 
Zimmerman graduated from Westlane Secondary School in Niagara Falls. He then worked with an online music licensing company and as a programmer. He adopted the name Deadmau5, which referred to a dead mouse he found in his computer; the unique spelling was a result of a maximum character limitation.

Zimmerman released his debut studio album, titled Get Scraped on July 26, 2005. The tracks ""Just Before 8bit"", ""Nice Try, Kiddo"" and ""Uploading and Downloading"" from Project 56 were edited and expanded upon in Get Scraped under the names ""8bit"", ""Try Again"", and ""Unspecial Effects"", respectively. Tracks ""Bored of Canada"", ""Intelstat"" and ""I Forget"" reappear on this album as is, as well as ""The Oshawa Connection"" from Deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002.
Three self-released compilations, Project 56, Deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002, and A Little Oblique, were finished in 2006, with Project 56 seeing an official release two years later.

In the United States, Zimmerman's collaboration with Kaskade, ""Move for Me"", reached number one on Billboard magazine's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart in its September 6, 2008, issue. Since then, Zimmerman has seen two more tracks, also collaborations (""I Remember"" with Kaskade and ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" with Rob Swire), reach number one on Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, making him the only Canadian to have three number-one tracks on that chart. He is also the sixth Canadian to top that chart, following Deborah Cox, Nelly Furtado, Dragonette, Justin Bieber, and The Weeknd, each with one apiece.
In August 2008 he missed a flight on Spanair Flight 5022, from Barcelona to Gran Canaria, which crashed just after take off. He later discussed the incident on a H3h3Productions podcast in an interview on YouTube.""

MTV named Zimmerman as the house DJ for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and MTV PUSH artist of the week on August 16, 2010. He expressed gratitude towards Lady Gaga and David Guetta for bringing dance into the pop music scene and paving the way for him to the mainstream. At the awards, Zimmerman performed with Jason Derulo and Travie McCoy. His song ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" had been featured on the soundtrack for the MTV reality series Jersey Shore earlier.
His fifth studio album, 4×4=12, was released on December 6, 2010, in the United Kingdom and December 7, 2010, in the United States.

""Some Chords"" was featured on an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation where Zimmerman made a cameo appearance, and an instrumental version of ""Sofi Needs a Ladder"" was featured in the film The Hangover Part II. That year, he also released two non-album singles ""Aural Psynapse"" and ""HR 8938 Cephei"".

2012–2014: Album Title Goes Here and While(1<2)
On August 9, 2012, Zimmerman announced his sixth studio album, Album Title Goes Here, which was released on September 24 of that year. Singles from this album include ""Maths"" on February 17, 2012, ""The Veldt"" (featuring Chris James) on May 8, and ""Professional Griefers"" (featuring Gerard Way) on August 14. Singles ""Channel 42"" (with Wolfgang Gartner) on February 12, 2013, and ""Telemiscommunications"" (with Imogen Heap) on March 12 were released in 2013, after the album was released. His collaboration with Gerard Way on ""Professional Griefers"" was announced on Facebook prior to release. In December 2012, FUSE TV named ""Professional Griefers"" one of the top 40 songs of 2012.
In November 2013, Zimmerman deleted three years' worth of music from his SoundCloud account, replacing them with an EP of seven melancholy piano sonatas, simply called 7, named after the Latin translations for the seven deadly sins: ""Acedia"", ""Avaritia"", ""Gula"", ""Invidia"", ""Ira"", ""Luxuria"", and ""Superbia"". The same month, Zimmerman left longtime label Ultra Records and signed with record label Astralwerks, a famed NYC-based imprint that houses artists such as Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta, and The Chemical Brothers. Speaking on the partnership, Zimmerman admitted, ""I found a place that knows what to do with my music.""
On January 7, 2014, Zimmerman announced via his Twitter account that his much-anticipated new album was complete. ""In other news... I finished my album today,"" the tweet read. ""2 discs. 2 continuous mixes. 25 tracks. and something I'm proud of."" On May 10, 2014, Deadmau5 announced through his subscription service that his upcoming album would be titled While(1<2) and would be released on June 17, 2014. The album was preceded by the release of four singles: ""Avaritia"", ""Seeya"" (featuring Colleen D'Agostino), ""Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer"" and ""Phantoms Can't Hang"". Starting on the week of May 20, 2014, each single was released weekly for a total of four weeks leading up to the release of the album.

2015–2016: Absence, return, and W:/2016Album/
On January 13, 2015, it was announced that Deadmau5 would be a headlining act for the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, in Manchester, Tennessee, which was held on June 11–15, 2015. On February 2, 2015, it was announced he would appear at Reading and Leeds Festivals. On July 23, 2015, Valve announced that Deadmau5 was creating a series of sound clips to be featured in their video game Dota 2. The music pack was released alongside the announcement. On August 8, 2015, Deadmau5 performed live at KeyArena in Seattle at the conclusion of the Dota 2 competition The International 5 (TI5). On October 7, 2015, Deadmau5 officially announced that he was leaving his then label Astralwerks and going entirely independent with his own label Mau5trap.
On December 17, 2015, it appeared that Zimmerman was either taking a leave of absence or ending his career altogether after deleting both his Twitter and his Facebook accounts. His Instagram account, however, had not been deleted. On December 21, 2015, Zimmerman reopened his Twitter account and posted an apology to his Tumblr account explaining his disappearance from social media, saying that he was suffering from depression and would be returning to producing music after the new year.
On May 27, 2016, ""Snowcone"", the first single from Zimmerman in nearly two years, was released as a digital download. This track was later revealed to be the first single from his next album. On November 4, 2016, Zimmerman announced his next studio album, W:/2016Album/, which was released on December 2, 2016, digitally, with vinyl and CD releases on February 17, and March 17, 2017, respectively.

2017–2019: Stuff I Used to Do, Where's the Drop?, Polar soundtrack, and Mau5ville
On January 7, 2017, Zimmerman announced a compilation of his earlier work ranging from the years of 1998 to 2007 on Twitter, titled Stuff I Used to Do. Zimmerman also stated that the compilation would release in February of that year. On February 24, 2017, Zimmerman released a limited version of Stuff I Used to Do on WeTransfer. The edition, available until March 3, featured three tracks less than the full album. The album includes tracks from Get Scraped and early compilations, in addition to an alternative mix of ""Creep"" from While(1<2). The album was officially released on Mau5trap a week later, on March 3, 2017.
On March 25, 2017, Zimmerman began a concert tour with his new ""Cube 2.1"" stage set entitled Lots of Shows in a Row to promote the release of W:/2016Album/. Zimmerman toured around North America for two months, before touring the rest of the world from June 3, 2017, and Canada from October 6, 2017, with the tour concluding on October 31, 2017. On August 25, 2017, Zimmerman released a stand-alone single entitled ""Legendary"", featuring guest vocals from rapper Shotty Horroh. A music video for the song was released on Mau5trap's YouTube channel on September 11, 2017. In September 2017, Zimmerman confirmed his next studio album is ""on the way"".
In March 2018, Zimmerman announced a compilation album comprising orchestral performances of previously released music, titled Where's the Drop?.

In October 2018, the track listing of a follow-up EP, Mau5ville: Level 2, was leaked, showing featured collaborations with Lights and Mr. Bill, with no release date confirmed at the time. The EP was released officially on November 16, 2018, through Mau5trap.
On January 25, 2019, Polar premiered on Netflix, with Zimmerman releasing the soundtrack album, Polar (Music from the Netflix Film), through Mau5trap. On February 1, 2019, the third installment in the Mau5ville series, Mau5ville: Level 3 was released through Mau5trap.

In November 2019, Zimmerman released three new singles, entitled ""SATRN"", ""COASTED"" and ""FALL"", released on the 16th, 22nd and 29th, respectively.

2020–present: Kx5 and upcoming ninth studio album

The concert broke records with a crowd of 50,000 and netted $3.7 million dollars. In January 2023, the release date for the duo's first album, eponymously titled Kx5, was announced for March 17.
Zimmerman was part of the lineup for the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2023.
On March 22, 2024 Zimmerman was honored at the 2024 Electronic Dance Music Awards with the Legend Award. Driven by its fan-based voting system, the EDMA's are held annually at the Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel in Miami.

Video game appearances
Zimmerman is a playable avatar in DJ Hero 2, a video game released in October 2010. The game featured several tracks by the artist, including a mix of ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" with Lady Gaga's ""Just Dance"". He is also featured as a secret unlockable character in the 2014 video game Goat Simulator as ""deadgoa7"". His music has been included in other video game titles, including a custom soundtrack for Dota 2.
In the mobile app Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff by TinyCo, Deadmau5 was available for purchase as a playable character during the ""PeterPalooza"".
Virtual versions of his helmet are also an available accessory as a topper and antenna in Rocket League.
In the 2020 video game Fuser, ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" is featured as a mixable song.
Deadmau5’s Minecraft account has ears that are linked to his username, which cannot normally be created using the game’s “skins.”

Personal life
On July 30, 2010, at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Zimmerman collapsed on stage, suffering from exhaustion and vomiting. This resulted in the cancellation of the rest of the show, as well as nine shows following the event.
In September 2012, Zimmerman began dating American tattoo artist and TV personality Kat Von D. After breaking up in November 2012, they rekindled their relationship shortly afterwards. On December 15, 2012, Zimmerman proposed to Von D via Twitter, and they announced that they would marry in August 2013 with an aquatic-themed wedding. They both have several matching tattoos, including the numbers ""289m3d22h"" on both of their arms, a sentimental reference to the day when they met, as well as two black stars underneath their eyes. Zimmerman moved to Los Angeles to live with Von D. In June 2013, Von D announced that they had ended their engagement.
In 2014, Zimmerman purchased a $5 million home in the Campbellville area of Milton, Ontario.
On August 12, 2017, Zimmerman married Kelly Fedoni. By June, 2021, he and Fedoni had separated and would divorce, but stated that their relationship had ended amicably.
In January 2024, Zimmerman had to cancel a gig due to an upper respiratory infection.

Etymology
Zimmerman's father claims that when his son was in his early teens, he was chatting with a friend on his computer, which then abruptly shut off. According to Zimmerman's father, he said that it had a smell of burnt wire and had a strange odor. Zimmerman started to dismantle his computer and happened to find a dead mouse. Zimmerman then became known as the ""dead mouse guy"" among friends. He tried to change his name to ""Deadmouse"" in an online chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to ""Deadmau5"". ""Maus"" is the German word for ""mouse"" and is pronounced the same as in English; the ending character 5 instead of an 's' is a form of leet.
Zimmerman created the original logo—called ""mau5head""—while learning how to use 3D modelling software. The logo appears in many different colors and designs, and has been shown on the cover art of most of Zimmerman's albums. He was given the idea to wear a helmet based on the logo by one of his friends, Jay Gordon of the industrial metal band Orgy. In an interview with CBC Television, Zimmerman said that he wants his logo to be an ""icon"". Fans often attend Deadmau5 concerts sporting their own copy or alteration of the mau5head.
He created his website and began uploading songs to SectionZ and producing under the alias ""Deadmau5"" in 2002.

Controversies
DirtyCircuit
In 2008, an artist called DirtyCircuit claimed to have been threatened with legal action after using a sample called ""LP_Faxing Berlin C_128bpm"" that came bundled with FL Studio, and to which Zimmerman claimed copyright. The sample was a direct clip of a full bar of the song. Zimmerman provided a ""Demo Track"" which came bundled with FL Studio, along with several loop samples. The case caused slight discomfort among the users of FL Studio, and some have pointed out potential inconsistencies in the EULA of the software. Subsequent versions, after FL Studio 8, no longer contained those loop samples.

Disney trademark dispute
In a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone, Zimmerman acknowledged possible similarities between his Mau5head logo and that of Mickey Mouse, joking that ""someone at the Disney patent office fell asleep on that one.""
In March 2014, it was reported that The Walt Disney Company had filed a request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to investigate Zimmerman's application to register the Mau5head emblem as a trademark, noting its resemblance to the figure of Mickey Mouse. Disney officially filed its opposition in September 2014, arguing that the mark is likely to cause confusion because it is ""nearly identical in appearance, connotation, and overall commercial impression"" to Disney's trademarked iconography of Mickey Mouse. In response to the opposition, Zimmerman spoke out against Disney on Twitter, arguing that the company thinks of people as being ""stupid"" because ""[they] might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse."" Zimmerman also believed that he had been targeted by Disney due to their attempts to ""cash in"" on the EDM market, specifically alluding to Dconstructed—a recently released compilation album containing remixes of music from Disney properties by major electronic musicians such as Armin van Buuren, Avicii and Kaskade.
On September 4, 2014, Zimmerman revealed on Twitter that Disney had used ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" in a Mickey Mouse ""re-micks"" video on their website and YouTube channel without his or his labels' permission, and posted pictures showing a takedown notice that had been sent to Disney by his lawyers. The letter also contained a trademark infringement accusation, arguing that the use of Deadmau5's name in material regarding the video falsely implied his endorsement of it. Disney argued that it had properly licensed the song and that there was ""no merit to his statement.""
In an October 2014 USPTO filing, Zimmerman argued that Disney has attempted to co-exist with him in goodwill. Zimmerman presented evidence that Disney had been in contact with him regarding potential collaborative projects, including an offer to participate in a ""re-imagining"" of Fantasia as a live concert tour for the film's 75th anniversary.
In June 2015, Zimmerman's attorney stated that he and Disney had ""amicably resolved their dispute."" Zimmerman appeared in an episode of the Disney+ series The Muppets Mayhem in 2023.

Meowingtons trademark dispute
In 2015, Zimmerman attempted to register a trademark for the name of his pet cat, Professor Meowingtons, whom he adopted in 2010 and has incorporated into some of his own merchandising. However, the registration was rejected due to a pre-existing Meowingtons trademark held by an online retailer of the same name established in 2014, which sells cat-themed accessories and clothing. After discovering the trademark, Zimmerman petitioned against it, citing his pre-existing uses.
In March 2017, Zimmerman was sued by Emma Bassiri (the owner of the website) for trademark infringement and unfair competition; the suit argued that claims by Zimmerman that she had named the site specifically after the cat was false. Zimmerman himself told The Hollywood Reporter that ""from the very beginning I was working to find a way to resolve this situation amicably"", but that he had been forced to ""litigate this woman out of existence"". On May 15, 2017, Deadmau5 filed a countersuit against Bassiri with the intention of seeking forfeiture of Bassiri's website and domain name.
In March 2018, World Intellectual Property Review reported that Zimmerman and Bassiri had resolved their dispute.
Professor Meowingtons died in 2023, aged 16.

Offensive remarks
In October 2018, Zimmerman posted comments on Twitter during an argument including the statements ""I'll bet you suck a guy off for 40 grand, zero fucking questions asked"" and ""women don't posses [sic] penises"". These comments were construed by readers as being homophobic and transphobic. Zimmerman apologized for his comments, saying that he ""wasn't trying to make blatant transphobic statements"", and had ""just got into a heated arguement  [sic] with some dude online"", noting that his comments had been taken ""somewhere unintended"".
A few days later, during a gaming stream, he referred to a track by fellow electronic artist Slushii as ""AIDS fucking music"" and calling it ""autistic shit"". Slushii – who is on the autism spectrum – responded to these comments on Twitter, calling them ""really disappointing"". Zimmerman later apologized for these comments, citing mental health issues that required ""professional help"", and stating that he would take time ""off the radar"" to ""work on [himself]"".
In February 2019, while playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on a livestream on Twitch, Zimmerman called another player a ""fucking cock-sucking stream sniper fag."" Twitch suspended Zimmerman from their platform for hate speech, after which he posted: ""I know who I am, and I don't have to fucking sit here and cry and defend my fucking self with the obligatory 'I'm not that person, I am sorry' reflex,"" vowing to never work with the company again. Zimmerman later apologized for his remarks in a Reddit post, and was subsequently reinstated.

Deep Forest,"Deep Forest is a French music project that originally began as a duo consisting of Michel Sanchez and Éric Mouquet. They compose a style of world music, sometimes called ethnic electronica, mixing ethnic with electronic sounds and dance beats or chillout beats. Their sound has been described as an ""ethno-introspective ambient world music"".
They were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1994 for Best World Music Album, and in 1995 they won the Award for the album Boheme. The group also became World Music Awards Winner – French group with the highest 1995 world sales. Their albums have sold over 10 million copies. Sanchez started his own career as a singer in 2005, while Mouquet continued working under the band's original name.

History
Michel Sanchez came up with the idea of mixing the native Baka pygmy spoken word with modern music after hearing on-site recordings of these tribes conversing. Along with Eric Mouquet they created the project Deep Forest. Their first self-titled album (nominated for a Grammy) was released in 1992, with ""Sweet Lullaby"" being the smash single which would put Deep Forest on the musical map (UK Top 10 hit). The song ""Sweet Lullaby"" is adapted from a traditional song from the Solomon Islands. A lullaby named ""Rorogwela"", sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita woman, was used as a vocal sample in the ""Sweet Lullaby"". The album Deep Forest was dance-driven and the samples were heavily digitised and edited. It was re-released as a limited edition in 1994 under the name World Mix. ""Sweet Lullaby"" also uses Baka water drumming in the background. 

For their second album Boheme, Eric and Michel left behind the sounds of the forest and ventured into Eastern Europe bringing tender, lonesome Hungarian and Roma chants with upbeat, yet sad, music. Due to this shift, Dan Lacksman (from Telex, producer and sound-engineer of the first album) decided to go his separate way and continued working on other projects like Pangea. The chants were no longer brief, instead extended phrases had been sampled from Hungarian, and Russian. Hungarian singer Márta Sebestyén and Bulgarian Kate Petrova performed on this album. 
The duo also performed and produced the remixes for the Youssou N'Dour single ""Undecided"" in 1994, with guest vocals by Neneh Cherry (who featured on n'Dour's break-through single ""Seven Seconds""). That same year Deep Forest made remixes for Jon Anderson's ""Deseo"", Apollo 440's ""Liquid Cool"" and Cesária Évora's ""My Fatigue is Endless"". In 1996 Deep Forest collaborated with Peter Gabriel on the song ""While the Earth Sleeps"" which was written for the film Strange Days.
The follow-up third album, Comparsa, contained Spanish chants and sounds. The music is often upbeat and celebratory. The last song from the album, Media Luna, which was also released as a single, features a duet of Syrian and Spanish singers Abed Azrei and Ana Torroja.The duo collaborated with Joe Zawinul on the song Deep Weather during the recording of the album.
Also Jorge Reyes (late Mexican musician), collaborated in this album with percussion, vocals and the flute.
A recording of their live concert in Japan was also released on a CD called Made in Japan. Although all the songs featured in the show are from the previous three albums, they have new often-longer arrangements and all the chants are performed and reinterpreted by live performers.
In 1999 Deep Forest worked with Cheb Mami and Catherine Lara on the song ""L'Enfant Fleur"" which had been composed for Sol En Si (a French charity which helps HIV families).
In 2000, Deep Forest released their fourth album, Pacifique. This album was composed to support the movie ""Le prince du Pacifique"" It mixes Pacific and island beats with electronic music.
Music Detected was the title of their fifth much-anticipated official Deep Forest album which saw the duo turn its attention to the Far East and the Orient for inspiration. It also signalled a change in musical style for Deep Forest, from dance to a more rock-influence. They collaborated with Indonesian pop musician Anggun on the bilingual song Deep Blue Sea which served as the lead single.
In 2003 Deep Forest released a compilation album Essence of the Forest, with some remastered tracks.
In 2004 Deep Forest collaborated with Josh Groban, he composed and produced 2 songs on the album Closer.
In 2006 Deep Forest collaborated with Josh Groban on the album Awake. 
In 2008 Deep Forest released the album Deep Brasil, a collaboration with Brazilian artist Flavio Dell Isola.
During 2009-2010 Deep Forest went with a new band formula on stage and Deep Forest performed in different countries and continents (China, Africa, the United States, Japan, France...).
In 2014  Deep Forest Released the Album  ""Deep Africa""
In 2013 Sony music India released Deep India, a Deep Forest and Rahul Sharma collaboration.
In 2017, the band collaborated with Ukrainian folk project Onuka on the song ""VSESVIT"". The track is part of Onuka's second studio album ""MOZAїKA""

Music for films
In 1994, Deep Forest appeared on the soundtrack for Robert Altman's Prêt-à-Porter with the song ""Martha"".
Deep Forest was hired to provide a full original score for the 1995 movie Strange Days and their credit appears on early advertising for the film. In the end, the score was instead composed by Graeme Revell. One cue from Deep Forest's original music remains in the film, titled ""Coral Lounge"". Deep Forest also teamed with Peter Gabriel to write an original song, ""While the Earth Sleeps"", for the film's end credits. In addition, two tracks from Deep Forest's album ""Boheme"" were featured in the film - ""Anasthasia"" and ""Bohemian Ballet. The two new Deep Forest tracks, ""Coral Lounge"" and ""While the Earth Sleeps"", were included on the film's soundtrack album. The version of ""While the Earth Sleeps"" on the album is an edited version. The complete film version was released by Columbia as a CD single in Austria and Japan.
One of Deep Forest's songs, ""Night Bird"", was used in the 1996 film version of The Island of Dr. Moreau.
In December 2000, Deep Forest composed a soundtrack for the French film Le Prince du Pacifique. The album, entitled Pacifique, is a return to a more ambient and melancholy sound, with piano themes riding above moody synth textures, Pacific Island chants, scratchy synth-leads and electronic drumming.
In 2004 the duo composed a soundtrack for the Japanese film Kusa No Ran. A remix of ""Sweet Lullaby"" was also used for Matt Harding's viral hit ""Where the Hell is Matt?""

Side projects
Both Sanchez and Mouquet have worked over a variety of side-projects and solo albums. Sanchez has two solo albums out and produced Wes successful debut album; while Mouquet created the group Dao Dezi, collaborated with Catherine Lara and arranged Thorgal, he composed and produced songs for Ana Torroja (Mecano), Jean Sebastien Lavoie, and composed and produced songs for Josh Groban.

Live performances
Deep Forest had their first live concert in 1996 at the G7 Summit in Lyon, France. They continued from there on to the Deep Forest '96 world tour. During the 1996 tour, Deep Forest performed a number of shows in France, Hungary, Greece, Australia, Japan, Poland and US. After the completion of Comparsa there was a '98 world tour. Since '98 there have been numerous live performances, including the Image Concerts, which took place in Japan. The concerts were based around the 'Image' album (similar to Pure Moods) and featured a number of famous Japanese artists, also including Deep Forest.

Donations
A percentage of proceeds from Deep Forest's debut album sales went to the Pygmy Fund, set up to aid the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Efe pygmies in the transition from nomadic to agrarian subsistence, and to provide appropriate health care. However, music of the Efe people was not included on the record, and so the musicians sampled on the record would not have benefited.
A portion of the proceeds from 'Boheme' go to the György Martin Foundation, which aids in protecting the Roma culture of Hungary.
Deep Forest also actively supports the Sana Madagascar Association starting with 'Comparsa'. ""The aim of the Sana Madagascar Association is to contribute protecting the environment, to collect instruments and precious recordings in order to allow the Malagasy man to save his culture, his nature and his traditional music.""

Controversy
The song ""Freedom Cry"" from the album Boheme caused controversy when it was revealed that the Hungarian Roma singer, Károly Rostás (""Huttyán""), never received any monetary compensation from the song, and neither did his family after he died in 1986. His singing, archived by Claude Flagel, was sampled by Deep Forest. Flagel allegedly paid Huttyán 1500 forints for the recording. The case was later documented in a movie entitled Huttyán, released in 1996.
The relatives did succeed to some extent in getting compensation from Deep Forest.
Deep Forest's signature song ""Sweet Lullaby"" centres on an uncredited recording of ancestral Baegu lullaby ""Rorogwela"", from Malaita, sung by a woman named Afunakwa, and recorded by ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp. The recording was used without authorization from Afunakwa, Zemp, label UNESCO discs or distributor Auvidis, although Zemp had earlier reluctantly given oral permission for an unrelated recording to be used. The Deep Forest project has since become a cause celèbre as an example of primitivist caricature and cultural appropriation.

Influences
Mouquet was influenced by his interests in house and techno music.

Deerhunter,"Deerhunter is an American indie rock band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 2001. The band currently consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Moses Archuleta (drums, electronics, sound treatments), Lockett Pundt (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Josh McKay (bass) and Javier Morales (keyboards, synthesizers, alto saxophone).
Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died on March 29, 2004, of head injuries suffered during a skateboarding accident. He was 24 years old. The band recorded their first studio album, Turn It Up Faggot (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as a song-writing partner, second guitarist, and occasional lead vocalist.
Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, Cryptograms (2007), combined ambient work and more angular garage rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, Fluorescent Grey. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, Microcastle and Weird Era Cont., in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.
Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen and engineer David Barbe the band's fourth studio album, Halcyon Digest (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim, ranked as Pitchfork's 29th and Stereogum's 78th best album of the decade. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the primitivist garage rock and musique concrète-influenced Monomania (2013). The album expanded on a darker and more disturbing sound, complete with treated tape recordings of rats and insects, exploring themes of disassociation and mental illness.
The following year, Cox was struck by a vehicle while walking his dog near his home in Atlanta's Grant Park. During his recovery and rehabilitation he focused on writing songs resulting in the album Fading Frontier (2015).
Deerhunter have described themselves as ""ambient punk,"" though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including noise, garage rock, art rock, as well as significant pop elements.

History
2001–2005: Formation and Turn It Up Faggot
The band was co-founded in 2001 by vocalist Bradford Cox and drummer and keyboardist Moses Archuleta. The name Deerhunter (which Cox has repeatedly remarked upon despising) was chosen by the band's first drummer, Dan Walton. Cox did not care then what the band was called as he thought it to be just another temporary art project. The band was joined by Colin Mee, whom Cox met while Mee was living at the Atlanta label Die Slaughterhaus Records with members of Black Lips. The two bonded over a shared interest in Dada and 20th Century Composers Olivier Messiaen and György Ligeti, as well as British bands The Fall, The Raincoats, and Cabaret Voltaire. In 2004 the group's second bassist, Justin Bosworth, died of head injuries suffered in a skateboarding accident at age 24. He appeared on only one Deerhunter release, the Deerhunter/Alphabets Split, issued before their debut album. Joshua Fauver, of Atlanta punk band Electrosleep International, then took up the position as bassist. Deerhunter's first album, Turn It Up Faggot, was ""the result of a lot of negativity"". After the band finished the album, in an indication of how difficult it was to record in the wake of his bandmate's death, Cox said ""I don't ever want to make this album again"". The album's liner notes are dedicated to Bosworth. After the release of Turn It Up Faggot, Cox asked his best friend from high school, Lockett Pundt, to join the band.

2005–2007: Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey EP
The band, now featuring Pundt's reverb-saturated guitar sound, went on tour, playing shows with the likes of Lightning Bolt and Gang Gang Dance. This tour culminated in a recording session engineered by acclaimed folk musician Samara Lubelski at Rare Book Room, New York City. This session failed to produce anything that could be used, due to Cox's mental and physical state at the time, as well as technical disagreements that emerged with Lubelski. Cox has kept a copy of the sessions on ""a scratched CD-R under my bed"" and has stated that ""nobody will ever hear them"". In spite of Cox's claim excerpts from those sessions were later posted as a free download on the band's blog. The band returned to the same studio where they recorded their first album outside Athens, Georgia and decided to give recording their second album another attempt. This was partly due to advice received from the band Liars, who encouraged them to re-record it.
It took only two days in November 2005 for the band to record their second album, entitled Cryptograms. In 2006, before its release, Pitchfork Media added ""Spring Hall Convert"", a song from the record, to its ""Infinite Mix Tape series"". The album was released by Kranky in January 2007. The album revealed a more subdued and introverted sound for the band. As with their first album, Cryptograms also had a dedication inside the album's liner notes, this time to a friend of Cox's, Bradley Ira Harris, a heroin addict who died in 2005.
On May 8, 2007, the group released the Fluorescent Grey EP, which was recorded in July 2006. The EP featured more use of rudimentary keyboards, bells, and pianos.
On August 29, 2007, the group became a quartet with the loss of guitarist Colin Mee. Mee departed because he ""...couldn't make it to a couple of shows we had booked next weekend and that was unacceptable to certain bandmates"". Mee rejoined the band four months later, but departed the band for the final time before 2008.

2007–2009: Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. and Rainwater Cassette Exchange EP
Deerhunter contributed the song ""After Class"" to Living Bridge, a compilation put together by Rare Book Room Records. The song was recorded in the same place where they attempted to record their second album. They returned to Rare Book Room studios in April 2008 to record ""Oh, It's Such A Shame,"" a Jay Reatard cover that would be released as a split single with Reatard himself covering the Fluorescent Grey title track. In the same month they recorded their next album, Microcastle. Prior to the announced release date for the LP, the band continued to tour, with one date opening for The Smashing Pumpkins and a select of fall shows opening for Nine Inch Nails.
The quartet's third offering, Microcastle, was set to be released on October 27, 2008, although it became available through peer-to peer networks in late May. In an attempt to reward fans who awaited for the street date, the group reconvened to record a new album of material, Weird Era Cont., which later leaked before its street date also. However, Microcastle did manage to debut at No. 123 on the Billboard 200, a first for Deerhunter. Mee left the band again, for the final time, and the band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.
While touring the Microcastle album in the UK, Cox booked an evening in a studio and recorded what would become the On Platts Eyott cassette. This was released in two batches of 100 copies each; an edition of pink cassettes was given out to competition winners by his record label and orange cassettes were sold at a special Halloween concert in Atlanta on October 31, 2008. In a comment left on the Deerhunter blog on February 28, Cox announced that Whitney Petty was no longer a member of the band, stating:

We will be a four-piece again for now. Whitney is what you would call a 'free spirit.' She's also a great friend. Deerhunter is the four of us. We might have people come and go and that's just how we keep things interesting for ourselves.
While on tour, the band managed to release Rainwater Cassette Exchange, an EP of songs written during the Microcastle sessions, and ""Vox Celeste 5,"" a Sub Pop single of songs from Weird Era Cont. and Microcastle. To promote the releases, they embarked on a short summer trek with No Age and Dan Deacon as the ""No Deachunter Tour."" Later during a performance at All Tomorrow's Parties 2009 Music Festival in September (curated by The Flaming Lips), Bradford Cox announced that the band will be going on hiatus to ""devote time to some other things,"" calling the show their last ""for a long time."" During the hiatus, Bradford Cox continued with Atlas Sound and released his second album Logos, Josh Fauver resumed work with his record label Army of Bad Luck, Moses Archuleta enrolled in culinary school, and Lockett Pundt performed some shows in celebration of The Floodlight Collective, his debut album as Lotus Plaza released in March of that year.

2010–2012: Halcyon Digest
In early January, it was revealed that the group would serve as openers on the upcoming Spoon tour to promote their album Transference. Along with the Spoon tour, the group also announced some shows of their own, including stops at the 2010 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and All Tomorrow's Parties (curated by Simpsons creator, Matt Groening.) During these shows, the band began to debut some new material, including the songs ""Helicopter"", ""Primitive 3D"", ""Fountain Stairs"" and ""Revival"", all of which would end up being recorded for their next studio session to follow.
In June, Deerhunter took a short break from touring to record Halcyon Digest. Initial news of the album became public when music industry firm, Milk Money, posted a message on their Twitter account that the band had been mixing the new record with Ben Allen (who also worked on Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion and Fall Be Kind EP.) A week later the band launched a new website, where they announced the title and release date of the LP, along with a guerilla style marketing campaign. The first single, ""Revival,"" was made available to fans who had assisted the band with promotion for the new album through a link via official email. In the same month, director John Albrecht posted a trailer for an upcoming live video on his Vimeo page set to be released later in the year.
In 2012, it was announced that Deerhunter was to provide an original score to The Curve of Forgotten Things, a short film by the fashion line Rodarte starring Elle Fanning. That same year, bassist Josh Fauver left the band via email in 2012, just prior to the recording of Monomania.

2013–2014: Monomania
On March 22, 2013, Deerhunter announced their sixth studio album would be released on May 7, 2013. The album, entitled Monomania, was recorded in New York with frequent collaborator and producer Nicolas Vernhes at his Rare Book Room Studio, where Microcastle and Parallax were taped. For Monomania, Josh McKay took over bass duties, and Atlanta native Frankie Broyles was brought in to play guitar. Deerhunter's press release described the record as ""nocturnal garage"" while having an avant garde context. On April 2, 2013, the band performed the song ""Monomania"" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
Deerhunter headlined and curated the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival held at Pontins holiday camp in Camber Sands, England from the June 21–23, 2013. At the event they performed the Cryptograms, Microcastle & Halcyon Digest albums in full, with Atlas Sound also performing. Deerhunter was announced as a headliner at Austin Psych Fest, the 6th annual festival held April 26–28, 2013, Heineken Primavera Sound (Barcelona), Optimus Primavera Sound (Porto), and perform live at Dancity Festival (Foligno, Italy) along with FYF Fest in Los Angeles during 2015. Deerhunter have also been asked to play at the Meredith Music Festival this December in Victoria, Australia.
On December 4, 2014, frontman Bradford Cox was seriously injured and hospitalized after being hit by a car in Atlanta, GA.

2015–2017: Fading Frontier
On August 16, 2015, Deerhunter released a video for a new song titled ""Snakeskin,"" and announced that their new album, Fading Frontier, was released on October 16, 2015, on the 4AD label. The song featured alto saxophonist Zumi Rosow and the video was directed by Valentina Tapia. On October 13, Deerhunter shared the video for 'Living My Life', dedicated to Miles Davis. The LP was very well received by critics.

2018–present: Double Dream of Spring and Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?
In 2018, the band released a cassette-only studio album during their Spring 2018 tour called Double Dream of Spring. A mostly instrumental album, it was made to fill the void until their next album would be released the following year.
Former bass guitarist Joshua Fauver died in November 2018 at age 39. He was a member of the band from 2004 to 2012.
Deerhunter's eighth album Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared? was released on January 18, 2019. The album's first single, ""Death in Midsummer"", was released in October 2018 co-produced by Cate Le Bon.
On Halloween 2019, Deerhunter released the 13-minute long single ""Timebends"". A separate entity to their eighth studio album, Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared?, ""Timebends"" is a partly-improvised stream-of-consciousness outpouring, recorded live direct to tape and in one take with minimal overdubs and mastered using a completely analog signal chain.
The next day, Cox released the Myths 004 EP in collaboration with Cate Le Bon, recorded in Marfa, Texas as part of an ongoing series with Dev Hynes, Ariel Pink and Connan Mockasin.
The band subsequently spent November 2019 on tour around Europe.

Musical style and influence
The band has revealed many artists and genres that contribute to Deerhunter's sound. The New York Times concert review mentioned ""the Breeders, Stereolab, disco rhythm, krautrock, Sonic Youth’s noise breakdowns, girl-group pop, the picked eighth-note bass lines of 1980s indie rock"", as influences. The song ""Coronado"" from Halcyon Digest features saxophone sounds inspired by the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St. Cox recalled, ""I wanted that sax on there because I was listening to the Stones' Exile on Main St reissue a lot...I began to see a pattern forming. Saxophones are becoming this thing. That's why we did it early. Next year everyone's gonna have a saxophone on their record because saxophones are just cool.""
Deerhunter has been described as indie rock, experimental rock, psychedelic pop, noise rock, garage rock and art rock.

Touring
During live shows, Cox has worn sundresses and has performed with fake blood smeared over his face and hands, their live show being ""much more savage"" than their albums. In his explanation of the sundresses Cox has said, ""I don't like the idea of going around stage in just jeans and a t-shirt. It seems anticlimactic.""
Deerhunter have supported many bands on tour, including Nine Inch Nails, TV on the Radio, Project Pat, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Spoon, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Fiery Furnaces, Lower Dens, Ex Models, Battles, and Kings of Leon.

Delerium,"Delerium is a Canadian new-age ambient electronic musical duo that formed in 1987, originally as a side project of the influential industrial music act Front Line Assembly. Throughout the band’s history, their musical style has encompassed a broad range, including dark ethereal ambient trance, voiceless industrial soundscapes, and electronic pop music. They are best known for their worldwide hit ""Silence"". The band is known to feature female guest vocalists on their albums since their 1994 album Semantic Spaces.

Members and history
Delerium has traditionally been a two-person project, but the only constant member throughout its history has been Bill Leeb. Leeb was an early member of industrial music pioneers Skinny Puppy, but after he left in 1986 he went on to create his own project, Front Line Assembly, with collaborator Michael Balch. Later, the two worked on the side project Delerium and released their first album, Faces, Forms & Illusions. After Balch left both Front Line Assembly and Delerium, Leeb worked with Rhys Fulber, and the two released several albums under the Delerium moniker; these years saw a gradual stylistic change from darker ambient to a more danceable sound. After the release of Karma, Fulber left to pursue other interests, and Leeb teamed up with producer Chris Peterson to release Poem. 2003, however, saw the reunion of Leeb and Fulber for the release of Chimera, followed by Nuages du Monde in 2006.
In contrast to Leeb and collaborators' other projects, Delerium has included several guest vocalists since the release of Semantic Spaces. These have included mostly women, such as Kristy Thirsk (of Rose Chronicles), Sarah McLachlan, Leigh Nash (of Sixpence None the Richer), Elsieanne Caplette (of Elsiane), Lisa Gerrard (sampled only), Jaël (of Swiss band Lunik), Camille Henderson, Nerina Pallot, Emily Haines (of Metric), Jacqui Hunt (of Single Gun Theory), Isabel Bayrakdarian and Shelley Harland. Other than Leeb, only three males have contributed vocals to a Delerium album: Matthew Sweet (""Daylight"", on Poem), Greg Froese (""Apparition"", on Nuages du Monde), and Michael Logen (""Days Turn into Nights"", on Music Box Opera); in addition, the noted griot Baaba Maal was sampled (""Awakenings, on ""Spiritual Archives"").
The Mediæval Bæbes provided the vocal track for, and starred in the video of, Aria; the vocals are an adapted version of the vocals from ""All Turns to Yesterday"" on the Bæbes' Worldes Blysse album. They are also featured on two tracks from Delerium's 2006 album, Nuages du Monde.
Although it may be argued that Front Line Assembly has the largest cult following of all Leeb and associates projects, Delerium is undoubtedly the most financially successful. In addition to these two mainstays, related collaborations between Leeb and Fulber, Peterson, and/or Balch include Equinox, Intermix, Noise Unit, Pro-Tech, and Synæsthesia, among others. In addition, in 2007 Leeb and Fulber collaborated with Leigh Nash under the name Fauxliage. Rhys Fulber has also maintained a solo project Conjure One since his temporary exit from Delerium.

Music
The single ""Silence"", featuring vocals by Sarah McLachlan, reached number three on the UK music charts. In 2000, three years after Karma was released, notable DJs such as Tiësto and Airscape produced remixes of ""Silence"", which generated interest and gained considerable radio airplay for the original track, albeit most airplay was for the remixes.
In 2003, Delerium embarked on their first tour, with vocals performed by Kristy Thirsk and Shelley Harland. In January 2005, Delerium performed at the One World benefit concert in Vancouver for the 2004 Asian tsunami, where ""Silence"" was performed live for the first time with Sarah McLachlan. The song has been described as one of the greatest trance songs of all time.

Awards
Delerium has received two Juno Awards for Best Dance Recording: in 1998 for ""Euphoria (Rabbit in the Moon Mix)"", and in 2000 for ""Silence"".

Film composing works have included the score for ""Postmortem Bliss""   by noted director Floria Sigismondi as well as ""Eve"" and ""DadaDum"" for Canadian-based director/fine artist Britt Randle. ""DadaDum"" screened at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival as a Best Short Film nominee.

Devin Townsend,"Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He founded extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007. He has also had an extensive solo career and has released a total of 28 albums across all of his projects as of 2022.
After performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered in 1993 by a record label who asked him to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, he was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on his 1995 solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, which he released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band of the same name, with whom he released the critically acclaimed album City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent HevyDevy Records label.
Townsend's solo albums have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians and are a mix of hard rock, progressive metal, ambient, and new-age. In 2002, he formed the Devin Townsend Band, which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. This band began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011 and each written in a different genre. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.
Across all his bands and solo projects, Townsend has released 23 studio albums and four live albums. His trademark production style, featuring a heavily multi-tracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Robert Fripp and Frank Zappa. His vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, while his musical style is rooted in metal and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.

Biography
Early musical career (1972–1994)
Devin Garrett Townsend was born in New Westminster on May 5, 1972. His parents are of Irish and British descent, with his father working in the restaurant industry. He picked up the banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was 12. As a young teenager, he befriended Brian ""Beav"" Waddell, who would later play guitars as part of the Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project. He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school, and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud, both of whom would later become members of Townsend's flagship band, Strapping Young Lad. In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as ""just as violent as Strapping Young Lad"".
Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. Relativity Records responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, Promise. Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai. Impressed with Townsend's vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album Sex & Religion. After recording Sex & Religion, Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album. Townsend soon landed a second tour, this time with the opening band of Vai's tour, the Wildhearts. He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe, and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge. Ginger, the band's frontman, remained close friends with Townsend, later co-writing several songs on Infinity and the Christeen + 4 Demos EP.
While on tour with the Wildhearts, Townsend formed a short-lived thrash metal project with Metallica's then-bassist Jason Newsted. The band, known as IR8, featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and Tom Hunting of Exodus on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. ""People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true,"" he explains. ""People took this project way too seriously."" A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation.
Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. ""I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality,"" he later reflected. ""This combination was appalling."" He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite touring with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. ""I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve,"" he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from Monte Conner, then-A&R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. After being briefly signed by the label, the offer was ultimately rescinded by Cees Wessels, the owner of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as ""just noise"".

Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing through Infinity (1994–1998)
In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make ""some extreme albums"". He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label, and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album Millennium and the 1995 album Hard Wired by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. ""At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have,"" he later explained. ""I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music."" Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, which was released in April 1995.
Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded a rock opera in 1996 entitled Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics. Written and recorded in under a month, the album tells the fictional story of a death metal band from Poland that sells out becoming a punk rock band to achieve mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album.
Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record City, including prolific metal drummer Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel, Death, Testament), along with Townsend's former bandmates Jed Simon on guitar and Byron Stroud on bass. The industrial-influenced album was released in 1997. To this day, the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad's best work, with Metal Maniacs calling it ""groundbreaking"" and Revolver naming it ""one of the greatest metal albums of all time"". Townsend himself considers it the band's ""ultimate"" album. Later that year, Townsend released his second solo album, Ocean Machine: Biomech. The album featured a mix of hard rock, ambient, and progressive rock.
Dating back to the Sex and Religion tour, Townsend had been writing solo material for a project called Ocean Machine. The album, initially entitled Biomech, was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on HevyDevy Records, a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons, Ocean Machine: Biomech was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings, rerecorded the entire album, and finally released in Japan on July 21, 1997.
During this period, Townsend was also asked to audition for the lead vocalist spot in Judas Priest after Rob Halford's departure. Though a fan of the band, he turned down the offer, explaining that: ""No one would want to see Devin Townsend singing for Judas Priest. I mean, it's ridiculous.""
After the completion of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. He explained, ""I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand."" In December 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder ""gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's City record and Ocean Machine: Biomech."" After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that ""everything just clicked"" and he was able to write his third solo album, Infinity, which he described as ""the parent project"" of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. Infinity was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited Infinity as his favorite solo record.
With Infinity, Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name, dropping the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine: Biomech, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.

Physicist and Terria (1999–2001)
Townsend's next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called Fizzicist, which they described as ""heavier than Strapping Young Lad"". When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted's Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich learned of the project. Hetfield was ""fucking pissed"" that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects, although Townsend would later downplay Metallica's role in Newsted's unavailability. With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, entitling it Physicist. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it, the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album. The thrash-influenced Physicist was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsend's career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed, and Townsend considers it his worst album to date.
Feeling he had ""ostracized a bunch of fans"" with Physicist, Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record. Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an ""introspective"" album dedicated to his homeland. He produced and recorded Terria, a ""highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness"" album, with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited Ween's White Pepper as an inspiration for the album. Terria was released in November 2001.

Strapping Young Lad through Synchestra (2002–2006)
Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, Strapping Young Lad, as an emotional response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States. ""If the world's about to blow up,"" said Townsend, ""let's write the soundtrack for it."" The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the ""hostile"" lyrics of City. Musically, Strapping Young Lad was less industrial than City, and more reminiscent of death metal, with a ""larger-than-life"" rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly, Grotus, and Samael's Passage as influences. The self-titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to City, but it was the band's first charting album, entering at 97th place on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.

While Strapping Young Lad was being reunited, Townsend formed a new, permanent band ""on par with Strapping"" to record and tour for his solo releases. The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian ""Beav"" Waddell on guitar, Mike Young on bass, Ryan Van Poederooyen on drums, and Dave Young on keyboards. Townsend performed guitar, vocals, and production, as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend worked on the band's first album, Accelerated Evolution, at the same time he was working on Strapping Young Lad, spending half the week on one and half on the other. Accelerated Evolution, named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year, was released a month after Strapping Young Lad. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called it ""the album of the year"", praising it for ""the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy 'n' rockin' yet majestic and beautiful."" Prior to the formation of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup; the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of Accelerated Evolution, Townsend's two bands toured separately for their separate albums.
Strapping Young Lad began working on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's previous album did not live up to expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. During the process of writing and recording the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder because he began expressing doubt about the initial diagnosis, and decided to stop taking the medication, but continued with his substance abuse, and he eventually ""flipped out"" during the process, and later called the resulting album ""toxic"" and ""psychologically very unhealthy"". Although Townsend considered the album an ""impenetrable mass of technicality"", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.
Shortly thereafter Townsend began putting together the next Devin Townsend Band record, with the working title Human. Townsend intended the album as the more ""pleasant"" counterpart to Alien. ""It's basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with Alien for a while."" The album ended up being renamed Synchestra and was released in January 2006. Townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in Synchestra, blending his trademark ""pop metal"" with influences from folk, polka, and Middle Eastern music.
The final Strapping Young Lad album, The New Black, was released later in 2006.

Ziltoid the Omniscient and hiatus (2006–2008)
Townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family. From home, Townsend completed his second solo ambient album, The Hummer, releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.
In May 2007, Townsend released Ziltoid the Omniscient, a tongue-in-cheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien. This was truly a solo album; he programmed the drums using Drumkit from Hell, a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by Tomas Haake of Meshuggah and played all other instruments himself. Shortly after the album's release, Townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or the Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was ""burnt out on travelling, touring, and self promotion"" and wished to do production work, write albums, and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring.
In 2008, Townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse (see Musician cameos in Metalocalypse for more). The original character design for Pickles the Drummer, one of the series' main characters, bore a striking resemblance to Townsend. The series' co-creator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. ""We made sure he didn't look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that.""

Creation of the Devin Townsend Project (2008–2012)
After removing himself from the music industry, Townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking. Townsend found it ""disconcerting"" that he had difficulty writing music without drugs, and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician. He spent a year producing albums in absence of writing, but found it unrewarding and decided to ""pick up the guitar and just write"". This began a period of ""self discovery"" where he learned ""how to create without drugs"".
Over two years, Townsend wrote over 60 songs, and found that they fit into ""four distinct styles"". In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a four-album series called Devin Townsend Project, with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being ""accountable"" for the persona he projects to the public. The project's concept includes a different ""theme"" and a different group of musicians on each album.
Ki, the first album of the Devin Townsend Project tetralogy was written to ""set the stage"" for the subsequent albums. Townsend channelled his new-found control and sobriety into Ki, a ""tense, quiet"" album, which contrasts with much of the music he had been known for. Additional female vocals were provided by Ché Aimee Dorval (Casualties of Cool). Ki was released in May 2009. 

The second entry, a ""commercial, yet heavy"" album called Addicted, was released in November 2009 and features lead vocals from Townsend and Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen. Brian ""Beav"" Waddell was recruited from the Devin Townsend Band to play bass.
Townsend returned to the stage in January 2010, touring North America with headliner Between the Buried and Me as well as Cynic and Scale the Summit. This was followed by a headlining tour in Australia and a series of high-profile shows in Europe (for example co-headlining the Brutal Assault festival in Czech Republic). He headlined a North American tour with UK label mates TesseracT supporting, which began in October 2010, and toured in Europe with support from Aeon Zen and Anneke van Giersbergen.
The third and fourth albums in the Devin Townsend Project series, Deconstruction and Ghost, were released simultaneously on June 21, 2011. In December 2011 all four Devin Townsend Project albums with additional material were released as the Contain Us box set. Townsend performed all four of Devin Townsend Project albums in London and recorded them for a DVD box set called By a Thread: Live in London 2011 that was released on June 18, 2012. The first three shows were held at the University of London Union, November 10–12, 2011. Ki, Addicted, and Deconstruction were each performed on one night, respectively. The show for Ghost was held at the Union Chapel, Islington on November 13, 2011. These four shows were each entitled ""An Evening with the Devin Townsend Project"".
Despite the Devin Townsend Project being originally a four-album series, Townsend decided to continue working under the moniker and released the fifth album, Epicloud on September 18, 2012. Again featuring Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals, Epicloud appeared on several European charts, peaking at number 8 in Finland. On October 27, 2012, Townsend performed a one-off show covering his musical career called The Retinal Circus at Roundhouse in London. The 3-hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 30, 2013. Also in 2012, Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album Noistalgia. He also produced the record.
Another project Townsend has mentioned several times between 2009 and 2012 is Obviouser, an album featuring ""creepy, bass driven apocalyptic music"" created with an ""Ampeg rig"" and an ""Icelandic choir"". Working with many projects simultaneously at that time, Townsend stated in 2012 the Obviouser project is vying for pole position until ""he wakes up and says 'he wants to do it'"".

Casualties of Cool and Z2 (2012–2014)
After Deconstruction and Ghost, Townsend announced a new album, Casualties of Cool, with which he started to work after the release of Epicloud. The album features Ché Aimee Dorval (from Ki) on vocals and Morgan Ågren on drums. Townsend described the album sounds like ""haunted Johnny Cash songs"" and ""late night music"", highlighting it will be different than anything he has done before. Townsend referred the music of the album to be ""closest to his heart"" at this point of his life, and that it is an important and satisfying project he does not want to rush.

The album was completed in November 2013, and a bonus disc was also made for the album, containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from Ghost 2, the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from Ghost. Originally in 2012, Townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the Devin Townsend Project series, but he ultimately confirmed that Casualties of Cool is its own project. Townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through PledgeMusic to support the release of the album. The funding quickly reached its goal, and all additional funds were put directly to Townsend's upcoming projects. Casualties of Cool was released on May 14, 2014. The album was re-issued worldwide on January 15, 2016, containing an additional DVD with live footage from the 2014 concert at the Union Chapel in London.
From 2009, Townsend worked on a long-running album project called Z2, a sequel to the album Ziltoid the Omniscient (2007). Originally in 2012, he teased he ""may have just written the heaviest thing (he's) ever done"" for the album, and stated there might a surprising lack of Ziltoid himself appearing on the album. However, in August 2013, a London-based radio station, TeamRock Radio, aired the first episode of Ziltoid Radio, a satirical radio show hosted solely by Ziltoid, this being one element of the Z2 project. Townsend also discussed a ""ZTV"" or ""Ziltoid TV"" to precede the album. Townsend later stated he found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing, stating ""it takes a lot of effort"" to keep the content and its tongue-in-cheek humour entertaining.

After writing ideas for over 70 songs, Townsend stated he would finally finish the whole project, followed by the announcement the album would be released on October 27, 2014. The recording process started in May 2014, and the final project includes the album, a Ziltoid TV program and a live show, with a ""big graphic novel comic"" and a documentary. The album itself is a double album, with disc one featuring Devin Townsend Project material and disc two containing the main album. According to Townsend, the album's theme is ""Ziltoid against the world"". The Devin Townsend Project disc is called Sky Blue and the Ziltoid disc is called Dark Matters.
After finishing the album, Townsend stated the project was ""punishing"" and an ""absolute nightmare to complete"" due to amount of material against tight schedules. He also described the hardship of the project by telling ""if he was ever going to start drinking [again], the last months would have been it"", but now ""he's starting to get excited again"". Later, ""after the chaos of finishing it had subsided"", Townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result.
Townsend recently discussed at least a year-long hiatus, beginning after the Z2 show taking place at the Royal Albert Hall on April 13, 2015. During the indefinitely long break Townsend intends to ""recharge his batteries"", ""get some inspiration and experiences"" and to ""see what the next chapter holds"" for him.

Transcendence (2014–2017)
In 2014, Townsend recorded a poppy-sounding song in Los Angeles with producer Brian Howes, but has decided against releasing. Townsend mentioned that he is against the project being contrived due to the current hard rock undertones in popular music. He described it as a ""lukewarm heavy metal Devin song"". On December 11, 2015, Townsend announced via Twitter that he was recording vocals for a song by Steve Vai.
In early 2016, Townsend completed the seventh DTP album, entitled Transcendence at Armoury Studios in Vancouver. The album was released on September 9. On March 17, 2017, Devin Townsend Project played Ocean Machine live in its entirety at Hammersmith Apollo. On October 30, 2017, Devin announced that he was working on four new albums.

Break from Devin Townsend Project, Empath (2018–2020)
On January 31, 2018, Townsend announced on his Facebook page that he was taking a break from the Devin Townsend Project and focusing on a number of other projects, including the four new albums previously announced.
On January 15, 2019, Townsend announced his album, Empath, on which work had been completed, and slated for release on March 29, 2019. The album's purpose is ""to see what would happen if all the styles that make up [Townsend's] current interests were finally represented in one place."", and about ""allowing the audience a feeling for a variety of musical emotions. The musical dynamics represented on this single album are broad, challenging, and immense. To approach this sort of work with a long history of what makes heavy music 'heavy', allows this to be done with a type of power rarely heard."" Guests on the album include former Frank Zappa collaborators Mike Keneally, Morgan Ågren and Steve Vai, as well as Samus Paulicelli, Chad Kroeger, Anneke Van Giersbergen, Ché Aimee Dorval from Casualties of Cool, and Ryan Dahle. A series of documentary videos detailing the making of Empath has been released on YouTube. He appeared on the YouTube show Tuesday Talks hosted by Mary Spender.
On March 12, 2020, Townsend postponed the remainder of his Empath Vol. 1 North American Tour due to the coronavirus pandemic. Four days later, on March 16, 2020, Townsend launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of the canceled tour. It raised $80,804 of the $50,000 goal. As a ""thank you"" to his fans, Townsend launched what he dubbed ""Quarantine Project"", releasing new music in the process. Among the new tracks is a new mix of ""A New Reign"" from the Sky Blue album. Townsend collaborated with the likes of Kat Epple, Samus Paulicelli, Morgan Ågren, Federico Paulovich, Ché Aimee Dorval, Mattias Eklundh, Wes Hauch and Liam Wilson.

The Puzzle, Snuggles and Lightwork (2020–present)
In April 2020, Townsend began uploading a chronological series of podcasts on his official YouTube channel, with each episode discussing one or two of the albums in his discography. These podcasts have been monologue discussions and reflections on the albums themselves, the influences, the personnel, and the state of Townsend's life during the times these albums were being written and recorded.
In August 2020, Townsend announced the upcoming release of Empath Live Volume 1: Order of Magnitude, a live concert recorded during the first Empath Tour, and Empath Live Volume 2: By Request, a virtual concert for fans in lieu of the second tour, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 5, he hosted a streaming premiere of Empath Live Volume 2, a prerecorded virtual show featuring Samus Paulicelli on drums, Wes Hauch on guitar, Liam Wilson on bass, and Townsend on guitar and vocals. Each of them performed separately in front of green screens, with eight different camera setups each, to enhance the virtual concert experience. In 2021, he released two live albums: Devolution Series #1 - Acoustically Inclined, Live in Leeds, which was a recording of an acoustic show in Leeds in 2019, released on March 19 and Devolution Series #2 – Galactic Quarantine which was a recording of the aforementioned virtual show, released on June 25.
Townsend's next project was a double release including the albums The Puzzle and Snuggles. The two albums were released on 3 December 2021, after two release delays ""due to a massive shortage in raw materials and plastics, preventing the physical releases, particularly the boxsets and vinyls, from getting completed and shipped out in time."".  The Puzzle is based on the chaotic experience of the 2020 pandemic while Snuggles is said to be more calm; both albums are ""collaborative multimedia art projects"" accompanied by films and, in the case of The Puzzle, a graphic novel. These were followed by another solo album in 2022 called Lightwork. A tour in support of Lightwork was announced with dates in April–May 2022. Ultimately, Townsend cancelled his solo tour dates in favour of opening for American progressive metal band Dream Theater's European Tour in early 2022. with his Lightwork tour being postponed until early 2023.
On October 16, 2023, via Inside Out Music's YouTube channel, Townsend announced a new podcast series by publishing its first episode. The podcast was to be published monthly via the same channel. Based on the first episode, as well as Townsend's Instagram, the new series' aim was, as opposed to the original Devin Townsend Podcast series (published on Townsend's YouTube channel), not to analyze his past records, but rather to 'focus on a real time observation of the next ones.'

Personal life
Townsend is married to Tracy Turner, whom he began dating when he was 19. She gave birth to their first son, Reyner Liam Johnstan Townsend, on October 4, 2006. Townsend and his family live in the Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam.
Townsend has been a vegetarian for ethical reasons since around the early 1990s, but does not consider himself an activist. He has revealed in interviews that he suffers from depression. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around 1998, a condition that was unknowingly exacerbated by his alcohol and drug use at the time; he has been sober and free of anti-psychotic medication since 2007.

Musical style
Projects
Townsend designed his two main projects, the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material, as counterparts. Strapping Young Lad's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres: death metal, thrash metal, black metal and industrial metal. Townsend's solo material blends many genres and influences, with elements of atmospheric ambient music, hard rock and prog rock, along with glam metal and arena rock. He described it as ""a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal. Dense and produced with a large amount of ambient elements."" Despite Strapping Young Lad's greater mainstream acceptance, Townsend identifies more with his solo material, and has never intended Strapping Young Lad to be the focus of his music.

Production style
Townsend is synesthetic, experiencing musical notes as colors and shapes. Partly due to this, he simultaneously composes and mixes his music in what he describes as ""all autopilot"", practically without any deliberate application of music theory. As a self-proclaimed ""fan of multitracking"", Townsend has developed a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric, layered ""wall of sound"". Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions, which ""are always marked by a sense of adventure, intrigue, chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics"", according to Mike G. of Metal Maniacs. Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music, alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, Logic Pro and Waves Audio plugins. Townsend's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself. He has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein, August Burns Red and Misery Signals.

Playing style
Townsend mainly uses Open C tuning for both six and seven string guitar. He now also uses Open B tuning and Open B flat tuning on his six string guitars. Townsend's technique varies from fingerpicking, power chords and polychords to sweep-picked arpeggios and tapping techniques. He is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects. He has expressed that he has no taste for shred guitar, saying that ""Musically it doesn't do anything for me"" and that he only solos when he thinks that he can within the context of the song.

Vocals
Townsend employs a variety of vocal techniques in his work, including screaming, growling or even falsetto. Daniel Lake of Decibel Magazine classifies Townsend's voice as a ""semi-operatic tenor"".

Influences
Townsend draws influence from a wide range of music genres, most prominently heavy metal. Townsend has cited, among others, Judas Priest, W.A.S.P., Broadway musicals, ABBA, new-age music, Zoviet France, King's X, Morbid Angel, Barkmarket, Grotus, Jane's Addiction, Fear Factory and Godflesh as his influences, and has also expressed his admiration for Meshuggah on several occasions, calling them ""the best metal band on the planet"". Townsend lists Paul Horn and Ravi Shankar as the ""two most important musicians in his life"". The two songs that Townsend credits with changing the way he thought about music are ""The Burning Down"" by King's X, and ""Up the Beach"" by Jane's Addiction. City was influenced by New York noise rock bands such as Foetus and Cop Shoot Cop, and The New Black's influences were Meshuggah, and ""more traditional metal"" like Metallica. He is also influenced by orchestral and classical composers such as John Williams, Trevor Jones and Igor Stravinsky.

Equipment
Townsend played ESP six and seven-string guitars from 1994 to 2009 during his endorsement with ESP. In the early days of Strapping Young Lad, he was seen playing an ESP Flying V-style 6-string with a single EMG 81 pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP Explorer-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP Telecaster models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27"" baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP's Stephen Carpenter signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS during Accelerated Evolution and Synchestra-era shows (mainly for performing ""Deadhead""). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a Seymour Duncan STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.
After returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).
In 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: ""The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V's. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand.""
For Strapping Young Lad and solo projects from 1996 – 2004, Townsend mainly used the Peavey 5150 head, with Mesa Boogie and Marshall 4x12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a Maxon OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2x12 cabinets, and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s Roland GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a TC Electronic G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes D'Addario Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.
As of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wet-dry-wet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows, the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiler Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.
At the 2016 NAMM Show, Townsend introduced a signature set of Fishman pickups in the Fluence line and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes, the Fishman pickups and the Evertune Bridge.
In November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced, explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote, ""I was working with many amp companies, but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL+ for my ENTIRE chain. I use Framus Guitars, Fishman Pickups, 
D'Addario strings, Fractal Axe Fx. One Rig to rule them all =)""
In 2018 Mooer released the Devin Townsend signature Ocean Machine pedal, featuring twin delays, reverb and looper with infinite feedback in a genuine collaboration which Townsend enthusiastically recommended. The relatively unusual pedal design was received well, with 5 star reviews.
In 2023, Devin paired with guitar pick maker Acoustik Attak to release his signature Devin Townsend ""Earthtone"" pick.

About
Diane grew up in California on a working cattle ranch. She wrote her first song at the age of three and started playing guitar at the age of seven.
Since childhood, she has endured a lifetime of medical ailments resulting from complete AV block (atrial ventricular block) in her heart. She has had multiple heart surgeries and over 30 major surgeries total.
In 2004 she was an official spokesperson for the American Heart Association. As a spokesperson, she regularly shared her story with kids who also experienced heart defects from a young age.
She has had 6 pacemaker implants throughout her life, and received her first pacemaker implant at age 20.
Due to the complete AV Block in her heart, doctors told her she would not be able to survive without a pacemaker. Heart monitors indicated that her heart would stop beating for up to a full minute at a time.
Miraculously, after years of surgery, in 2022 her doctor reported that her heart was fully healed, and the pacemaker was turned off.
She found healing through the vibrations of her guitar and her voice, and this started her journey to make healing music to help others.
In 2021, she released The Healing Heart album. The song ""Safe in the Angel’s Wing"" was written after her recovery from a 3rd pacemaker implant. Minutes after the pacemaker was in, she went into cardiac arrest.
While unconscious, she had a vision of being protected in an Angel's wing during the procedure. The image stayed with her and inspired the song and album.
Diane strongly believes in the power of the voice as an instrument for wellbeing, including chanting, humming, and other vocal tones.
""It’s comforting to hear a human voice, or to imagine it is an Angel watching over you through some extremely dark times"" she says. ""Hearing another voice makes us feel less alone.""

Dntel,"James Scott ""Jimmy"" Tamborello (born February 17, 1975), also known by his stage name Dntel , is an American electronic music artist and DJ. Aside from his main solo project, Tamborello is also known as a member of the groups The Postal Service, Headset, Strictly Ballroom, and Figurine, where he is sometimes cited as James Figurine.

Personal life
Tamborello's father was a jazz saxophone player, flautist, and a songwriter for many Santa Barbara, California-based bands. His mother, Joyce Menges was an actress who starred in the sitcom To Rome with Love starring John Forsythe, Kay Medford, and Melanie Fullerton, in 1969, and later in the Walt Disney Productions film Now You See Him Now You Don't, starring Kurt Russell, in 1972.

Musical career and Dntel
Tamborello first began creating music in 1989, when he was in junior high school in Santa Barbara. His father bought him a drum machine, a sequencer, a keyboard and an eight track recorder, primarily for the possibility to create music on his own. Tamborello recorded an album under the name Antihouse in 1993, which was released the following year, then beginning work on the first Dntel EP. During these years, Tamborello attended Loyola Marymount University where he was a DJ and music director at KXLU. He engineered on several albums recorded at the station including ""KXLU LIVE: Volume 1,"" for which he also designed the album artwork. Tamborello was also the bass player for a band known as Strictly Ballroom. The band was often described as ""Enocore,"" as Brian Eno soundscapes were an important influence in their music. Strictly Ballroom recorded one album, Hide Here Forever, which was released in 1997 on the Waxploitation Records label. They released a single in 1995 titled ""Dear XXX"" on the Chou Chou records label.
A collection of the demos during the period of 1995 to 1997 was released as Early Works for Me If It Works for You, in 1998, and work from the first Dntel EP was released as Something Always Goes Wrong, in 2000, both on the Phthalo label. As a pioneer of contemporary glitch and electronica, Dntel gained a cult following. After writing a track for the Voices in My Lunchbox collaboration for the Plug Research label, he was asked to work with them. Tamborello released a 12-inch LP, Anywhere Anyone, in 2000.
Tamborello released the debut Dntel full-length album, Life Is Full of Possibilities, in 2001. The album featured several guest artists on vocals and instruments, including Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Mia Doi Todd, fellow Figurine member Meredith Figurine, Chris Gunst of Beachwood Sparks, Brian McMahan of Slint, The For Carnation, and Rachel Haden of that dog. The track ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" from the album was very well-received, which led to the song being released in 2002 as the only single from Life Is Full of Possibilities. A remix of the song by Superpitcher was voted the 17th best dance track of the decade by a Resident Advisor poll in 2010.
On April 24, 2007, Tamborello released his third album Dumb Luck on Subpop Records to generally positive critical reception. This, coinciding with Death Cab For Cutie's release, Narrow Stairs moved any future plans of The Postal Service recording past the end of the decade. Tamborello released a surprise new album called Hate In My Heart on August 2, 2018, through Leaving Records.

Figurine
Since 1994, Tamborello has also been a member of the electropop band Figurine. Consisting of Tamborello (as James Figurine), Meredith Figurine, and David Figurine, the trio were high school friends and created music based mostly on the theme of long-distance love, releasing their debut album, Transportation + Communication = Love, in 1999. The group released their second album, The Heartfelt, in 2001, and a remix album, Reconfigurine, in 2002.
Tamborello released a solo album under the name James Figurine, Mistake Mistake Mistake Mistake, in 2006, featuring a downtempo electronica style.

The Postal Service
The success of the collaboration between Tamborello and Ben Gibbard on the song ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" from Life Is Full of Possibilities, which features lyrics and vocals from Gibbard, led the two to form their own side-project The Postal Service in 2001. The duo released their debut album, Give Up, in 2003 on Sub Pop Records, receiving very positive reviews from critics and eventual platinum certification from the Recording Industry of America. The album spawned the successful singles ""Such Great Heights"", ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"", and ""We Will Become Silhouettes"". Along with additional member Jenny Lewis, who performed vocals on the album, the group toured in support of Give Up despite their main projects also being active at the time.
The Postal Service became largely inactive after 2005, until 2013 when the group reunited for a tour to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Give Up. However, on August 3, 2013, Ben Gibbard announced via Twitter that The Postal Service would permanently disband after the tour.
On December 9, 2009, Rolling Stone named the song ""Such Great Heights"" the 27th best song of the decade.
In December 2022, the group announced a 2023 tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie to celebrate the twentieth anniversaries of Give Up and Transatlanticism.

Other projects
Tamborello is also the host of a regular music show called Dying Songs heard on the internet radio station Dublab. In 2004, Tamborello was credited for programming on the song ""Take It Easy (Love Nothing)"" by Bright Eyes, which reached number two on the Billboard US Singles Chart.
As Headset he collaborated with Plug Research record label owner Allen Avanessian and a number of guest rappers on the 2004 album Space Settings.

Equipment
Tamborello uses a large variety of electronic equipment to create his sound. He uses Logic Pro for programming, a Rode k2 microphone for vocals, and Dynaudio Air series speakers. His studio has a glockenspiel, Avalon Design VT-747sp compressor, MicroKorg, Elektron Machinedrum, Vostok Matrixsynth, Elektron Monomachine, Vermona Retroverb, Empirical Labs EL8X Distressor Compressor, MOTU MIDI Timepiece, Vermona DRM1 MKII (drum machine), Dave Smith Poly Evolver Rack, Minimoog Voyager, two Motu 828 MKII, Mackie 1604 mixer, Kurzweil K2000 synthesizer, Jomox Xbase 999, Moogerfooger MF-104Z Analog Delay, DigiTech IPS33 Smartshift Intelligent Pitch Shifter, Nord Modular G1, an Omnichord, accordions, jingle bells, Line 6 Delay, and an M-Audio Radium MIDI controller.

Don Falcone,"Don Falcone (born November 5, 1958) is an American producer and multi-instrumentalist, and the guiding light behind the Spirits Burning space-rock collective. In Spirits Burning and other offshoot bands and projects, his primary collaborations have been with Albert Bouchard, Bridget Wishart, Cyrille Verdeaux, Daevid Allen, and English writer and musician Michael Moorcock.
Falcone was a member of Thessalonians and the original Melting Euphoria, and had a solo project called Spaceship Eyes.

Biography
Early recordings
Falcone appeared on three albums released by Silent Records in 1993. 
He played keyboards and synthesizer on the album In A Garden of Eden by Heavenly Music Corporation, was in Satellite IV, which did the track “In A Sugarcube,” on the Fifty Years Of Sunshine compilation, and became a member of Thessalonians. On the Thessalonians album Soulcraft, Falcone played synthesizer.
In 1994, Falcone formed Melting Euphoria with Mychael Merrill and Anthony Who. Focusing on space rock, their debut recording was ""Through the Strands of Time""; Falcone left the group soon after its release.
Falcone played on two more Silent Records full-length albums as part of a trio, with fellow Thessolonians Kim Cascone and Paul Neyrinck, primarily under the name Spice Barons. Spice Barons also recorded as Astralfish, Hydrosphere, Patternclear, and Satellite IV.  Spice Barons, Patternclear, Astralfish and Hydrosphere appear on the Silent Records compilation UFA. The trio subsequently did an album under the name Spice Barons in 1995.

As Spaceship Eyes
In the mid-‘90's, Falcone started a solo project, Spaceship Eyes. It began as a synth project, and moved towards experimental drum ‘n' bass when he got signed to Cleopatra Records. The project was included on several drum and bass compilations and released the single ""Cheebahcabra"" on Hypnotic Records in 1997, followed by the LPs ""Truth in the Eyes of a Spaceship"" in 1998 and ""Of Cosmic Repercussions"" in 2000. Three of Falcone's Spaceship Eyes pieces appeared in the 1999 cult rave film Better Living Through Circuitry. Most notably, Mind The Alien from Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship was used as the film's opening track.

With Spirits Burning
In 1996, Falcone resurrected Spirits Burning. Spirits Burning was one of his first San Francisco bands, for which Falcone played bass and keyboards. Falcone set Spirits Burning on their continuing mission just as the internet began to open up an index of collaborative possibilities that studio recordings and logistics previously precluded: the chance for content-creators to recruit musicians on an ad hoc basis across the ether; musicians they’d have scant hope of playing with face-to-face. In the space-rock community, Falcone has done particularly well out of this approach. A survey of his first 10 years under the Spirits Burning banner throws up some surprising contributors (including Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree’s Steven Wilson, and High Tide’s Simon House).
In 2017, Falcone performed live with Spirits Burning, alongside Steve Bemand, Richard Chadwick, Kev Ellis, Colin Kafka, Martin Plumley, and Bridget Wishart. Falcone played keyboards and also sang lead vocals on two songs.

Various collaborations
Falcone, Albert Bouchard (formerly of Blue Öyster Cult), and writer Michael Moorcock have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Michael Moorcock) to adapt three of Moorcock's novels: An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands, and The End of All Songs. Additionally, Falcone produced the 2019 Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix release Live At The Terminal Café and was the executive producer for the band's Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions release in 2012.
Falcone and Bridget Wishart (formerly of Hawkwind) have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including CDs released under the name Spirits Burning & Bridget Wishart), plus have an instrumental project called Astralfish.
Falcone and Cyrille Verdeaux of Clearlight have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Clearlight). Additionally, Falcone produced the 2014 Clearlight release Impressionist Symphony.
Collaborating with Daevid Allen, Falcone released Glissando Grooves on Voiceprint Records in 2006.  Falcone and Allen were part of Weird Biscuit Teatime, which released their first album on Voiceprint in 2005, and the 2015 follow-up, ""Elevenses,"" which was released under the band name Daevid Allen Weird Quartet. Falcone and Allen have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including a single released under the name Spirits Burning & Daevid Allen). In addition to Spirits Burning, Allen has contributed to other Falcone bands: Astralfish, Fireclan (which included members of Melting Euphoria), and Quiet Celebration (an ambient-ethno-jazz quartet).

Noh Poetry Records
Falcone is a co-founder of Noh Poetry Records, a California-based independent record label, whose releases include a Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix album, as well as Where Stalks The Sandman: An Ambient Collection, which includes pieces by Steven Wilson, Praxis, Kim Cascone, Don Falcone, and others.

Complete discography"
Dreampunk,"Dreampunk is a microgenre of electronic music characterized by its focus on cinematic ambience and field recordings, combined with various traits and techniques from electronic genres such as techno, jungle, electro, and dubstep.

History
Dreampunk emerged in the mid-2010s. Many early dreampunk artists drew influence from film scores, vaporwave, and drum and bass. Dreampunk originates from the debut of 2814, the ambient duo composed of Luke Laurila (t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者) and David Russo (Hong Kong Express). The name is derived from the word cyberpunk because of its frequent use of imagined metropolitan spaces in its sound design, evoking the experience of walking through a futuristic city.

Origins
Dreampunk initially began on January 29, 2014, when British musician David Russo launched the Dream Catalogue label, which specialized in vaporwave and ""dream music"" (the forename to dreampunk). Inspired by the films of Wong Kar-Wai, Russo explored dreamlike ambient music under the name Hong Kong Express. After befriending American vaporwave producer Luke Laurila (t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者), the two swiftly released solo albums on Dream Catalogue, across many anonymous aliases. In October 2014, Russo and Laurila formed a collaborative project, 2814, a duo which would garner praise from critics and internet users alike. In 2015, Vice published an article commending 2814's second cyberpunk ambient vaporwave album, 新しい日の誕生 (Birth of a New Day), calling it a ""slip into a world of neon and rain, mist and memory"". Drifting from their predecessors, 2814 were steadfast about not using samples, which contrasted the mindset of the label's other musicians, like 猫 シ Corp, Death’s Dynamic Shroud, Nmesh, and Vaperror. Despite their success on Bandcamp, Russo purged Dream Catalogue of many of its sampled albums to avoid copyright disputes and focus on his self-described ""dream music"". The schism between dreampunk and vaporwave was described by Russo as ""the whole dream music vibe is certainly fluid enough to encompass lots of different musical styles, while still retaining certain elements that make the label stand out as a whole—surreality, futurism, heavy concepts and story-driven projects, while vaporwave as a term and an idea has become something of a burden to everyone involved with it."" From 2016 until 2018, Russo and a new wave of artists at Dream Catalogue largely focused on wosX's tongue-in-cheek hardvapour style and the short-lived ghost tech style, giving way for other labels to lead the dreampunk movement.

Early scene
The early years of dreampunk revolved around various netlabels, which were the focal point of the community. With the adoption of Twitter messaging, net radio shows, and livestreamed festivals like SPF420, the newly formed group of artists were quick to connect with one another and subsequently release albums on each other's labels.
One of dreampunk's earliest proprietors was No Problema Tapes, the cassette oriented label run by Pablo Salas and Gonzalo Silva. The label had early ties to vaporwave and drone music, but would eventually expand into the realm of dreampunk, releasing albums from some of the community’s earliest artists (including Sangam, Renjā, and Origami Girl). On October 17, 2020, Remezcla reported that No Problema Tapes’s headquarters had completely burned down. The label was able to resume operations with the help of a fundraiser, compilation album, and by outsourcing tape production to Canada’s New Motion label.
Following dreampunk's emergence on labels like Dream Catalogue, No Problema Tapes, BLCR Laboratories, House of the Leg, Virtual Dream Plaza, among others, artists from across the internet began using the term ""dreampunk"" interchangeably with ""dream music"". During this time, producers such as Remember, CHUNGKING MANSIONS, KAGAMI Smile, and THUGWIDOW brought darker cinematic styles to the genre.
In a period of growth, dreampunk artists such as 輕描淡寫 (QMDX) and Sangam were featured alongside Disasterpeace and Merzbow on the now-defunct label, BLUDHONEY RECORDS. In its prime, BLUDHONEY's focus on vinyl and cassettes brought a professional edge to the grassroots movement. Without warning, BLUDHONEY shut down in 2018. Some artists affected by the closure include Rashida Prime, QMDX, and the duo Kuroi Ame. These artists opted to release records on VILL4IN. They would then switch over to Kuroi Ame's PURE LIFE ЧЖ label, which released its first album in September 2018.
The term dreampunk was fully adopted by the community following w u s o 命’s video essay, Dreampunk: The Soundtrack To Dreams, where he analyzed the history and stylistic features of the genre. In the late 2010s, glitch art became a prominent aesthetic for album covers, music videos, and visual albums, as was seen on emerging labels such as PURE LIFE ЧЖ and VILL4IN. During the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, the genre experienced a resurgence in virtual music festivals, including performances by Livewire, PURE LIVE, and Enter The Void.

Musical characteristics
Dreampunk primarily draws from sounds of the city, science fiction, surrealism, loneliness, love, and dreams. Musicians such as Vangelis, Burial, and Aphex Twin, as well as East Asian cinema and anime, are common inspirations within dreampunk.
Rain is a frequent field recording choice, often used as a callback to the ambience of future-noir film Blade Runner which focuses on palpable atmosphere and worldbuilding rather than plot or action. This concentration on atmosphere gives the music an immersive and dreamlike quality. This quality is further heightened by the frequent use of cassette tapes in recording and distribution.

Drone music,"Drone music, drone-based music, or simply drone, is a minimalist genre of music that emphasizes the use of sustained sounds, notes, or tone clusters called drones. It is typically characterized by lengthy compositions featuring relatively slight harmonic variations. La Monte Young, one of its 1960s originators, defined it in 2000 as ""the sustained tone branch of minimalism"". Music containing drones can be found in many regional traditions across Asia, Australia, and Europe, but the genre label is generally reserved for music originating with the Western classical tradition. Elements of drone music have been incorporated in diverse genres such as rock, ambient, and electronic music.

Overview
Music which contains drones and is rhythmically still or very slow, called ""drone music"", can be found in many parts of the world, including bagpipe traditions, among them Scottish pibroch piping; didgeridoo music in Australia, South Indian classical Carnatic music and Hindustani classical music (both of which are accompanied almost invariably by the Tanpura, a plucked, four-string instrument which is only capable of playing a drone); the sustained tones found in the Japanese gagaku classical tradition; possibly (disputed) in pre-polyphonic organum vocal music of late medieval Europe; and the Byzantine chant's ison (or drone-singing, attested after the fifteenth century). Repetition of tones, supposed to be in imitation of bagpipes, is found in a wide variety of genres and musical forms.

The modern genre also called drone music (called ""dronology"" by some books, labels and stores, to differentiate it from ethnic drone-based music) is often applied to artists who have allied themselves closely with underground music and the post-rock or experimental music genres. Drone music forms a part of the movement referred to as minimal music.
Pitchfork Media and Allmusic journalist Mark Richardson defined it thus:

The vanishing-point music created by drone elders Phill Niblock and, especially, La Monte Young is what happens when a fixation on held tones reaches a tipping point. Timbre is reduced to either a single clear instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level interaction between small clusters of ""pure"" tone becomes the music's content. This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish ""music"" from ""sound,"" discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again from scratch.""

Development
Composer La Monte Young (born 1935) is an important figure in drone music. He described himself as fascinated from a young age by droning sounds, such as ""the sound of the wind blowing"", the ""60 cycle per second drone [of] step-down transformers on telephone poles"", the tanpura drone and the alap of Indian classical music, ""certain static aspects of serialism, as in the Webern slow movement of the Symphony Opus 21"", and Japanese gagaku ""which has sustained tones in it in the instruments such as the Sho"". Young started writing music incorporating sustained tones in 1957 with the middle section of For Brass, then in 1958 what he describes as ""the first work in the history of music that is completely composed of long sustained tones and silences"" with Trio for Strings, before exploring this drone music within the Theatre of Eternal Music that he founded in 1962.
The Theatre of Eternal Music is a multi-media performance group who, in its 1960s–1970s heyday included at various times La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Tony Conrad, Angus MacLise, Terry Jennings, John Cale, Billy Name, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea and others, each from various backgrounds (classical composition and performance, painting, mathematics, poetry, jazz, etc.). Operating from the world of lofts and galleries in New York in the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies in particular, and tied to the aesthetics of Fluxus and the post-John Cage-continuum, the group gave performances on the East Coast of the United States as well as in Western Europe. These performances comprised long periods of sensory inundation with combinations of harmonic relationships, which moved slowly from one to the next by means of ""laws"" laid out by Young regarding ""allowable"" sequences and simultaneities, perhaps in imitation of Hindustani classical music which he, Zazeela and the others either studied or at least admired. The group released nothing during their lifetime (although Young and Zazeela issued a collaborative LP in 1969, and in 1970 Young contributed one side of a flexi disc accompanying an issue of Aspen magazine). The concerts themselves were influential on their own upon the art world including Karlheinz Stockhausen (whose Stimmung bears their influence most strikingly) and the drone-based minimalist works of dozens of other composers many of whom made parallel innovations including Young classmate Pauline Oliveros, or Eliane Radigue, Charlemagne Palestine, Yoshi Wada, Phill Niblock and many others.
In 2000, La Monte Young wrote: ""[About] the style of music that I originated, I believe that the sustained tone branch of minimalism, also known as 'drone music', is a fertile area for exploration.""

Rock music
Theatre of Eternal Music member John Cale extended and popularized drone techniques in 1960s rock music with his next band, the Velvet Underground (along with songwriter Lou Reed). The Velvet Underground's first EP release in 1966, entitled Loop, was an experimental drone piece created by member John Cale. The band's first album The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) laid the foundation for drone music as a rock music genre in close proximity to the art-world project of the Theatre of Eternal Music. Around this period, the Beatles also introduced elements of Indian-influenced drone music in psychedelic rock tracks such as ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (1966).
Following his departure from the Velvet Underground, John Cale went on to produce Stooges' 1969 debut album, with the final mix including his viola drone on the track ""We Will Fall"". That same year Cale also performed viola on Nico's The Marble Index (1969), on the track ""Frozen Warnings"". Later, Lou Reed issued in 1975 a double LP of multi-tracked electric-guitar feedback entitled Metal Machine Music which listed (misspelling included) ""Drone cognizance and harmonic possibilities vis a vis Lamont Young's Dream Music"" among its ""Specifications"". 
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, German rock musicians such as Can, Neu!, Kraftwerk, Cluster and Faust drew from 1960s rock groups that experimented with duration and repetition—for example the Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd, and Captain Beefheart at his most collagic—and from composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and La Monte Young. These krautrock groups influenced art rock contemporaries in their own day and punk rock and post-punk players subsequently. Tony Conrad, of the Theatre of Eternal Music, notably made a collaborative LP with Faust which included nothing but two sides of complex violin drones accompanied by a single note on bass guitar and some percussion. Single-note bass-lines also featured on Can's track ""Mother Sky"" (album Soundtracks, 1970) and the entirety of Die Krupps's first album (1979).
Drone metal was first established by Earth, a group from Olympia, Washington, formed in 1989 by minimalist musician Dylan Carlson. Earth took inspiration from the sludge metal of Melvins and the minimalist music of  
Young, Riley and Conrad. Stephen O'Malley's group Sunn O))), initially formed as a tribute to Earth, is most responsible for the contemporary prominence of the drone metal style. Boris, from Tokyo, also developed a style of drone metal, parallel with the Seattle groups, as did Corrupted, from Osaka.
In 1990, British band Spacemen 3 recorded a live 45-minute drone album entitled Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music, with liner notes by La Monte Young.

Electronic and ambient music
Across North America and Europe, some musicians sought to reconcile Asian classicalism, austere minimalism and folk music's consonant aspects in the service of spirituality. Among them was Theatre of Eternal Music alumnus Terry Riley, with his 1964 In C. Along with La Monte Young and Zazeela, Riley had become a disciple of the Hindustani classical singer Pandit Pran Nath. In parallel, then-Krautrock band Tangerine Dream and its recently departed member Klaus Schulze moved toward a more contemplative and consonant harmonic music, each releasing their own drone music album on the label Ohr in August 1972 (Zeit and Irrlicht, respectively). Throughout the 1970s, Irv Teibel released his psychoacoustic Environments series, which consisted of 30-minute, uninterrupted environmental sound and synthesized soundscapes (""Om Chant"" and ""Tintinnabulation"").
Meanwhile, as an increasingly elaborate studio technology was born during the 1970s, Brian Eno, an alumnus of the glam/art-rock band Roxy Music, postulated (drawing in part from John Cage and his antecedent Erik Satie's 1910s concept of furniture music and in part from minimalists such as La Monte Young) that ambient music was ""able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting"". While Eno's late 1970s ambient tape-music recordings are not drone music, his acknowledgment of Young (""the daddy of us all"") and his own influence on later drone music made him an undeniable link in the chain.
Klaus Wiese was a master of the Tibetan singing bowls; he created an extensive series of album releases using them, making impressive acoustic drones.

Dungeon synth,"Dungeon synth is a genre of electronic music that merges elements of black metal and dark ambient. The style emerged in the early 1990s, predominantly among members of the second wave black metal scene. 
The genre employs aesthetics and themes typically associated with black metal juxtaposed to the typical heavy tremolo-picking, blast-beats, and harsh, shrieked vocals of black metal by way of compositions of instrumental or ambient music commonly used as introductions, interludes, or ""outros"" in black metal, death metal, and heavy metal albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Though often paired with medieval and fantasy motifs throughout the 1990s onward, some prominent contemporaries of dungeon synth reject the excessive prevalence of high-fantasy themes. Dungeon synth is contentiously likened to video game music, due to fantasy influences, the usage and layering of synths, and a focus on ambience, but the Norwegian musician Mortiis (Håvard Ellefsen) and others have rejected the influence of video game soundtracks on dungeon synth. 
Mortiis is a major performer of this genre and the style is heavily prevalent in early releases such as Født til å Herske and later releases from the return to the ""Era I"" sound, chiefly Spirit of Rebellion. Other prominent contemporaries of the genre include Old Tower, Sombre Arcane, Thangorodrim, and Depressive Silence; most of which have toured or regularly performed live on top of publishing music. Mortiis, alongside Burzum, is normally cited as the de facto progenitor of the genre proper, and each is regularly cited as having influenced later acts associated with dungeon synth.

Origins
Proto-dungeon synth
Since the coining of the term, dungeon synth fans have on occasion identified disparate influences on early dungeon synth pioneers and on the rare occasion, have had their suspicions corroborated. Namely, Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze have been cited by Mortiis as early influences, as well as Skinny Puppy and Enigma. Varg Vikernes has cited Das Ich, Dead Can Dance and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky among his own influences. Finnish dungeon synth musician Tuomas M. Mäkelä of Jääportit has cited Dead Can Dance and Arcana among their influences. Robert Nusslein (founding member of Ritual) of Casket of Dreams has listed Tangerine Dream, Velvet Acid Christ, Dead Can Dance, and Death in June among his influences.
Several industrial and post-punk artists are often invoked as proto-dungeon synth artists or influences on early dungeon synth pioneers including Nurse with Wound, Death in June, In the Nursery, Cocteau Twins, Throbbing Gristle, and many other prominent industrial artists of the 1970s and 1980s.

Traditional heavy metal
Though almost universally associated with the orchestral, atmospheric, and ambient intros, interludes, and outros of 1990s black metal albums, proto-dungeon synth can also be found heavily interspersed in many of the same sections of traditional heavy metal and other extreme metal genres of the 1970s and 1980s.
Similar instances of fantastical ambient, orchestral, or neoclassical music can also be heard in Rainbow's ""Gates of Babylon"" from Long Live Rock 'n' Roll.
While less prevalent in the black metal albums of the 1990s, heavy metal has borrowed heavily from high-fantasy imagery and motifs since its fledgling days. This indelible link between heavy metal and high fantasy would eventually lead to the colloquial moniker ""castle metal"" to describe acts of the genre that are mired in the motifs typical of high fantasy art and literature. Mortiis has cited Venom, W.A.S.P., Angel Witch, Kiss, and others among his own heavy metal influences, even citing their high-fantasy leanings on occasion. Sigurd ""Satyr"" Wongraven has cited Rainbow, Black Sabbath, and other heavy metal bands among his own influences, and the members of Summoning have made similar claims regarding their earliest influences.

Kosmische musik
Various musical methods of composition prevalent in dungeon synth are often attributed to German kosmische musik artists. Kosmische musik themes were largely inspired by space travel, futurism, and industrialism rather than typical fantasy tropes, but contributed to subsequent genres by way of normalizing ""beatless"" music which would permeate industrial music and derivative forms such as Ambient and New Age, eventually influencing earlier dungeon synth musicians (or perhaps proto-dungeon synth musicians from the 1980s) and their minimal compositions which were occasionally purely ambient. While only occasionally sharing thematic overlap, dungeon synth musicians would indelibly borrow significantly from kosmische musik by way of musicology and theory.
A few typical examples of ""cosmic-oriented"" dungeon synth and adjacent releases can be found in early releases, though the style is more prevalent in contemporary works. Mortiis published a seven-inch single of comparable music on his own record label Dark Dungeon Music from his early side-project Fata Morgana. Fenriz published two albums of similar music from his own side-project Neptune Towers. The works of Solanum (one half of Depressive Silence) bear comparable themes of space in the artwork, titles, and other errata, though are not as explicitly composed with sounds reminiscent of kosmische musik. The early works of black metal musician and composer Henri Sorvali also present similar characteristics which could be associated to kosmische musik, including Lunar Womb's Astral Grief and Planets.

1990s
The origins of dungeon synth as a genre unto itself are largely rooted in the early 1990s with the release of a few specific pieces of music now retroactively called ""dungeon synth"". These include Jim Kirkwood's ""Where Shadows Lie"" released sometime in 1990, followed by ""Master of Dragons"" in 1991. During this time, Mortiis was still a member of Emperor and had yet to publish any solo material. In 1992, Kirkwood published two more releases on cassette and a new name enters the canon: Vidar Våer of Ildjarn, formerly of Thou Shalt Suffer (also connected to Emperor), and his 1992 black metal/dungeon synth demo tape ""Unknown Truths"". In March 1992, roughly a year-and-a-half before his murder, Euronymous published the Burzum self-titled debut album through his record label Deathlike Silence Productions, marking the first time a prominent member of the 2nd wave of black metal released material combining black metal tracks with ambient, synth-driven tracks and industrial-esque atmospheric tracks on the same record. This is also the first known use of the word ""dungeon"" on a record that would later be cited as proto-dungeon synth.

1993
By 1993, dungeon synth as a style of black metal separate from the traditional instrumentation of black metal would become visibly apparent with the beginnings of Mortiis' ""Era 1"" material. Ellefsen, after his departure from Emperor, purchased a Roland keyboard and created the first Mortiis demo: The Song Of A Long Forgotten Ghost. This first demo, clocking in at just under an hour in length, marked the first time a black metal musician would publish a work that ""looked"" like a typical black metal demo tape but contained entirely instrumental and non-traditional black metal instrumentation. The first iteration of this demo, self-released by Ellefsen, was circulated in an unknown number of copies on consumer-grade cassettes with a Xerox copied insert; a do it yourself practice typical of black metal and other genres of underground music.
The second iteration of this demo tape would be the first time Ellefsen would use the phrase ""dark dungeon music"" to refer to this burgeoning style of dark ambient music.
Also in 1993, and worthy of mention, is the short-lived Danish project Dark Funeral (not to be confused with the Swedish band of the same name). This demo is occasionally invoked alongside Mortiis' earliest works as another example of nascent dungeon synth but the project quickly ended after releasing two demos.
Again, in 1993, Jim Kirkwood would publish two more works which would retroactively be touted as influencing early dungeon synth music: Through A Dark Glass and Tower of Darkness. Though each work can only tenuously be called dungeon synth, Kirkwood's overall influence is indelible when considering the prevalence of the Berlin School on dungeon synth, overall.

1994
1994 saw the publication of several albums, E.P.s, and demos now considered canon in dungeon synth; of particular merit is the seminal work Født til å Herske, Pazuzu's ...And All Was Silent (featuring both Richard Lederer and Michael Gregor later of Summoning), Tears of the Weeping Willow and Lost Woods by Cernunnos Woods, and several others including Lamentation, Black Wailing, Erevos, Equitant, Asmorod, Landscape, and Wintergods.

Earthstar (band),"Earthstar is an electronic music group from Utica, New York. Earthstar was encouraged by Krautrock/Kosmische Musik/electronic music artist, composer, and producer Klaus Schulze to relocate to Germany where they contracted with Sky Records.  Schulze inspired and produced their second album, French Skyline.  Earthstar is notable as the only American band who participated in Germany's Kosmische Musik/electronic music scene while still at its height.
The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock describes Earthstar as a “wall of sound.” Wuest's vision and compositions propel the band along with composers Dennis Rea and Daniel Zongrone. The composed music doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument but rather creates a sound texture. There are credits for traditional musical instruments including sitar and vocals that may be difficult to distinguish.   Earthstar's style on French Skyline has been compared to Wolfgang Bock, Sangiuliano, and Klaus Schulze's own recordings.  Other albums have a softer style with more distinct instrumentation.
Earthstar is also notable for Craig Wuest's heavy use of the Mellotron and the rare Birotron, a variation on the Mellotron that can sustain notes beyond eight seconds.

History
1977–1979 (Utica and Moontower)
Earthstar was the brainchild of keyboardist/synthesist Craig Wuest. A native of Utica, New York, Wuest was heavily influenced by the German electronic music scene of the 1970s, including Klaus Schulze, Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, and Harmonia.  Around the same time, Utica guitarist Dennis Rea had founded what he describes as an ""eccentric progressive rock band,"" Zuir.  According to Rea, ""...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable.""
Rea also recalls concerts during the Utica period: ""The group performed live only a handful of times, mostly at inappropriate venues like roadhouse bars and college beer halls, with predictable results.""

1979–1983 (Germany and Sky)
Craig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer Klaus Schulze, with whom he struck up a correspondence.  Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his Innovative Communications record label.  Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on Salterbarty Tales, to finance the move.
While much of French Skyline was recorded at Klaus Schulze studios in Hambühren, West Germany, with additional recording taking place at IC Studios in Ovelgönne, Schulze's label never signed Earthstar. The group's next three albums were released by Hamburg-based Sky Records instead, beginning with French Skyline in 1979, which was co-produced by Schulze and Wuest.  Schulze's influence on Earthstar and Wuest is clearly heard on French Skyline, with reviewer Victor ""Philip"" Parau describing Earthstar at the time as ""granted a classic place"" within ""the Berlin School electronic sessions.""
Earthstar's second album for Sky, Atomkraft? Nein, Danke! (literally ""Nuclear power?  No, thank you!""), was an environmental tone poem.  The album was recorded in 1979 and 1980 and was released on February 1, 1981.  The Planet Mellotron Web site describes it as ""more laid back"" than French Skyline and ""...an ideal opportunity to hear the rarest tape-replay instrument,"" the Birotron.
A third album for Sky, Humans Only, was recorded in 1981 and released the following year.  The album was the result of a partnership between Wuest and Utica-based guitarist and songwriter Dan Hapanowicz.

Later works?
According to Dennis Rea, Earthstar dissolved not long after the release of Humans Only.  A now defunct earthstarmusic.com Web site listed three later releases. Axiom, which was listed as following Humans Only, was recorded in Germany in 1980 and the United States in 1984.   MP3 samples of the music revealed a conventional, melodic, controlled electronic music sound.  By this point Earthstar had become Wuest's solo project, as indicated in the description of the album Big Blue Piano.  The website listed both Big Blue Piano and a collection of unreleased material called Eve as having been released by Electronic America Records in 2000. However, no record of the actual release of these later works can be found.
After the Earthstar sessions guitarist Dennis Rea moved to Seattle  where he met electronic composer Kerry Leimer, who had released a number of albums.  Leimer, looking to create danceable electronic music, had formed Savant.: 17–19   Rea joined Savant in 1982, contributing to the album The Neo-Realist (at Risk), described by Downbeat magazine as ""pan-ethnic techno-dub music"".: 18–19 
In 1983 Rea moved to New York City where he once again worked with former Earthstar member Daniel Zongrone.  The pair composed music for an exhibition of painter (and former Earthstar violinist) Daryl Trivieri's work at the Semaphore East Gallery in the East Village in 1985.  Rea returned to Seattle in 1986 where he is the sole former Earthstar member still actively recording music.  Zongrone recorded a solo album, Absolute Zero, in 1987 and composed the music for the 1998 film The Glasshead.  He is currently artist in residence, composing, recording and working with longtime colleague Dennis Rea.
Sky Records did include Earthstar tracks on both volumes of their Schwingungen - New Age Music compilations in 1985 and 1986.
In 2023, Made In Germany Music acquired the rights to the Earthstar catalog and released the 5-CD set Collected Works, compiling all four studio albums for Moontower and Sky Records as well as the previously-unreleased album Sleeper The Nightlifer.

Edgar Froese,"Edgar Willmar Froese (German: [ˈɛtɡaʁ ˈfʁøːzə]; 6 June 1944 – 20 January 2015) was a German musical artist and electronic music pioneer, best known for founding the electronic music group Tangerine Dream in 1967. Froese was the only continuous member of the group until his death. His solo and group recordings prior to 2003 name him as ""Edgar Froese"", and his later solo albums bear the name ""Edgar W. Froese"".

Biography
Froese was born in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Russia), on D-Day during World War II; members of his family, including his father, had been killed by the Nazis and after the war his mother and surviving family settled in Berlin. He took piano lessons from the age of 12, and started playing guitar at 15. After showing an early aptitude for art, Froese enrolled at the Academy of the Arts in Berlin to study painting and sculpture.
One of his most lucrative jobs was to design advertising posters for the Berlin buses. He started an evening degree in Psychology and Philosophy and received his doctorate on Kant's categorical imperative. Since his interpretation was not in accordance with the academic way of thinking, he left the college with the remark: ""The dust of the universities is like a shroud over the truth.""
In 1965 he formed a band called The Ones, who played psychedelic rock, and some rock R&B standards. While playing in Spain, The Ones were invited to perform at Salvador Dalí's villa in Cadaqués. Froese's encounter with Dalí was highly influential, inspiring him to pursue more experimental directions with his music. The Ones disbanded in 1967, having released only one single ""Lady Greengrass"" (b/w ""Love of Mine"") on Star-Club Records. After returning to Berlin, Froese began recruiting musicians for the free-rock band that would become Tangerine Dream.

Personal life
Froese declared himself to be vegetarian, teetotal, and a non-smoker; he also did not take drugs. Froese was married to artist and photographer Monika (Monique) Froese from 1974 until her death in 2000. Their son Jerome Froese was a member of Tangerine Dream from 1990 through 2006. In 2002, Edgar Froese married artist and musician Bianca Froese-Acquaye.
Froese was a friend of such artists as David Bowie, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop, George Moorse, Volker Schlöndorff, Alexander Hacke and Friedrich Gulda. Pop and Bowie lived with Froese and his family at their home in Schöneberg before moving to their apartment on Hauptstraße. Froese also helped Bowie with his recovery from drugs and introduced him to the Berlin underground scene. Bowie named Froese's solo album Epsilon in Malaysian Pale as a big influence and a soundtrack to his life in Berlin.
Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. He was posthumously awarded the Schallwelle Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2015. He was quoted by the BBC as having once said: ""there is no death, there is just a change of our cosmic address"".

Other appearances
Edgar Froese solo material as Tangerine Dream
Tangents was a Tangerine Dream compilation album box set of five CDs issued in 1994, compiling music from their years with Virgin Records, 1973 to 1983.  Disc five consists entirely of ""previously unreleased material"": ten tracks, seven of which are credited only to Froese as the composer.  No information is given as to where or when these tracks were recorded, or by which line-up of Tangerine Dream.  Most Tangerine Dream tracks credit the line-up that recorded it as the composers, therefore these appear to be Froese solo tracks, released under the Tangerine Dream name, and may have been recorded for this album.  Furthermore, five tracks on disc three are described as ""re-recordings by Edgar Froese"", while the remaining tracks on discs three and four are described as ""re-mixed plus additional recordings by Edgar Froese"".  The tracks on discs one and two are also remixed and contain new overdubs, and Froese is credited as producer for the entire album.
Another compilation box set, the 6-CD I-Box (2001) contains further bonus tracks credited only to Froese: ""Ivory Town"", ""Storm Seekers"", ""Cool Shibuya"" and ""Akash Deep"". Several of Froese's tracks from Tangents are included as well.
The Tangerine Dream album Views from a Red Train (2008) was originally announced as an Edgar Froese solo album. It was eventually expanded with other band members performing, but the album remains composed entirely by Froese.

Eloy Fritsch,"Eloy Fernando Fritsch (born 1968) is an electronic musician, keyboard player and main composer of Brazilian progressive rock band Apocalypse. As a solo artist he creates cosmic new-age music.

History
In 1983 Fritsch formed progressive rock band Apocalypse. They are considered pivotal in the development of progressive rock in Southern Brazil.
In 1992, he moved to Porto Alegre and began his solo project composing electronic music. His first official solo album was Dreams, recorded in 1994 and 1995. During 1997, he released his second solo album, Behind the Walls of Imagination, which showcases his skills with various electronic and acoustic keyboard instruments. In the mid-1990s, Fritsch secured a recording contract with French label Musea. His third album for them, Space Music, was released in 1998.
The composer reveals his sci-fi style with Cyberspace. In this album Fritsch offers 1970s-inspired keyboard symphonic/electronic progressive instrumental music. Fritsch performs electronic music that evolves between Vangelis' ambient and impressionist electronic, and the synthesized progressive rock of masters such as Rick Wakeman. Nevertheless, Fritsch has found his own style within melodic electronic music framework. The compositions are very melodic and emotive, with multi-layered instrumental textures/voicings and solidly coherent arrangements.
Fritsch has earned a PhD in computer music, and has served as a teacher of electronic music at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). During 1999, Fritsch created the Electronic Music Center in the Institute of Arts at UFRGS.
In parallel with his work as keyboard player of the group Apocalypse and his academic activity, Fritsch releases music as a solo musician (through the Musea and Rock Symphony labels), such as the album Mythology, a large variety of original musical works in which he brings to maturity the use of synthesizers to compose melodic electronic music. This ambitious work uses the whole panel of his electronic sounds to depict fifteen tracks exclusively dedicated to the different gods worshiped in the past. Different cultures, such as Brazilian, Mesopotamian, Hindu, Amerindian, Inca, African, Greek, Egyptian, Scandinavian, Roman and Chinese, are outlined in the Mythology album by an instrumental composition, thanks to his panoply of keyboards including a Roland System 700 modular synthesizer.
Eloy Fritsch's love of the sky inspired him to compose the electronic suite Atmosphere (2003). Once again the composer reveals his ecological convictions: he presently defends the virtues of the gas envelope that allow everyone to live on Earth: the Atmosphere.
Landscapes (2005) was Fritsch's next work to emerge on disc.
In 2007 Eloy Fritsch wrote the book ""Electronic Music"" that was released in 2008 during the Book Fair in Porto Alegre. The book is accompanied by a DVD containing the electroacoustic compositions Synapse 5.1, Synthetic Horizon, Public Market, Indian Sampler, Mystery and Silicon Child created during his research in Electronic Music Center at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Eloy Fritsch received the Açorianos Music Awards. The awards ceremony happened on 28 April 2008, Tuesday night at the São Pedro Theater, Porto Alegre, Brazil. The Açorianos Music Awards honor the best albums, musicians and contributions to the music in South o Brazil. The ceremony was broadcast on television and event production presented a short film about the music and artistic works of the composer.
In 2009 Eloy Fritsch played keyboards in several concerts with the Apocalypse. He also released the album The Garden of Emotions. Musea company distributed the CD in Europe. The recorded company wrote the following lines about the album: ""The ninth album The Garden of Emotions presents symphonic themes with choirs, analog and digital synthesizers dominating. Fans of classic VANGELIS, Jean-Michel JARRE and Rick WAKEMAN works will enjoy this. Some of the more solemn themes remind Isao TOMITA. ""Lumine Solis"" is one of the best compositions and a choir-laden track. ""Solar Energy"" introduces a spacier atmosphere, with phasing pads and Berlin School sequences. This is pure electronic music and a very good one, with all sorts of really fat analog timbres. ""Beyond The Mountains"" is a very cinematic and return to the classically inspired structures, with an extra ethnic elements. ""Electric Light"" is synthetic and even KRAFTWERK-like, with insisting sequences, vocoders and a simple repeating melodic theme. Flutes, marimba sound and percussion welcome the coming of ""Savage"" before a melodic synthesizers theme appears. ""Space Station"" is another foray into a purely synthetic world and you could also draw a comparison with Jean-Michel JARRE's ""Chronologie"". ""The Canyon of Hope"" finishes this album with flowing synthesizers, symphonic textures and a reflective electric piano"".
In the same year Fritsch was also honored on the Journey of Literature event in the Passo Fundo city, Brazil. The composer received the trophy Vasco Prado.
In 2010 Fritsch worked on two major projects: In the production of The Apocalypse 25th Anniversary Box Set (2 CDs, 1 DVD and the book about the Apocalypse Hystory) and the MCT Project – Music, Science and Technology funded by the Brazilian government. Fritsch has created the Brazilian Virtual Museum of Synthesizer and a documentary film about electronic music to be distributed to schools and music teachers. He also created an exhibition of electronic music at the museum of the university.

Eluvium (musician),"Eluvium is the moniker of the American ambient recording artist Matthew Cooper, who resides in Portland, Oregon. Cooper was born in Tennessee and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, before relocating to the Northwest. His albums often feature artwork and photographs by Jeannie Paske. He is signed to the record label Temporary Residence Limited.

Matthew Robert Cooper and Miniatures
In April 2008, Cooper announced he would release a ""solo album"" under the name Matthew Robert Cooper. Writing on the Temporary Residence message boards, Cooper explained the change ""this is not far from something ""eluvium"" would release—but since I began writing them—I felt that they were somehow disconnected from eluvium—perhaps a different personality took shape—thus, the use of a different name - this work is very dear to me.""
Miniatures was issued in 2008 on a limited vinyl release on the fledgling Portland label, Gaarden Records. The album was limited to 2,000 copies with the first 1,000 on colored vinyl.

Other projects
Cooper has also teamed up with Charles Buckingham, with whom he has worked on the ambient video project titled Window Exchange, to produce the ""unedited improvised basement minidisc recordings"" of Concert Silence. In the fall of 2007, Concert Silence made 09.22.07 [2-3pm], a 51-minute, six part instrumental piece.
In April 2010, Infraction Records released ""09.22.07 [2-3pm]"" on limited edition vinyl and compact disc, alongside a new 12"" E.P./CD titled ""Rain Furniture"".
Cooper scored fellow Portlander Matt McCormick's feature film debut Some Days Are Better Than Others, under Temporary Residence Ltd. One of Cooper's original pieces can be heard in the trailer of the film. Another film scored by Cooper is For Thousands of Miles (2013) by Mike Ambs.
Cooper has released an Eluvium 10"" vinyl named ""Pedals / Petals"" in January 2013, for the Vinyl Films project by film director Cameron Crowe.
In January 2014, Pitchfork reported that Cooper and Mark T. Smith of Explosions in the Sky teamed up to form a new act called Inventions, who released their first album, a self-titled, on April 1 through Temporary Residence. In September 2016, he released the album False Readings On.

Enigma (German band),"Enigma is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a new-age, worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, MCMXC a.D. (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's most successful, helped by the international hit single ""Sadeness (Part I)"", which sold twelve million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey ""the old rules and habits"" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.
Enigma followed MCMXC a.D. with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over eight million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! (1996), which blended the Gregorian chants reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album The Screen Behind the Mirror (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and A Posteriori (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives Many Faces (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was released in November 2016.
Enigma has sold over 8.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and an estimated 70 million worldwide with over 100 gold and platinum certifications. The project has also received two Grammy Award nominations.

History
Formation
By the late 1980s, Romanian-born German musician and producer Michael Cretu had collaborated with several musicians, produced albums recorded by his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, and released solo albums under his name for Polydor and Virgin Records, to varying levels of commercial success across Europe. In 1988, Cretu and Sandra married and relocated to the Spanish island of Ibiza. A home recording studio, A.R.T. Studios, was built, and Cretu began work on a new, worldbeat and new-age musical project named Enigma with David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. Cretu secured a deal with Munich-based Mambo Musik to handle Enigma's management and publishing.

1990s
The first Enigma album, MCMXC a.D., was recorded in eight months and incorporated Gregorian chants mixed with atmospheric music and dance beats. He had previously used a Gregorian-type chant on the opening seconds of Sandra's 1987 single ""Everlasting Love"". Cretu wished to exclude his name from the album's liner notes so the listener could conjure their own interpretations. He recalled management ""fell off their chairs"" when he requested it, ""but it worked"". Cretu credits himself as ""Curly M.C."" and Peterson is listed as ""F. Gregorian"". Upon its release in December 1990, MCMXC a.D. became an unexpected commercial success, helped by the international hit single ""Sadeness (Part I)"", released a month prior that reached number one in 24 countries. The album reached the top 10 in ten countries, including the United Kingdom, and number six on the Billboard 200 in the United States, where it sold over four million copies and charted for more than 150 weeks. The album earned over 50 platinum sales awards worldwide, and made Enigma the most successful act signed to Virgin at the time of release.
Following the success of MCMXC a.D., Cretu received many offers for soundtrack work and writing film scores. He turned the majority of them down as he disliked the scripts presented to him except for the erotic thriller film Sliver (1993), for which he produced two songs for its soundtrack: ""Carly's Song"" and ""Carly's Loneliness"". The former was reworked into ""Age of Loneliness"" in 1993. Cretu was unable to contribute more to the soundtrack as he wished to spend his time working on the second Enigma album.
The Cross of Changes was recorded in 1993. The long period in between the first and second was partly down to Virgin and Cretu's manager forgetting to extend his contract with Virgin. This led to Cretu signing a new, five-album deal. Cretu retained many of the elements from the first album, but ""wanted to have a completely different experience. I wanted to mix as much as possible rock elements and ethnic and classical"". Numerous samples were used, including from songs by Genesis, Black Sabbath, Vangelis and U2. Cretu made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of Gregorian chants incorporated into the album. Cretu based much of its lyrics on the concepts behind numerology, and read books on the subject. The Cross of Changes was released in December 1993, and reached number one in the UK and number 9 in the US. Four singles were released in 1994: ""Return to Innocence"", ""The Eyes of Truth"", ""Age of Loneliness"" and ""Out from the Deep"". The former became an international top-10 hit in twelve countries and is certified gold in the US for selling half a million copies. The Cross of Changes sold an estimated 8 million copies worldwide.
In 1996, Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! was released. Cretu's idea was that this third album was the child of the previous two albums, and therefore included familiar elements of Gregorian chants and Sanskrit chants in it. It did not achieve the same level of success that they enjoyed previously, and as a result, only two of the three singles originally slated were released. Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! sold over one million units in the United States, achieved a Gold certificate in the United Kingdom and two Grammy nominations: one for its artwork design and the second as Best New Age Album. After the album's release, Cretu found that several fake Enigma albums were released onto the market that Cretu deemed as ""awful messes"".

2000s
The 2000 release of The Screen Behind the Mirror included samples from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana on four tracks on the album. This time the Gregorian chants were toned down tremendously, although Shakuhachi flutes and other traditional Enigma signatures remain. Only ""Gravity of Love"" and ""Push the Limits"" were released as singles from the album. Ruth-Ann Boyle (from the band Olive) and Andru Donalds mark their first appearances on the Enigma project.
In 2001, Cretu released a new single called ""Turn Around"" together with Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits and Love Sensuality Devotion: The Remix Collection to end what he considers to be the first chapter of Enigma. A light show was held at the Munich Planetarium in conjunction with the release of the compilation albums.
2003's Voyageur saw a change of direction for the project, with most of the prominent Enigma signature elements (the ethnic and Gregorian chants, the Shakuhachi flutes) no longer employed.
To commemorate the fifteen years of Enigma, a limited-edition album called 15 Years After was launched, which was the size of an LP vinyl disk, with Leonardo da Vinci's art in the cover, a big booklet with extra art, and featured eight compact discs: all the previous albums, the DVD Remember the Future, and a special and exclusive bonus CD, The Dusted Variations, which included chill-out versions of several of the project's greatest hits. All of the songs are different from the originals and use minimal percussion. This disc also contained the single version of ""Hello and Welcome"", which was later released as a single. On 28 August 2005, Enigma's management Crocodile Music announced the release of ""Hello and Welcome"" as a single. It was released in Germany on 10 March 2006.
On 26 September 2006, Enigma's sixth album A Posteriori was released worldwide, containing a new version of ""Hello and Welcome"" and the new song ""Goodbye, Milky Way"". A DVD version of A Posteriori was released on 16 December 2006, which featured kaleidoscope images in synchronization with the multi-channel remastered music. A Posteriori received a Grammy nomination as Best New Age Album, its second in that category following 1996's Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! nomination. In late March 2007, a Private Lounge remix album version of A Posteriori was released on the iTunes Music Store. This compilation includes twelve new remixed tracks from the album by artists such as Boca Junior, Tocadisco and more. Some of these tracks were available previously on the original A Posteriori iTunes version of the album and the previously mentioned DVD release.
On 19 September 2008, Enigma's seventh album Seven Lives Many Faces was released worldwide. The lead single, ""Seven Lives"", is a fusion of modern and classical elements.
The Platinum Collection, a three-disc compilation, was released on 27 November 2009 in Germany, and on 9 February 2010 worldwide. The first CD contains Enigma hits. The second CD contains remixes. The third CD is a collection of ""lost tracks"", musical experiments which never were finalized and released previously.

2010s–present
On 5 October 2010, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first album MCMXC a.D., the ""Enigma's Social Song"" project began. Enigma fans were asked to submit vocals for a new Enigma song. The public was then asked to vote, with the winning submission ""Fei mea"" being provided by Latvian singer Fox Lima (real name Alise Ketnere) for the chorus. The top three runners-up, Mark Joshua from Brazil, J. Spring from Spain, and Rasa Serra from Lithuania, provided other important parts of the vocals like the bridge, backing and verse of the final version of the single. Fans also influenced further stages of the song's creation by voting on elements such as a lead instrument, general mood, and style of the track. The final mix of the single named ""MMX (The Social Song)"" was released on 15 December 2010. It became the first song ever created for and by the fans via the internet.
In August 2016, Enigma's eighth studio album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was announced for a release on 11 November 2016. It features guest musicians Brazilian singer-songwriter Mark Josher, Indonesian singer Anggun, female voice Nanuk, and English electro-pop duo Aquilo. Two singles from the album have been released, ""Sadeness (Part II)"" featuring Anggun, and ""Amen"" featuring Aquilo.
In May 2018, limited-edition coloured vinyl editions of Enigma's entire catalogue were released in a new collection, The Colours of Enigma – The Vinyl Series. The set features new artwork and remastered stereo mixes made from the original master tapes.
Throughout 2019 and into 2020, three former vocalists for Enigma—Andru Donalds, Angel X and Fox Lima—embarked on a world tour under the name Original Enigma Voices. This marks the first time Enigma's music has been performed live.

Recording technologies
Cretu recorded the first five Enigma albums at A.R.T. Studios, a home recording studio located on the Spanish island of Ibiza. From 1988 until 2001, Cretu lived in Santa Eulària des Riu followed by, from 2001 to 2008, a villa near Sant Antoni where the studio was redesigned and built by Gunter Wagner and Bernd Steber. A Posteriori and Seven Lives Many Faces were recorded using an all-in-one mobile digital recording studio named Alchemist. In 2010, a reworked version of Alchemist was built and named Merlin. ""MMX The Social Song"" was the first Enigma release recorded with this model.

Sampling and lawsuits
In 1991, Cretu was sued by Munich-based choir Capella Antiqua and its record label Polydor Germany for infringing its ""right of personality"" through distortion in the samples used in ""Sadeness (Part I)"" and ""Mea Culpa (Part II)"". The samples were taken from Capella Antiqua's 1976 LP Paschale Mysterium; while the musical compositions were in the public domain, Capella Antiqua's recording of them was copyrighted. European law also recognizes moral rights (droit moral) in works.
In 1998, Cretu was sued by Taiwanese musicians Difang and Igay Duana (also known as Kuo Ying-nan and Kuo Hsiu-chu), whose voices are used in ""Return to Innocence"", over the unauthorized usage of their song without credit. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and all further releases of the song were credited (including royalties) to the Kuos. Cretu has stated that he had been led to believe that the recording was in the public domain and that he did not intentionally violate the Kuos' copyright.

Musical style
Enigma generally produces worldbeat and New-age songs. The musical project is very experimental, often combining elements from other genres like ambience, pop, or rock. Michael Cretu has said in an Q&A that he is ""always looking for the unknown and I am trying to find new ways to express my ideas."" He later said: Enigma is all about reaching the limit and even moving forward from the already known. Experiments are a big part of my work and with every record Enigma has released there is something new.
Enigma's first album, MCMXC a.D., combines Gregorian chants and religious overtones with atmospheric synths, a hypnotic music-set, and a dance-like beat, along with elements of pop and ambience all accompanied by French-like whispers and somewhat erotic gasps, provided by Sandra. The Cross of Changes, Enigma's second album, replaces the Gregorian chants from the MCMXC a.D. with ethnic and tribal chanting. The album is atmospheric and spiritual like MCMXC a.D., but is combined with more well-developed beats and lyrics about love and self-awareness.

Legacy
Enigma's international success with MCMXC a.D. was a precursor to the creation of several other musical projects that follow similar styles and marketing approaches, especially the use of the term ""project"" as opposed to the band to denominate themselves, and the label ""enigmatic music"", employed mainly by radios and listeners, to categorize their music inside the new-age umbrella. Cretu has cited the progressive rock band Yes as an influence.
Soon after working with Michael Cretu on the first Enigma album, German producer Frank Peterson left the project to focus on Gregorian, a band that performs mostly covers of modern pop and rock songs with Gregorian-like vocals and symphonic instruments. Likewise, French musical project Era features Gregorian chants mixed with pop-rock arrangements and is also frequently compared in scope to Enigma.
More electronic projects that often draw comparisons with Enigma are French act Deep Forest, Canadian duo Delerium, Danish project Achillea (created by Enigma's co-producer and guest guitarist Jens Gad) and German project Schiller.

Enya,"Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin (born 17 May 1961), known mononymously as Enya, is an Irish singer-songwriter.  As the second-best-selling Irish musical act overall, after the rock band U2, Enya is the best-selling Irish solo artist, with an estimated 80 million albums sold worldwide. Her music has been widely recognised for featuring multi-layers of her vocals, varied instrumentation, lengthened reverb, and interwoven elements of Celtic music.
Enya was raised in the Irish-speaking region of Gweedore. In 1980, Enya (as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin) began her musical career playing alongside her family's Irish folk band Clannad. She left Clannad in 1982 to pursue a solo career, working with the former Clannad manager and producer, Nicky Ryan, and his partner Roma, as their lyricist. Over the following four years, Enya developed her sound by combining multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements from a variety of musical genres such as Celtic, classical, church, jazz, ambient, world, hip-hop and Irish folk.
The earliest releases by Enya as a solo artist were two instrumentals for the Touch Travel T4 cassette compilation (1984) composed around 1982–83. The majority of the soundtrack for The Frog Prince (1985) was composed by Enya, and she sang two songs with lyrics, however these were not heard in-film. Enya composed a body of work for the 1986 BBC documentary series named The Celts. A selection of her pieces for The Celts were released as her debut album, Enya (1987). Former chairman of Warner Music, Rob Dickins found himself enjoying the music from The Celts. He happened to meet the trio, expressed his interest in Enya's music, and so she agreed to sign with Warner Music UK. The initial record deal granted her considerable artistic freedom and minimal interference. The success of Watermark (1988) propelled Enya to worldwide fame, helped mostly by the international hit single ""Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)"". This was followed by the multi-million-selling albums Shepherd Moons (1991), The Memory of Trees (1995), and A Day Without Rain (2000). Sales of A Day Without Rain and its lead single, ""Only Time"", surged in the United States following its use in media coverage of the 9/11 attacks. After Amarantine (2005) and And Winter Came... (2008), Enya took a four-year break from music, returning to the recording studio in 2012 to begin work on her eighth studio album Dark Sky Island (2015).
Regarding a new album, there have been several mentions by close sources of Enya, particularly her siblings, about Enya recording new music since her 2015 album. According to her sister Moya, Enya was recording music as of 2019. Enya's latest statement in-print, from the vinyl release of A Box of Dreams in June 2023: ""Beidh muid ag teacht le chéile gan mhoile"", is approximated as ""we will meet again soon"".

Early life
Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin was born in the Dore area of Gaoth Dobhair (Gweedore) in County Donegal on 17 May 1961. She is the sixth of nine children in the Brennan family of musicians, born to Máire ""Baba"" and Leopold ""Leo"" Brennan. In 1968, the couple took ownership of a pub in Meenaleck, Co. Donegal, naming it Leo's Tavern. Leo Brennan (1925–2016) was the leader of an Irish showband named the Slieve Foy Band, before performing solo. Baba Brennan (née Duggan; born 1930) has remote Spanish roots with ancestors who settled on Tory Island and she was an amateur musician who played with the Slieve Foy Band. Enya's mother also taught music at Gweedore Community School.

Gweedore is a Gaeltacht region, where the Irish langauge, which Enya and family refer to as Gaelic, is primarily spoken. Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin, her name, is anglicised as Enya Patricia Brennan, with ""Enya"" being the phonetic spelling of how ""Eithne"" is pronounced in the Donegal Ulster dialect. ""Ní Bhraonáin"" translates to ""daughter of Brennan"".
The name Brennan was accidentally added to Leo's name at his birth registration in 1925; his family name was Hardin; Leo used Brennan (Bhraonáin) for his children's surname. Harry Hardin was a pianist, and he passed away performing on stage. Enya's paternal grandmother, Minna Lenehan, played the drums. They were both believed to have been born in England. Regarding Baba's parents, Enya's maternal grandfather, Aodh, affectionately addressed as ""Gog"", was the headmaster of the primary school in Dore; her grandmother, Máire Gillespie, was a teacher. Aodh was also the founder of the Aisteoiri Ghaodobhair, the Gweedore Theatre company.
Enya has described her upbringing as ""very quiet and happy"" and expressed that "" it was difficult to be heard, but I was very comfortable with that because I was able to be myself, able to be let alone.” However, she has acknowledged that there was ""continual hustle and bustle and crying and chaos"" amongst the nine siblings. Their maternal grandparents were quite involved with the siblings' upbringing at home, as their parents were travelling with the showband; Leo entertaining at the pub, and Baba leading the choir.
Along with the siblings' enjoyment of their childhood spent in Gweedore, they also grew up amidst The Troubles. Enya recalls that when her family visited shops in Derry for instance, ""you’d be checked by people standing with guns”, and even speaking in Irish in Derry was ""pinpointing where you came from, and it was too political at the time. Whereas for us [Enya and family] it was our first language, and we didn’t see anything wrong with it.”
At three-and-a-half years of age, Enya took part in her first singing competition at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival. She also participated in pantomimes at Gweedore Theatre and sang with her siblings in their mother's choir at St Mary's church in Derrybeg. At the age of four, Enya began piano lessons and was learning English throughout primary school. She later said, ""I had to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I remember my brothers and sisters playing outside and I would be inside playing the piano, this one big book of scales, practising them over and over.""
As well as traditional Irish music, Enya and her siblings were introduced to a variety of music in the 1960s and 70s, and enjoyed watching musical films. In a radio interview with Elaine Page in November 2008, Enya shared a selection of favourite songs from musicals. She said of Jesus Christ Superstar, ""it was such an original piece of music in 1970 [...] played in my house every single day, and myself and my sisters would sing word for word"".
From the age of 11, Enya attended a convent boarding school in Milford, Milford College,  run by the Sisters of Loreto; Enya's education there was paid for by her grandfather. The boarding school, now Loreto Community School, was where Enya developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin, and watercolour painting. She said, ""It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family but it was good for my music."" Enya finished boarding school at age 17 in the late 1970s, and she spent a year at college studying classical music. She previously saw herself as teaching the piano, like both her mother and grandmother, rather than composing and performing her own music.

Career
1980–1982: Clannad
In 1970, several members of Enya's family formed Clannad, a Celtic folk band. Clannad hired Nicky Ryan as their manager, sound engineer, and producer, and Ryan's future wife, Roma Shane, as tour manager and administrator. In 1980, after a year at college, Enya decided not to pursue a music degree and instead accepted Ryan's invitation to join Clannad, having wanted to expand their sound with keyboards and an additional vocalist. Enya performed an uncredited role on their sixth studio album, Crann Úll (1980), with a line-up of elder siblings Moya, Pól, and Ciarán Brennan, and twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Duggan. She features in their follow-up, Fuaim (1981), singing the song ""An Túll"" (The Apple).Ciarán mentioned that Enya was a ""hired hand"" and not a full member, commenting that ""she was 18, 19 and we were paying her £500 sterling a week."" In a BBC Radio Ulster interview with Moya in late 2023, she also noted that Enya was considered a hired hand with Clannad. Nicky Ryan said it was not his intention to make Enya a permanent member, as she was ""fiercely independent [...] intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it."" Nicky discussed the idea of layering vocals to create a ""choir of one"" with Enya, a concept inspired by Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique that had interested them both.
During a Clannad tour in 1982, Nicky called for a band meeting to address internal issues that had arisen, which he put down to the excessive drinking of one or two members. He recalled: ""It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing."" Enya chose to leave with the Ryans and pursue a solo career, having felt confined in the group and disliking being ""somebody in the background"". In an extended interview from 1989, Enya said that ""I wasn't composing it [the music], I was just there, you know."" The split caused some friction between the parties but, in time, they settled their differences. Enya's brother Ciarán also spoke to Nicky Ryan around 2006, interested in recording in their studio with her, but Ryan suggested that this was unlikely to occur. Moya often praises Enya for what she has gone on to achieve in her solo career, and supposes that there were some musical foundations that Enya had built from her short time with the band.

1982–1985: Early solo career
Nicky suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore ""with no particular definite future"", or live with him and Roma in suburban Artane, in Dublin, ""and see what happens, musically"", which Enya decided to try. After their bank denied them a loan, Enya sold her saxophone and gave piano lessons as a source of income. Nicky Ryan used what they could afford to build a recording facility in the Ryans' garden shed, which they named ""Aigle Studio"", after the French word for eagle. Enya lived with the Ryans from 1982, shortly after leaving Clannad, until 1989, when she bought a penthouse apartment in Killiney.
Enya and the Ryans rented Aigle Studio out to other musicians to help recoup the costs. The trio formed a musical and business partnership, with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma as her lyricist. They called their company, of which each owns a third, Aigle Music. In the following two years, Enya developed her technique and composition by listening to recordings of her reciting pieces of classical music and repeated this process until she started to improvise sections and develop her own arrangements.
In the early 1980s following her Clannad departure, Enya recorded with a few artists, often on keyboards or backing vocals, with Nicky Ryan as producer. She also played the synthesiser on the group Ragairne's Ceol Aduaidh, led by Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh and Frankie Kennedy. Being one of the earlier choices to sing the song before Maggie Reilly, Enya declined an offer from Mike Oldfield to sing on his single ""Moonlight Shadow"", likely due to existing contracts. ""Bailieboro and Me"" is a Charlie McGettigan song with the group Jargon; an early recording features Enya singing backing vocals, primarily credited as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin playing the grand piano for the song.
Enya's first solo endeavour was in 1982, when she composed and later released two piano instrumentals, ""An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian"" (Irish for ""The Solar Wind"") and ""Miss Clare Remembers"". Both were recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin and released on Touch Travel (1984), a limited-release cassette compilation of music from various artists on the UK Touch label. She is credited as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin in the liner notes.
After several months of preparation, Enya's first live solo performance took place at the National Stadium in Dublin on 23 September 1983, and was televised for RTÉ's music show Festival Folk. Niall Morris, a musician who worked with her during this time, recalled she ""was so nervous she could barely get on stage, and she cowered behind the piano until the gig was over"". Morris assisted Enya in the production of a demo tape, adding additional keyboards to her compositions.
Roma thought the music would suit accompanying visuals and sent it to various film producers. Among them was David Puttnam, after Roma had read an interview where he stated a particular interest in strong melodies. Puttnam liked the tape and offered Enya to compose the soundtrack to his upcoming romantic comedy film, The Frog Prince (1984). Enya scored nine pieces for the film; later, against her wishes, the pieces were rearranged and orchestrated by Richard Myhill, except for two pieces in which she sang, ""The Frog Prince"" and ""Dreams"". The words to ""Dreams"" were penned by Charlie McGettigan. The film editor Jim Clark said the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to the picture.
Released in 1985, the album is the first commercial release that credits her as ""Enya"". She supposes that ""Enya"" for her began in 1983. Nicky Ryan suggested the phonetic spelling of her name, thinking that Eithne would be mispronounced by non-Irish speakers. Enya looked back at her composition work on the film as a good career move, but a disappointing one as ""we weren't part of it at the end"". Also in 1985, she sang on three tracks on Ordinary Man (1985) by Christy Moore.

1985–1989: The Celts and Watermark
In 1985, producer Tony McAuley asked Enya to contribute a track for the six-part BBC television documentary series The Celts. She had already written a Celtic-influenced song called ""March of the Celts"", and submitted it to the project. Each episode was to feature a different composer at first, but director David Richardson liked her track so much that he had Enya score the entire series. Enya recorded 72 minutes of music at Aigle Studio and the BBC studios in Wood Lane, London, without recording to the picture. She was required to portray certain themes and ideas that the producers wanted; however, in contrast with The Frog Prince, she worked with little interference, which granted her freedom to establish the sound that she would adopt throughout her future career, signified by layered vocals, keyboard-oriented music, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church, and folk music.
In March 1987, two months before The Celts aired, a 40-minute selection of Enya's score was released as her debut solo album, Enya, by BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. The latter promoted it with a new-age imprint on the packaging, which Nicky later thought was ""a cowardly thing for them to do"". The album gained enough public attention to reach number 8 on the Irish Albums Chart and number 69 on the UK Albums Chart. ""I Want Tomorrow"" was released as Enya's first single. ""Boadicea"" was later sampled by The Fugees on their 1996 song ""Ready or Not""; the group neither sought permission nor gave credit. Enya took legal action and the group subsequently gave her credit; they paid a fee of approximately $3 million. Later in 1987, Enya appeared on Sinéad O'Connor's debut album The Lion and the Cobra, reciting Psalm 91 in Irish on ""Never Get Old"".
Several weeks after the release of Enya, Enya secured a recording contract with Warner Music UK after Rob Dickins, the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to Enya and found himself playing it ""every night before I went to bed"". He later met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, where he learned that Enya had entered negotiations with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her, in doing so granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: ""Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was the latter... I just wanted to be involved with this music."" Enya left Atlantic and signed with the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle her American distribution.
When asked about whether women in pop have a hard time, she responded ""yes, they do. Definitely."" However, Enya has considered her position as a composer rather than just a vocalist to be an advantage ""because I write and perform much of the music, I'm taken more seriously than the girls who just walk into a studio, do a vocal and that's it. I can't even imagine what that would be like.""

With the green light to produce a new album, Enya recorded Watermark from June 1987 to April 1988. It was initially recorded in analogue at Aigle before Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London.
Watermark was released in September 1988 and became an unexpected hit, reaching number 5 in the United Kingdom and number 25 on the Billboard 200 in the United States following its release there in January 1989. Its lead single, ""Orinoco Flow"", was the last song written for the album. It was not intended to be a single at first, but Enya and the Ryans chose it after Dickins jokingly asked for a single; he knew that Enya's music was not made for the Top 40 chart. Dickins and engineer Ross Cullum are referenced in the song's lyrics. ""Orinoco Flow"" became an international top 10 hit and was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks. The new-found success propelled Enya to international fame and she received endorsement deals and offers to use her music in television commercials. She spent a year traveling worldwide to promote the album which increased her exposure through interviews, appearances, and live performances.

1989–1998: Shepherd Moons, The Memory of Trees and Paint the Sky with Stars
After promoting Watermark, Enya purchased new recording equipment and started work on her next album, Shepherd Moons. She found that the success of Watermark caused a considerable amount of pressure when it came to writing new songs, stating, ""I kept thinking, 'Would this have gone on Watermark? Is it as good?' Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right"".
Enya wrote songs based on several ideas, including entries from her diary, the Blitz in London, and her grandparents. Shepherd Moons was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than Watermark, reaching number one in the UK for one week and number 17 in the United States. ""Caribbean Blue"", its lead single, charted at number 13 in the United Kingdom.
In 1991, Warner Music released a collection of five Enya music videos as Moonshadows for home video. In 1993 Enya won her first Grammy Award in the Best New Age Album category for Shepherd Moons. Soon after, Enya and Nicky entered discussions with Industrial Light & Magic, founded by George Lucas, regarding an elaborate stage lighting system for a proposed concert tour, but nothing resulted from those discussions. In November 1992, Warner obtained the rights to Enya and re-released the album as The Celts with new artwork. It surpassed its initial sale performance, reaching number 10 in the UK.
After travelling worldwide to promote Shepherd Moons, Enya started to write and record her fourth album, The Memory of Trees.
By this time, the Ryans had moved to the southern Dublin suburb of Killiney, and a new Aigle Studio had been built alongside their home, with new recording facilities which eliminated the need to go to London to finish recording for the album. The new album was released in November 1995 and peaked at number 5 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it sold over 3 million copies. Its lead single, ""Anywhere Is"", reached number 7 in the UK. The second, ""On My Way Home"", reached number 26 in the UK. In late 1994, Enya put out an extended play of Christmas music titled The Christmas EP. Enya was offered the opportunity to compose the film score for Titanic but declined as it would be a collaboration, rather than solely her composition. A recording of her singing ""Oíche Chiúin"", an Irish-language version of ""Silent Night"", appeared on the charity album A Very Special Christmas 3, released in benefit of the Special Olympics in October 1997.
In early 1997, Enya began to select tracks for her first compilation album, ""trying to select the obvious ones, the hits, and others."" She chose to work on the collection following the promotional tour for The Memory of Trees as she felt it was the right time in her career, and that her contract with WEA required her to release a ""best of"" album. The set, named Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya, features two new tracks, ""Paint the Sky with Stars"" and ""Only If..."". Released in November 1997, the album was a worldwide commercial success, reaching number 4 in the UK and number 30 in the US, where it went on to sell over 4 million copies.
""Only If..."" was released as a single in 1997. Enya described the album as ""like a musical diary... each melody has a little story and I live through that whole story from the beginning... your mind goes back to that day and what you were thinking.""

1998–2007: A Day Without Rain and Amarantine
Enya started work on her fifth studio album, titled A Day Without Rain, in mid-1998. In a departure from her previous albums, she incorporated the use of a string section into her compositions, something that was not a conscious decision at first, but Enya and Nicky Ryan agreed that it complemented the songs that were being written. The album was released in November 2000 and reached number 6 in the UK and an initial peak of number 17 in the US.
In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, US sales of the album and its lead single ""Only Time"" surged after the song was widely used during radio and television coverage of the events, leading to its description as ""a post-September 11th anthem"". The exposure caused A Day Without Rain to outperform its original chart performance to peak at number 2 on the Billboard 200, and the release of a maxi-single containing the original and a pop remix of ""Only Time"" in November 2001. Enya donated its proceeds in aid of the International Association of Firefighters. The song topped the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and went to number 10 on the Hot 100 singles, Enya's highest charting US single to date.
In 2001, Enya agreed to write and perform on two tracks for the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) at the request of director Peter Jackson. Its composer Howard Shore ""imagined her voice"" as he wrote the film's score, making an uncommon exception to include another artist in one of his soundtracks. After flying to New Zealand to observe the filming and to watch a rough cut of the film, Enya returned to Ireland and composed ""Aníron"" (the theme for Aragorn and Arwen), with lyrics by Roma in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional Elvish language Sindarin, and ""May It Be"", sung in English and another Tolkien language, Quenya. Shore then based his orchestrations around Enya's recorded vocals and themes to create ""a seamless sound"".
In 2002, Enya released ""May It Be"" as a single which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. She performed the song live with an orchestra at the 74th Academy Awards ceremony in March 2002, and later cited the moment as a career highlight.
Enya undertook additional studio projects in 2001 and 2002. The first was work on the soundtrack of the Japanese romantic film Calmi Cuori Appassionati (2001), which was subsequently released as Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati (2001).
This release is formed of tracks spanning her career from Enya to A Day Without Rain with two B-sides. The album went to number 2 in Japan and became Enya's second album to sell one million copies in the country.
In 2004, Enya had another significant ""Boadicea"" sampling request from Diddy, for the song ""I Don't Wanna Know"" performed by Mario Winans. She said that the producer ""phoned the studio we were working in and Nicky took the call and he [Diddy] just said he had this fantastic singer that he was working with and it was Mario Winans. Immediately we said “send the song” and it was a great song.""
In September 2003, Enya returned to Aigle Studio to start work on her sixth studio album, Amarantine. Roma said the title means ""everlasting"". The album marks the first instance of Enya singing in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma that came about when Enya was working on ""Water Shows the Hidden Heart"". After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish, and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang ""Less Than a Pearl"" and ""The River Sings"" in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a ""culture and history"" behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are on another planet, questioning the existence of life outside of Earth. ""Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)"" is sung in Japanese. Amarantine was a global success, reaching number 6 on the Billboard 200 and number 8 in the UK. It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums. Enya dedicated the album to BBC producer Tony McAuley who had commissioned Enya to write the soundtrack to The Celts, following his death in 2003. The lead single, ""Amarantine"", was released in December 2005.

2008–2017: And Winter Came... and Dark Sky Island
Enya wrote music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, And Winter Came... Initially, she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns set for a release in late 2007 but decided to produce a winter-themed album instead.
The second promotional single of the album ""My! My! Time Flies!"", is a tribute to the late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner, incorporates a guitar solo performed by Pat Farrell, the first guitar solo on an Enya album since ""I Want Tomorrow"" from Enya. The lyrics also include some musical pop-culture references, such as The Beatles' famous photo shoot for the cover of Abbey Road, and ""a rap on a rhapsody"" possibly referring to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen. Upon its release in November 2008, And Winter Came... reached number 6 in the UK and number 8 in the US and sold almost 3.5 million copies worldwide by 2011.
After promoting And Winter Came..., Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks. Her second compilation album, The Very Best of Enya, was released in November 2009 and featured songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of ""Aníron"" and a DVD compiling most of her music videos to date.
In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, Dark Sky Island. Its name refers to the island of Sark, which became the first island to be designated a dark-sky preserve, and a series of poems on islands by Roma Ryan.
In 2013, ""Only Time"" was used in the ""Epic Split"" advertisement by Volvo Trucks starring Jean-Claude Van Damme who does the splits while suspended between two lorries.
Upon the album's release on 20 November 2015, Dark Sky Island went to number 4 in the UK, Enya's highest charting studio album there since Shepherd Moons went to number 1, and to number 8 in the US. A Deluxe Edition features three additional songs. Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK, Europe, the US, and Japan. During her visit to Japan, Enya performed ""Orinoco Flow"" and ""Echoes in Rain"" at the Universal Studios Japan Christmas show in Osaka. In December 2016, Enya appeared on the Irish television show Christmas Carols from Cork, marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years. She sang ""Adeste Fideles"", ""Oiche Chiúin"", and ""The Spirit of Christmas Past"".

2019–present; future project potential
Since late 2019 there has been a significant increase in activity from Enya's official social platforms online. There have been more official Enya posts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, updates to Enya tracks and playlists on Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music, as well as YouTube channel updates and new content. Several music videos on Enya's official YouTube channel have undergone 4K/HD conversion since 2020. Numerous YouTube ""watch party"" videos and vinyl re-releases marking anniversaries of Enya's music albums and compilations have been released since.
The first of these videos was in November 2020, posted on Enya's official YouTube channel to commemorate the 20th anniversary of A Day Without Rain. In addition to the individual tracks from the album, it included handwritten introductory messages from Enya and Roma Ryan, plus a closing message from Nicky Ryan. Some behind-the-scenes clips from the making of the music videos for ""Only Time"" and ""Wild Child"", both directed by Graham Fink, were also included.
For the Shepherd Moons 30th Anniversary Watch Party video in November 2021, Nicky Ryan's introductory message noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Aigle Studio underwent some renovations, with new recording equipment and instruments installed, and that with this done, Enya and the Ryans were eager to start working on new music.
A 20th-anniversary vinyl picture disc re-release of the ""May It Be"" single was also released in late 2021.
Enya's music continues to be sampled or interpolated by many modern-day producers, particularly her 1986 humming song ""Boadicea"", in songs within the R&B or hip-hop genres. Enya had previously noted for her 2015 album Dark Sky Island, that ""several songs here have a stronger beat, and even a little hip-hop influence"".
In 2022, for Metro Boomin and The Weeknd's song ""Creepin'"", Enya didn't approve of the song to be released under the working title ""IDWK"" (referring to the song I Don't Wanna Know) so Metro reportedly asked Enya to select song titles that she would be happy with, which included ""Undecided,"" ""Creepin'"", ""Don't Come Back to Me"", ""Better Off That Way"" and ""Wanna Let You Know"". Metro said ""Creepin''' was the one [...] It ended up being a blessing because it's the best name for it.""
In June 2023, Enya's 1997 limited compilation A Box of Dreams was re-issued on 6 vinyl LPs, featuring new liner notes. Nicky Ryan confirmed that they were working on a new album and the possibility of a book based on the trio's thoughts regarding the Oceans tracks was also mentioned. Enya's note, in Irish, read ""Beidh muid ag teacht le chéile gan mhoile"", which roughly translates to ""We will meet again soon"".
On 19 September 2023, a watch party video for the 35th anniversary of Watermark was also presented. Alongside this, vinyl LPs of Watermark and a Dolby Atmos upmixed audio for ""Orinoco Flow"" were also released.
Enya's official website was rebooted, returned to Warner ownership and stylised in late 2023.

Musical style
Enya has cited her musical foundations as ""the classics"", church music, and ""Irish reels and jigs"" with a particular interest in Sergei Rachmaninoff, a favourite composer of hers. She has an autographed picture of him in her home. Since 1982, she has recorded her music with Nicky Ryan as producer and arranger and his wife Roma Ryan as a lyricist. While in Clannad, Enya chose to work with Nicky as the two shared an interest in vocal harmonies, and Ryan, influenced by The Beach Boys and the ""Wall of Sound"" technique that Phil Spector pioneered, wanted to explore the idea of ""the multi-vocals"" for which her music became known. According to Enya, ""Angeles"" from Shepherd Moons has roughly 500 vocals recorded individually and layered. Enya performs all vocals and the majority of instruments in her songs, apart from guest musicians (playing percussion, guitar, violin, uilleann pipes, cornet, and double bass). Her early works, including Watermark, feature piano and numerous keyboard synthesisers including the Yamaha KX88 Master, Yamaha DX7, Oberheim Matrix, Kurzweil K250, Fairlight III E-mu Emulator II, Akai S900, PPG Wave Computer 360, Roland D-50 (famously used with the Pizzagogo patch in ""Orinoco Flow""), and the Roland Juno-60, the latter a particular favourite of hers. Her vocal range has been classified as mezzo-soprano.
Numerous critics and reviewers classify Enya's albums as new-age music and she has won four Grammy Awards in the category. However, Enya does not consider her music as part of the genre; ""the only way I can describe it [...] it's Enya music"". Nicky Ryan commented on the new age designation: ""Initially it was fine, but it's really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot. So I can't see a comparison."" In 1988, Enya is believed to have said about New Age music ""it's air, thin air. It's a musical drug"" and noted its spineless nature, unlike her own music. In a later interview, Enya said that she ""felt that title was given to any musician whom critics didn't know how to pigeonhole.""
Older artwork often inspires some of the visuals that accompany Enya's music. The 1991 music video for ""Caribbean Blue"", and the 1995 album cover artwork for The Memory of Trees both feature adapted works from artist Maxfield Parrish. In the 1996 music video for ""On My Way Home"", scenes of girls lighting paper lanterns to hang in flowery foliage were inspired by John Singer Sargent's painting Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose.
In addition to her native Irish, Enya has recorded songs in languages including English, French, Latin, Spanish, and Welsh. She has recorded music influenced by works from fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, including the instrumental ""Lothlórien"" from Shepherd Moons. For The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, she sang ""May It Be"" in English and Tolkien's fictional language Quenya, and she sang ""Aníron"" in another of Tolkien's fictional languages, Sindarin. Amarantine and Dark Sky Island include songs sung in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma Ryan, that has no official syntax. Its vocabulary was formed by Enya singing the song's notes to which Roma wrote their phonetic spelling.
Enya adopted a composing and songwriting method that has deviated little throughout her career. At the start of the recording process for an album, she enters the studio, forgetting about her previous success, fame, and songs of hers that became hits. ""If I did that"", she said, ""I'd have to call it a day"". She then develops ideas on the piano, keeping note of any arrangement that can be worked on further. During her time writing, Enya works a five-day week, takes weekends off, and does not work on her music at home. With Irish as her first language, Enya initially records her songs in Irish as she can express ""feeling much more directly"" in Irish than in English. After some time, Enya presents her ideas to Nicky to discuss what pieces work best, while Roma works in parallel to devise lyrics for the songs. Enya considered ""Fallen Embers"" from A Day Without Rain a perfect time when the lyrics reflect how she felt while writing the song. In 2008, she newly discovered her tendency to write ""two or three songs"" during the winter months, work on the arrangements and lyrics the following spring and summer, and then work on the next couple of songs when autumn arrives.

Live performances
Enya says that Warner Music and she ""did not see eye to eye"" initially as the label imagined her performing on stage ""with a piano... maybe two or three synthesizer players and that's it"". Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums caused her to ""run overtime"", leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Ryan said Enya had received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after And Winter Came... (2008) to perform a show at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that would be simulcast to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enter a studio and record ""all the hits"" live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.
Enya has sung with live and lip-syncing vocals on various talk and music shows, events, and ceremonies throughout her career, most often during her worldwide press tours for each album. In December 1995, she performed ""Anywhere Is"" at a Christmas concert at Vatican City with Pope John Paul II in attendance; he later met and thanked her for performing. In April 1996, Enya performed the same song during her surprise appearance at the fiftieth birthday celebration for Carl XVI Gustaf, the king of Sweden and a fan of Enya's. In 1997, Enya participated in a live Christmas Eve broadcast in London and flew to County Donegal afterward to join her family for their annual midnight Mass choral performance, in which she participates each year. In March 2002, she performed ""May It Be"" with an orchestra at the year's Academy Awards ceremony. Enya and her sisters performed as part of the local choir Cor Mhuire in July 2005 at St. Mary's church in Gweedore during the annual Earagail Arts Festival.

Personal life
Known for her private lifestyle, Enya has said, ""The music is what sells. Not me, or what I stand for... that's the way I've always wanted it."" She is unmarried and childfree, but has many nieces and nephews and is considered an aunt to the Ryans' two daughters, having shared their Artane home for almost a decade. In 1991, she said, ""I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think a great deal about this."" A relationship she had with one man ended in 1997, around the time when she considered taking time out of music to have a family, but found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and ""gone the route [she] wanted to go"".
At an auction in 1997, Enya spent £2.5 million on a 157-year-old Victorian listed castellated mansion in Killiney. Formerly known as Victoria Castle and Ayesha Castle, the house was renamed by Enya as Manderley Castle after the house featured in Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca (1938). Prior to moving into the castle, Enya was believed to have resided in London, and spent time there throughout the 2000s. She spent several years renovating the castle, and installing considerable security measures because of threats from stalkers. The improvements covered gaps in the house's outer wall, installed new solid timber entrance gates and 1.2-metre (4 ft) iron railings, and brought the surrounding 41 metres (135 ft) of stone wall up to a new height of 2.7 metres (9 ft). In late 2005, the property had two security breaches; during one incident, two people attacked and tied up one of her housekeepers before stealing several items. Enya alerted police by raising an alarm from her safe room. Enya oversaw most of the interior design (decorations and furnishings of her castle); she was ""not going to trust that to anyone else"".
Enya is not known to express political opinions, although a translated quote from a Belgian interview in 1988 – ""generations old potentates and politicians have reduced the whole nation to beggary"" – provides a slight insight into her stance on political and social matters. She also admires the authors Oscar Wilde and J. R. R. Tolkien, in addition to the current Pope Francis. Enya has identified herself as ""more spiritual than religious"" and has said that she sometimes prays, but prefers ""going into churches when they're empty"".
Aside from music, Enya has an appreciation for art, and as of 2000 was collecting artworks by Irish artists including Jack Butler Yeats and Louis le Brocquy and the British artist Albert Goodwin. First editions of books are also something Enya enjoys collecting. Enya recalled reading books in her youth such as The Lord of the Rings, and Malory Towers series by Enid Blyton, prior to going to boarding school herself. Visual-media-wise, she has mentioned watching operas, such as Madame Butterfly at the Sydney Opera House, and enjoying classic black-and-white films, especially those directed by Alfred Hitchcock. She is also drawn to crime drama or period drama series, such as Breaking Bad, and Mad Men, saying ""myself, Nicky, and Roma are huge fans of Breaking Bad. We just didn't miss an episode.""

Erik Satie,"Eric Alfred Leslie Satie (17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925), who signed his name Erik Satie after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. He was the son of a French father and a British mother. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, but was an undistinguished student and obtained no diploma. In the 1880s he worked as a pianist in café-cabaret in Montmartre, Paris, and began composing works, mostly for solo piano, such as his Gymnopédies and Gnossiennes. He also wrote music for a Rosicrucian sect to which he was briefly attached.
After a spell in which he composed little, Satie entered Paris's second music academy, the Schola Cantorum, as a mature student. His studies there were more successful than those at the Conservatoire. From about 1910 he became the focus of successive groups of young composers attracted by his unconventionality and originality. Among them were the group known as Les Six. A meeting with Jean Cocteau in 1915 led to the creation of the ballet Parade (1917) for Serge Diaghilev, with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine.
Satie's example guided a new generation of French composers away from post-Wagnerian impressionism towards a sparer, terser style. Among those influenced by him during his lifetime were Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, and Francis Poulenc, and he is seen as an influence on more recent, minimalist composers such as John Cage and John Adams. His harmony is often characterised by unresolved chords, he sometimes dispensed with bar-lines, as in his Gnossiennes, and his melodies are generally simple and often reflect his love of old church music. He gave some of his later works absurd titles, such as Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien) (""True Flabby Preludes (for a Dog)"", 1912), Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois (""Sketches and Exasperations of a Big Wooden Man"", 1913) and Sonatine bureaucratique (""Bureaucratic Sonatina"", 1917). Most of his works are brief, and the majority are for solo piano. Exceptions include his ""symphonic drama"" Socrate (1919) and two late ballets Mercure and Relâche (1924).
Satie never married, and his home for most of his adult life was a single small room, first in Montmartre and, from 1898 to his death, in Arcueil, a suburb of Paris. He adopted various images over the years, including a period in quasi-priestly dress, another in which he always wore identically coloured velvet suits, and is known for his last persona, in neat bourgeois costume, with bowler hat, wing collar, and umbrella. He was a lifelong heavy drinker, and died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 59.

Life and career
Early years
Satie was born on 17 May 1866 in Honfleur, Normandy, the first child of Alfred Satie and his wife Jane Leslie (née Anton). Jane Satie was an English Protestant of Scottish descent; Alfred Satie, a shipping broker, was a Roman Catholic anglophobe. A year later, the Saties had a daughter, Olga, and in 1869 a second son, Conrad. The children were baptised in the Anglican church.
After the Franco-Prussian War, Alfred Satie sold his business and the family moved to Paris, where he eventually set up as a music publisher. In 1872 Jane Satie died and Eric and his brother were sent back to Honfleur to be brought up by Alfred's parents. The boys were rebaptised as Roman Catholics and educated at a local boarding school, where Satie excelled in history and Latin but nothing else. In 1874 he began taking music lessons with a local organist, Gustave Vinot, a former pupil of Louis Niedermeyer. Vinot stimulated Satie's love of old church music, and in particular Gregorian chant.
In 1878 Satie's grandmother died, and the two boys returned to Paris to be informally educated by their father. Satie did not attend a school, but his father took him to lectures at the Collège de France and engaged a tutor to teach Eric Latin and Greek. Before the boys returned to Paris from Honfleur, Alfred had met a piano teacher and salon composer, Eugénie Barnetche, whom he married in January 1879, to the dismay of the twelve-year-old Satie, who did not like her.
Eugénie Satie resolved that her elder stepson should become a professional musician, and in November 1879 enrolled him in the preparatory piano class at the Paris Conservatoire. Satie strongly disliked the Conservatoire, which he described as ""a vast, very uncomfortable, and rather ugly building; a sort of district prison with no beauty on the inside – nor on the outside, for that matter"". He studied solfeggio with Albert Lavignac and piano with Émile Decombes, who had been a pupil of Frédéric Chopin. In 1880 Satie took his first examinations as a pianist: he was described as ""gifted but indolent"". The following year Decombes called him ""the laziest student in the Conservatoire"". In 1882 he was expelled from the Conservatoire for his unsatisfactory performance. 

In 1884 Satie wrote his first known composition, a short Allegro for piano, written while on holiday in Honfleur. He signed himself ""Erik"" on this and subsequent compositions, though continuing to use ""Eric"" on other documents until 1906. In 1885, he was readmitted to the Conservatoire, in the intermediate piano class of his stepmother's former teacher, Georges Mathias. He made little progress: Mathias described his playing as ""Insignificant and laborious"" and Satie himself ""Worthless. Three months just to learn the piece. Cannot sight-read properly"". Satie became fascinated by aspects of religion. He spent much time in Notre-Dame de Paris contemplating the stained glass windows and in the National Library examining obscure medieval manuscripts. His friend Alphonse Allais later dubbed him ""Esotérik Satie"". From this period comes Ogives, a set of four piano pieces inspired by Gregorian chant and Gothic church architecture.
Keen to leave the Conservatoire, Satie volunteered for military service, and joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment in November 1886. He quickly found army life no more to his liking than the Conservatoire, and deliberately contracted acute bronchitis by standing in the open, bare-chested, on a winter night. After three months' convalescence he was invalided out of the army.

Montmartre
In 1887, at the age of 21, Satie moved from his father's residence to lodgings in the 9th arrondissement. By this time he had started what was to be an enduring friendship with the romantic poet Contamine de Latour, whose verse he set in some of his early compositions, which Satie senior published. His lodgings were close to the popular Chat Noir cabaret on the southern edge of Montmartre where he became an habitué and then a resident pianist. The Chat Noir was known as the ""temple de la 'convention farfelue'"" – the temple of zany convention, and as the biographer Robert Orledge puts it, Satie, ""free from his restrictive upbringing … enthusiastically embraced the reckless bohemian lifestyle and created for himself a new persona as a long-haired man-about-town in frock coat and top hat"". This was the first of several personas that Satie invented for himself over the years.

In the late 1880s Satie styled himself on at least one occasion ""Erik Satie – gymnopédiste"", and his works from this period include the three Gymnopédies (1888) and the first Gnossiennes (1889 and 1890). He earned a modest living as pianist and conductor at the Chat Noir, before falling out with the proprietor and moving to become second pianist at the nearby Auberge du Clou. There he became a close friend of Claude Debussy, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition. Both were bohemians, enjoying the same café society and struggling to survive financially. At the Auberge du Clou Satie first encountered the flamboyant, self-styled ""Sâr"" Joséphin Péladan, for whose mystic sect, the Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique du Temple et du Graal, he was appointed composer. This gave him scope for experiment, and Péladan's salons at the fashionable Galerie Durand-Ruel gained Satie his first public hearings. Frequently short of money, Satie moved from his lodgings in the 9th arrondissement to a small room in the rue Cortot not far from Sacre-Coeur, so high up the Butte Montmartre that he said he could see from his window all the way to the Belgian border.
By mid-1892, Satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own making (Fête donnée par des Chevaliers Normands en l'honneur d'une jeune demoiselle), provided incidental music to a chivalric esoteric play (two Préludes du Nazaréen), had a hoax published (announcing the premiere of his non-existent Le bâtard de Tristan, an anti-Wagnerian opera), and broken away from Péladan, starting that autumn with the ""Uspud"" project, a ""Christian Ballet"", in collaboration with Latour. He challenged the musical establishment by proposing himself – unsuccessfully – for the seat in the Académie des Beaux-Arts made vacant by the death of Ernest Guiraud. Between 1893 and 1895, Satie, affecting a quasi-priestly dress, was the founder and only member of the Eglise Métropolitaine d'Art de Jésus Conducteur. From his ""Abbatiale"" in the rue Cortot, he published scathing attacks on his artistic enemies.

In 1893 Satie had what is believed to be his only love affair, a five-month liaison with the painter Suzanne Valadon. After their first night together, he proposed marriage. The two did not marry, but Valadon moved to a room next to Satie's at the rue Cortot. Satie became obsessed with her, calling her his Biqui and writing impassioned notes about ""her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet"". During their relationship Satie composed the Danses gothiques as a means of calming his mind, and Valadon painted his portrait, which she gave him. After five months she moved away, leaving him devastated. He said later that he was left with ""nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness"".
In 1895 Satie attempted to change his image once again: this time to that of ""the Velvet Gentleman"". From the proceeds of a small legacy he bought seven identical dun-coloured suits. Orledge comments that this change ""marked the end of his Rose+Croix period and the start of a long search for a new artistic direction"".

Move to Arcueil
In 1898, in search of somewhere cheaper and quieter than Montmartre, Satie moved to a room in the southern suburbs, in the commune of Arcueil-Cachan, eight kilometres (five miles) from the centre of Paris. This remained his home for the rest of his life. No visitors were ever admitted. He joined a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the Communist Party),  but adopted a thoroughly bourgeois image: the biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier, writes, ""With his umbrella and bowler hat, he resembled a quiet school teacher. Although a Bohemian, he looked very dignified, almost ceremonious"".
Satie earned a living as a cabaret pianist, adapting more than a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own. The most popular of these were Je te veux, text by Henry Pacory; Tendrement, text by Vincent Hyspa; Poudre d'or, a waltz; La Diva de l'Empire, text by Dominique Bonnaud/Numa Blès; Le Picadilly, a march; Légende californienne, text by Contamine de Latour (lost, but the music later reappears in La belle excentrique); and others. In his later years Satie rejected all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature. Only a few compositions that he took seriously remain from this period: Jack in the Box, music to a pantomime by Jules Depaquit (called a ""clownerie"" by Satie); Geneviève de Brabant, a short comic opera to a text by ""Lord Cheminot"" (Latour); Le poisson rêveur (The Dreamy Fish), piano music to accompany a lost tale by Cheminot, and a few others that were mostly incomplete. Few were presented, and none published at the time.

A decisive change in Satie's musical outlook came after he heard the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902. He found it ""absolutely astounding"", and he re-evaluated his own music. In a determined attempt to improve his technique, and against Debussy's advice, he enrolled as a mature student at Paris's second main music academy, the Schola Cantorum in October 1905, continuing his studies there until 1912. The institution was run by Vincent d'Indy, who emphasised orthodox technique rather than creative originality. Satie studied counterpoint with Albert Roussel and composition with d'Indy, and was a much more conscientious and successful student than he had been at the Conservatoire in his youth.
It was not until 1911, when he was in his mid-forties, that Satie came to the notice of the musical public in general. In January of that year Maurice Ravel played some early Satie works at a concert by the Société musicale indépendante, a forward-looking group set up by Ravel and others as a rival to the conservative Société nationale de musique. Satie was suddenly seen as ""the precursor and apostle of the musical revolution now taking place""; he became a focus for young composers. Debussy, having orchestrated the first and third Gymnopédies, conducted them in concert. The publisher Demets asked for new works from Satie, who was finally able to give up his cabaret work and devote himself to composition. Works such as the cycle Sports et divertissements (1914) were published in de luxe editions. The press began to write about Satie's music, and a leading pianist, Ricardo Viñes, took him up, giving celebrated first performances of some Satie pieces.

Last years
Satie became the focus of successive groups of young composers, whom he first encouraged and then distanced himself from, sometimes rancorously, when their popularity threatened to eclipse his or they otherwise displeased him. First were the ""jeunes"" – those associated with Ravel – and then a group known at first as the ""nouveaux jeunes"", later called Les Six, including Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, and Germaine Tailleferre, joined later by Francis Poulenc and Darius Milhaud. Satie dissociated himself from the second group in 1918, and in the 1920s he became the focal point of another set of young composers including Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, Roger Désormière, Maxime Jacob and Henri Sauguet, who became known as the ""Arcueil School"". In addition to turning against Ravel, Auric and Poulenc in particular, Satie quarrelled with his old friend Debussy in 1917, resentful of the latter's failure to appreciate the more recent Satie compositions. The rupture lasted for the remaining months of Debussy's life, and when he died the following year, Satie refused to attend the funeral. A few of his protégés escaped his displeasure, and Milhaud and Désormière were among those who remained friends with him to the last.

The First World War restricted concert-giving to some extent, but Orledge comments that the war years brought ""Satie's second lucky break"", when Jean Cocteau heard Viñes and Satie perform the Trois morceaux in 1916. This led to the commissioning of the ballet Parade, premiered in 1917 by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine. This was a succès de scandale, with jazz rhythms and  instrumentation including parts for typewriter, steamship whistle and siren. It firmly established Satie's name before the public, and thereafter his career centred on the theatre, writing mainly to commission.
In October 1916 Satie received a commission from the Princesse de Polignac that resulted in what Orledge rates as the composer's masterpiece, Socrate, two years later. Satie set translations from Plato's Dialogues as a ""symphonic drama"". Its composition was interrupted in 1917 by a libel suit brought against him by a music critic, Jean Poueigh, which nearly resulted in a jail sentence for Satie. When Socrate was premiered, Satie called it ""a return to classical simplicity with a modern sensibility"", and among those who admired the work was Igor Stravinsky, a composer whom Satie regarded with awe.
In his later years Satie became known for his prose. He was in demand as a journalist, making contributions to the Revue musicale, Action, L'Esprit nouveau, the Paris-Journal  and other publications from the Dadaist 391 to the English-language magazines Vanity Fair and The Transatlantic Review. As he contributed anonymously or under pen names to some publications it is not certain how many titles he wrote for, but Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians lists 25. Satie's habit of embellishing the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks became so established that he had to insist that they must not be read out during performances.
In 1920 there was a festival of Satie's music at the Salle Erard in Paris. In 1924 the ballets Mercure (with choreography by Massine and décor by Picasso) and Relâche (""Cancelled"") (in collaboration with Francis Picabia and René Clair), both provoked headlines with their first night scandals. 

Despite being a musical iconoclast, and encourager of modernism, Satie was uninterested to the point of antipathy about innovations such as the telephone, the gramophone and the radio. He made no recordings, and as far as is known heard only a single radio broadcast (of Milhaud's music) and made only one telephone call. Although his personal appearance was customarily immaculate, his room at Arcueil was in Orledge's word ""squalid"", and after his death the scores of several important works believed lost were found among the accumulated rubbish. He was incompetent with money. Having depended to a considerable extent on the generosity of friends in his early years, he was little better off when he began to earn a good income from his compositions, as he spent or gave away money as soon as he received it. He liked children, and they liked him, but his relations with adults were seldom straightforward. One of his last collaborators, Picabia, said of him:

Satie's case is extraordinary. He's a mischievous and cunning old artist. At least, that's how he thinks of himself. Myself, I think the opposite! He's a very susceptible man, arrogant, a real sad child, but one who is sometimes made optimistic by alcohol. But he's a good friend, and I like him a lot.
Throughout his adult life Satie was a heavy drinker, and in 1925 his health collapsed. He was taken to the Hôpital Saint-Joseph in Paris, diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. He died there at 8.00 p.m. on 1 July, at the age of 59. He was buried in the cemetery at Arcueil.

Works
Music
In the view of the Oxford Dictionary of Music, Satie's importance lay in ""directing a new generation of French composers away from Wagner‐influenced impressionism towards a leaner, more epigrammatic style"". Debussy christened him ""the precursor"" because of his early harmonic innovations. Satie summed up his musical philosophy in 1917:

To have a feeling for harmony is to have a feeling for tonality… the melody is the Idea, the outline; as much as it is the form and the subject matter of a work. The harmony is an illumination, an exhibition of the object, its reflection.

Among his earliest compositions were sets of three Gymnopédies (1888) and his Gnossiennes (1889 onwards) for piano. They evoke the ancient world by what the critics Roger Nichols and Paul Griffiths describe as ""pure simplicity, monotonous repetition, and highly original modal harmonies"".
It is possible that their simplicity and originality were influenced by Debussy; it is also possible that it was Satie who influenced Debussy. During the brief spell when Satie was composer to Péladan's sect he adopted a similarly austere manner.
While Satie was earning his living as a café pianist in Montmartre he contributed songs and little waltzes. After moving to Arcueil he began to write works with quirky titles, such as the seven-movement suite Trois morceaux en forme de poire (""Three Pear-shaped Pieces"") for piano four-hands (1903), simply-phrased music that Nichols and Griffiths describe as ""a résumé of his music since 1890"" – reusing some of his earlier work as well as popular songs of the time. He struggled to find his own musical voice. Orledge writes that this was partly because of his ""trying to ape his illustrious peers …  we find bits of Ravel in his miniature opera Geneviève de Brabant and echoes of both Fauré and Debussy in the Nouvelles pièces froides of 1907"".
After concluding his studies at the Schola Cantorum in 1912 Satie composed with greater confidence and more prolifically. Orchestration, despite his studies with d'Indy, was never his strongest suit, but his grasp of counterpoint is evident in the opening bars of Parade, and from the outset of his composing career he had original and distinctive ideas about harmony. In his later years he composed sets of short instrumental works with absurd titles, including Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien) (""True Flabby Preludes (for a Dog)"", 1912), Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois (""Sketches and Exasperations of a Big Wooden Man"", 1913) and Sonatine bureaucratique (""Bureaucratic Sonata"", 1917). 

In his neat, calligraphic hand, Satie would write extensive instructions for his performers, and although his words appear at first sight to be humorous and deliberately nonsensical, Nichols and Griffiths comment, ""a sensitive pianist can make much of injunctions such as 'arm yourself with clairvoyance' and 'with the end of your thought'"". His Sonatine bureaucratique anticipates the neoclassicism soon adopted by Stravinsky. Despite his rancorous falling out with Debussy, Satie commemorated his long-time friend in 1920, two years after Debussy's death, in the anguished ""Elégie"", the first of the miniature song cycle Quatre petites mélodies. Orledge rates the cycle as the finest, though least known, of the four sets of short songs of Satie's last decade.
Satie invented what he called Musique d'ameublement – ""furniture music"" – a kind of background not to be listened to consciously. Cinéma, composed for the René Clair film Entr'acte, shown between the acts of Relâche (1924), is an example of early film music designed to be unconsciously absorbed rather than carefully listened to.
Satie is regarded by some writers as an influence on minimalism, which developed in the 1960s and later. The musicologist Mark Bennett and the composer Humphrey Searle have said that John Cage's music shows Satie's influence, and Searle and the writer Edward Strickland have used the term ""minimalism"" in connection with Satie's Vexations, which the composer implied in his manuscript should be played over and over again 840 times. John Adams included a specific homage to Satie's music in his 1996 Century Rolls.

Writings
Satie wrote extensively for the press, but unlike his professional colleagues such as  Debussy and Dukas he did not write primarily as a music critic. Much of his writing is connected to music tangentially if at all. His biographer Caroline Potter describes him as ""an experimental creative writer, a blagueur who provoked, mystified and amused his readers"". He wrote jeux d'esprit claiming to eat dinner in four minutes with a diet of exclusively white food (including bones and fruit mould), or to drink boiled wine mixed with fuchsia juice, or to be woken by a servant hourly throughout the night to have his temperature taken; he wrote in praise of Beethoven's non-existent but ""sumptuous"" Tenth Symphony, and the family of instruments known as the cephalophones, ""which have a compass of thirty octaves and are absolutely unplayable"".
Satie grouped some of these writings under the general headings Cahiers d'un mammifère (A Mammal's Notebook) and Mémoires d'un amnésique (Memoirs of an Amnesiac), indicating, as Potter comments, that ""these are not autobiographical writings in the conventional manner"". He claimed the major influence on his humour was Oliver Cromwell, adding ""I also owe much to Christopher Columbus, because the American spirit has occasionally tapped me on the shoulder and I have been delighted to feel its ironically glacial bite"".
His published writings include:

Erik Wøllo,"Erik Wøllo (born 1961) is a Norwegian composer and musician, guitarist and synthesist. He has a background in various genres in music. As a solo recording artist, he is most known for his electronic and ambient musical soundscapes. Music that can be classified in the genres of space, drone, new age, and electronic music. Through his many albums he has gained recognition for his unique sound and style. Using guitar as the primary instrument in a highly imaginary and emotional music, building a bridge between grand symphonic realms and gentle, minimalistic and serene atmospheres.

History and Overview
Born and raised in Norway (Hemsedal). In the era when he grew up in Norway, the local folk music is very much dominated by the Hardanger fiddle, and his grandfather once offered him a fiddle as a birthday present, if he wanted to start playing. But he went for the guitar, and started to play at age 11.
His first influence was the evolving heavy/progressive rock music in the seventies, although he once said his first guitar hero was John Fogerty. He soon discovered the more complicated and intricate styles of rock, like Pink Floyd, Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer. Which led him gradually into more contemporary electronic music genres.
He started his professional career in 1980, playing and touring around Norway in various jazz/rock and fusion bands. But in 1984, he decided to concentrate full-time on his own solo career, building his own studio Wintergarden, where he started to explore and create his new soundworld.
His third album ""Traces"" (1985), was a turning point in his creative musical approach, and pointed out his unique style in instrumental music. This album represented an important and seminal time for Wøllo's artistic development.
Erik says in a private interview: “I quit all the bands I played in, I wanted to work on my own using the modern electronic studio as an instrument. Like a painter with his oil canvasses. I wanted to make a music that had expansive synthesizer textures and sequencer patterns, layered together with expressive melodic electric guitars. Working with depth, time and space. In those years in the early eighties the studio technology was new and revolutionary, and I wanted to explore all the new possibilities. To be able to control the infinite variations of electronic sound, using an endless palette for creative expression. Musically this technology opened up a new possible world for me, and I have continued to further develop and refine these musical ideas on later recordings.
Also for the last decades, I have been able to bring this my musical concept to the stage, performing live. I have been doing several tours, as well as releasing a double CD set live album ""Silent Currents"" (Projekt, CD-2011). As well as three download live albums ""Silent Currents 3"" (2013), ""Star’s End 2015"" (Silent Currents 4), and ""Winter Tide"" - Live at Soundquest Fest 2021 (Projekt, Digital). I have also done several live concerts with Ian Boddy and Steve Roach. In August 2019, I performed a main act concert with special written music for an outdoor festival in Norway, featuring Trey Gunn, Kouame Sereba and Jerry Marotta.""
Erik has also written music for diverse acoustic ensembles, such as string quartets, wind quintets and sinfoniettas. As one of very few Norwegian composers, these scores were all written in the classical minimalistic tradition.
He has released more than 50 solo albums and several smaller format EP's, all distributed globally and he has gained a large audience for his music.
He has received the Schallwelle Award in Germany for ""Revolve"", for best Ambient album in 2023 (together with Ian Boddy).

Collaborations
Erik Wøllo has also collaborated and released album works together with some of the most respected artists in the ambient music world: with Steve Roach (""Stream of Thought"", CD-2009 & ""The Road Eternal"", CD-2011), Michael Stearns (""Convergence"", CD-2020), Ian Boddy (""Frontiers"", CD-2012, ""EC12"", Digital-2014, ""Meridian, CD-2018 and ""Revolve"", CD-2023), Byron Metcalf (""Earth Luminous"", CD-2016), Bernhard Wöstheinrich (""Arcadia Borealis"", CD-2009 and ""Weltenuhr, CD-2014), and several others.
One of the areas Wøllo has been deeply exploring for many decades, is the connections between the various art forms. Focusing on finding mutual and parallel aspects, he has been making music for use together with other media, like film, modern ballet and theater. Also together with diverse experimental visual art forms for gallery exhibitions. (photography, fine art, literature and video art). Wøllo is also a visual artist and have created several album covers, including some of his own releases.

Personal
Erik Wøllo currently lives on Hvaler, an island in the south of Norway. He is married, and has one son.

Explosions in the Sky,"Explosions in the Sky is an American post-rock band from Texas. The band is a quartet, composed of drummer Chris Hrasky and guitarist/keyboardists Michael James, Munaf Rayani and Mark Smith. The band originally played under the name Breaker Morant, then changed to the current name in 1999. They primarily play with three electric guitars and a drum kit, although James will at times exchange his electric guitar for a bass guitar and all three guitarists also add additional keyboard and synthesizer parts. The band later added a fifth musician to their live performances, largely to accommodate for these bass and keyboard parts – a role currently held by multi-instrumentalist Jay Demko. The band has released eight studio albums to date; their most recent, End, was released in September 2023.
The band has garnered popularity beyond the post-rock scene for their elaborately developed guitar work, narratively styled instrumentals – which they refer to as ""cathartic mini-symphonies"" – and their emotional live shows.

History
Originally called Breaker Morant, Explosions in the Sky was formed in Austin, Texas, in 1999. Drummer Chris Hrasky is from Rockford, Illinois, and the rest of the band hails from Midland, Texas. The new name of ""Explosions in the Sky"" came from a comment Hrasky made in reference to the noise or sight of fireworks when they left KVRX on the night they played their first set and recorded their first track, ""Remember Me as a Time of Day"", that would be released on a compilation. Their 2000 debut album, How Strange, Innocence, was locally distributed in the form of CD-Rs. Rehearsal footage is featured on the feature film Cicadas, which won an Austin Film Festival award.

Explosions in the Sky quickly gained a reputation for themselves among other established bands such as Lift to Experience. Temporary Residence Limited signed the band on the strength of their demo after only half a listen; the demo was submitted by fellow Austin band The American Analog Set with a brief note saying, ""This totally fucking destroys.""
They garnered a small amount of media attention with their second album, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever, due to rumors linking it to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The band denied any connection in interviews. The album art shows an airplane with the caption ""This plane will crash tomorrow."" There were false reports that the last track was called ""This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow"" and that the album was released on September 10, 2001; the concept had actually originated in 2000, and the album was officially released on September 4, 2001. Bassist Michael James was detained in an airport as a threat to security, and had to explain why his guitar contained the words ""this plane will crash tomorrow"".
The band also received a considerable amount of attention playing before large audiences as the opening act of Fugazi's spring 2002 US tour in support of The Argument.
The band released The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place in 2003 and this is generally considered their most famous album.  The album has been described as a concept album and was stated by guitarist Munaf Rayani as the band's attempt at love songs.
After being contacted by Brian Reitzell, Explosions in the Sky wrote the soundtrack for the 2004 film Friday Night Lights. Despite having access to rare equipment in the studio for that project, the band kept to their songwriting style in creating original material.
Their album The Rescue was written and recorded in eight days as part of the TRL Travels in Constants series. As such, the album was originally only available at the band's live shows.
Explosions in the Sky's fifth studio album, All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone, which debuted February 20, 2007, exists as both a one-disc version and a two-disc special edition featuring remixes by multiple artists.
The band began touring on February 19 in the U.S. and Canada.
On April 26, 2011, the band released their sixth studio album, Take Care, Take Care, Take Care.
The band served as one of the support acts for Nine Inch Nails on their North American leg of the Twenty Thirteen Tour in late 2013, alternating dates with Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Following a period of seldom live shows across 2014 and 2015, the band returned in 2016 with their seventh studio album, The Wilderness. Two singles were released from the album prior to its April release: ""Separation Anxiety"" in January, and ""Logic of a Dream"" in February. The band toured extensively in support of the album throughout 2016 and into 2017, playing over 140 shows worldwide.
In April 2023, the band announced via their website their first North American tour since 2019. The tour was dubbed ""The End Tour"", leading to speculation that the tour could be their last. On July 17, however, their official Twitter account announced the release of their eighth album, titled End, for September 15. In a press release for the announcement, they explained that the title came from ""the concept of an ending—death, or the end of a friendship or relationship"", and does not imply that it would be the band's final album.

Musical style and characteristics
Although the band's music deviates from pop, Hrasky said that they have similar goals ""like immediately grabbing your attention and getting to your emotions."" Rayani said, ""We don't consider ourselves post-rock at all; we consider ourselves a rock band.""
In a post-show interview clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani said about their status as instrumentalists, ""I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, and then it just kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough."" Drummer Chris Hrasky added, ""I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us.""

In popular culture
Most notably, Explosions in the Sky's music is heavily featured in the Friday Night Lights movie and television show. It is a common misconception that the band wrote and recorded the television show's theme song. Instead, it is an original composition by W. G. Snuffy Walden. Music by Explosions in the Sky has been used in several television programs and commercials: ""The Birth and Death of the Day"" for the BBC documentary Lost Land of the Jaguar, All the Real Girls, Shopgirl, One Tree Hill, Love the Beast and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, as well as various songs for the PBS documentary The Street Stops Here. A number of One Tree Hill episodes are named after the band's songs.

The song ""It's Natural To Be Afraid"" is featured in the narrative sports documentary series 24/7, ""Mayweather vs. De La Hoya"", and was also used in the season 8 finale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, ""For Gedda (Part 1)"".
The song ""Catastrophe and the Cure"" is used during the intro to Get Collins, an Irish documentary on Michael Collins and the film Kaboom by director Gregg Araki in which the male lead is also given a signed copy of All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone as a birthday gift.
In 2009, the song ""First Breath After Coma"" is used for the introduction of feature presentations on the television network, Versus. The song is also used in the trailer for the documentary Focus, directed by Steve Hwang. ""First Breath After Coma"", along with ""Six Days at the Bottom of the Ocean"", were featured in the 2010 film Kalamity.
The song ""The Only Moment We Were Alone"" is shortly featured in Michael Moore's documentary Capitalism: A Love Story. It is also featured in the 2008 film Sleepwalking.
The song ""Your Hand in Mine"" is featured in the films Friday Night Lights, The Big Empty, Love Happens, The King of Staten Island, the TV series Prisoners' Wives, the documentary Gideon's Army and the Cerveza Pacifico TV commercial ""Anchors Up"".
The song ""A Poor Man's Memory"" is featured in the TV show Blue Mountain State.

Falling Up (band),"Falling Up was an American rock band from Albany, Oregon. Falling Up formed in October 2001 and released their debut album Crashings in 2004. They were signed to BEC Recordings in 2003 after a recommendation from friends in the band Kutless. Their lyrics were heavily inspired by their conundrums with spirituality.  
Over time, the lyrics became more abstract and poetic as the band's style shifted from alternative rock to a more experimental direction and they started creating more diverse music.
The band went through several lineup changes, with only lead vocalist Jessy Ribordy, bassist Jeremy Miller, and drummer Josh Shroy appearing on every album. They became an independent band with the release of Your Sparkling Death Cometh in 2011 and remained as such until the release of their final self-titled album.

History
Crashings and Dawn Escapes (2004–06)
Falling Up debuted on February 24, 2004, with their 12-track album, Crashings. Produced by Aaron Sprinkle. Crashings sold 3,396 units in its first week, which exceeded first-week sales of any other album in the history of BEC Recordings—displacing the previous record held by Kutless, who were childhood friends of Falling Up. Crashings sold over 50,000 units by the end of 2004. Three songs from Crashings—""Broken Heart"", ""Escalates"", and ""Bittersweet""—reached No. 1 on the R&R charts.
Their second album, Dawn Escapes, was released on October 25, 2005, through BEC Recordings. Produced by Michael ""Elvis"" Baskette (Chevelle, Cold), the album, though more melodic and hard rock-driven as a whole, did not deviate far from the sound of Crashings. Dawn Escapes pushed Falling Up's lifetime record sales to over 150,000 by the summer of 2006. Guitarist Tom Cox left the band shortly before the album's release, eventually going on to form his own band, Archers Rise, whose debut release was produced by Ribordy. He was replaced by guitarist Micah Sannan.
On September 12, 2006, Falling Up released Exit Lights, an album featuring remixes of the band's biggest hits and the new song ""Islander"". Solomon Olds of Family Force 5, Thousand Foot Krutch's Trevor McNevan, and Randy Torres of Project 86 fame were among the artists who worked with Falling Up for the project. Guitarist Joseph Kisselburgh left the band in May 2006 to focus on his solo project, The Send, which released its debut album on Tooth & Nail Records in July 2007. The band enlisted a number of touring guitarists (including Hawk Nelson's Jonathan Steingard) to fill in for Kisselburgh during summer tour dates, although no permanent replacement was ever sought, with the group remaining a five-piece afterwards.

Captiva and Fangs! (2007–09)
The band announced the release date for their next project, code-named ""Abandoners"", on their Myspace page. Later on, they would announce the release name Captiva. The album was released on October 2, 2007. The first single from the album was ""Hotel Aquarium"", followed by ""Goodnight Gravity"", ""How They Made Cameras"", ""Maps"", and ""A Guide to Marine Life"". The band also filmed a music video for ""Hotel Aquarium"", which was featured in X 2008. After recording but before the release of the album, guitarist Micah Sannan departed Falling Up and joined the band Disciple. Keyboardist Adam Taylor also departed around the same time to manage merchandise for the band Hawk Nelson. Daniel Elder soon joined the band as their new guitar player, reducing the band to a quartet.
Falling Up's fourth studio album, Fangs!, was released March 24, 2009. According to their MySpace page, Fangs! was to be their ""heaviest album yet"", something which was often disputed in the post-release period. It was also said that the album would be ""more of an arrangement than just a record that is put together randomly"" and that it ""[would] not have 14 great songs in entirety, but just intriguing moments and sections"". One of the song titles, ""Lotus and Languorous"", was released early.
According to BEC Recordings and Falling Up's Myspace, Falling Up headlined the Fangs! tour in late April early May 2009 with Tooth and Nail artist Ruth and Portland indie/rock artist Archeology. Unlike past tours, the venues on this tour were strictly secular.

Side projects and hiatus (2009–10)
After the release of Fangs!, band members Jessy Ribordy and Josh Shroy started a side project under the name The River Empires, which created an album Epilogue with the help of The Dear Hunter's Casey Crescenzo and a handful of other musicians. Jessy Ribordy also began working on a solo project, Gloomcatcher, releasing its first album, Slow Chorale. The debut albums from both projects were released on April 6, 2010.
On January 20, 2010, lead vocalist Jessy Ribordy announced that Falling Up was ""taking a permanent break"" and that their final show would be held at the Parachute Music Festival on January 29.

Independent reunion and Your Sparkling Death Cometh (2010–12)
On October 22, 2010, the band updated their MySpace page with information that new music was ""in the works"". The website FallingUpLives.com was then launched, followed by a Kickstarter campaign. Jessy explained on the website that the reason for the breakup was due to the band members wanting to explore other musical endeavors and the fact the BEC did not support the band's ideas for future releases. Jessy also stated that the band members felt uncomfortable ending Falling Up so abruptly, leading to their decision to return making music, independently this time. 
On January 21, 2011, Falling Up's Kickstarter campaign for their new album ended, having raised $13,665, more than their goal of $10,000. Rewards for the campaign included an exclusive download of two of Falling Up's demo songs, ""Phantasm"" and ""Monster Blood"", both of which were tracks cut from their Captiva album, an exclusive T-shirt, signed copies of the new record, and cover songs performed by the band. The new record began recording on February 9, 2011, with Jessy Ribordy saying that the album would be released in June of 2011. On March 18, 2011, the band's website was updated with a logo displaying Your Sparkling Death Cometh, and a release date of June 2011. Shortly after, the band confirmed on their Facebook page that ""Your Sparkling Death Cometh"" would be the title of the upcoming album. 
On May 25, 2011, Falling Up released the first single for Your Sparkling Death Cometh, ""Blue Ghost"", on their ReverbNation page. On June 1, 2011, Falling Up released the second single, ""Diamnds"", also on their ReverbNation page. The two singles were generally well received, with ""Diamnds"" being a center point. Although not officially released until June 28, Your Sparkling Death Cometh reportedly arrived to those who had pre-ordered the album as early as June 23. When Your Sparkling Death Cometh was released on June 28, 2011, the album generally received very favorable reviews from critics. It was cited as being exceptionally creative, with a strong focus on originality and composure. 
The same day as the release of Your Sparkling Death Cometh, Falling Up updated their website to fit with the theme of the album. A player was also added, allowing each track from the album to be played in its entirety. Prior to the album's release, the band members stated several times that, depending on the album's reception, it would likely be Falling Up's last project. With the album's release, they added a biography section to their website, which implied that they were hoping to continue Falling Up, even 10 years after its inception.
Following the release of Your Sparkling Death Cometh, Falling Up played their first live show since the Fangs! tour three years prior at the Hawthorne Theatre in Portland, Oregon, on January 7, 2012. Ruth and Water & Bodies were the opening acts for the band.
Falling Up announced in early January 2012 that a remix EP was in the works and also said that they were hoping to have some new music released by the end of the year. On April 11, 2012, the band released Mnemos, their first remix album since Exit Lights.
Mnemos contained seven tracks on its own, and there were also three bonus tracks added when the album reached 1,000 downloads. The tracks found on the album were not full remixes, but repetitions of hooks found in the various sections of Your Sparkling Death Cometh. At the time of Mnemos's release, Falling Up was only able to remix songs from Your Sparkling Death Cometh, due to BEC holding the rights to their previous songs.
The Mnemos EP was released on Groupees through the ""Feed Them with Music"" program, a charity which provides a meal for a needy family for every download. All of Falling Up's profits from the EP were donated to this program. Within the first 24 hours of the album's release there were over 1,500 downloads.

Machine De Ella, Falling Up, and Reimagined (2012–2017)
Falling Up's next project was teased as The Machine De Ella project. The project was eventually revealed to consist of two albums, Hours and Midnight on Earthship, as well as an audio book, also titled Hours, written by Jessy Ribordy. The idea for the project came when the band considered their two different fanbases. Hours was recorded as a concept album based on the book within the project, and was more rock-driven. Midnight on Earthship was toned down in style and contained more introspective and personal lyrics. Both of the albums and the book began their launch on October 9, 2012, and were progressively released over the course of three months.
In August 2014, Falling Up initiated a Kickstarter fundraiser for their tenth full-length album that raised over $48,000, exceeding the $40,000 goal. During the Kickstarter campaign, Falling Up announced that this would be the band's final album. On November 13, 2015, Falling Up released their final studio album, the self-titled Falling Up to critical acclaim.
On June 10, 2016, Falling Up released a two-song EP titled Reimagined to follow through on a reward tier from their Kickstarter campaign. It consisted of two re-created songs, ""Broken Heart"" and ""Arafax Deep,"" which originally debuted on the band's first album, Crashings. In early 2017, the band released their final song, a reimagined cover of Brand New's ""Gasoline"".

Fantômas (band),"Fantômas is an American heavy metal supergroup formed in 1998 in California. It features vocalist Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle), drummer Dave Lombardo (ex-Slayer), guitarist Buzz Osborne (Melvins) and bassist Trevor Dunn (Mr. Bungle, Tomahawk). The band is named after Fantômas, a supervillain featured in a series of crime novels popular in France before World War I and in film, most notably in the '60s French movie series.

History
Fantômas began just before the collapse of Faith No More, as a series of spasmic, avant-garde metal/grindcore songs composed by vocalist and bandleader Mike Patton. Patton then sent the demos to guitarist Buzz Osborne (of Melvins), bass guitarist Trevor Dunn (of Mr. Bungle) and drummer Igor Cavalera (of Sepultura), with the intention of forming a supergroup. Cavalera declined the offer, but recommended who he thought would be perfect for the project: Dave Lombardo of Slayer, who accepted. The band have released all of their albums through Patton's independent label Ipecac, however there was initially interest from several prominent record labels, primarily due to Patton's commercial success with Faith No More. He recalled ""There was a whole lot of interest, at first. People from Geffen and stuff like this came out to the shows. But after the show, they disappeared into the woodwork. There were [also] indies that were interested, but none that I was interested in.""
In mid-2005, the band toured Europe with Terry Bozzio on drums, as Lombardo was on tour with Slayer. Lombardo returned to the band for the final dates of the tour, which concluded on September 15, 2005.
On May 13, 2006, Patton revealed to Billboard.com that a fifth Fantômas album was being planned. Of the album, Patton says, ""The next record is going to be an all-electronic affair. It's going to take some creative planning on how to record it and execute it, but there will be no acoustic instruments on it whatsoever. We're pretty much about to go into hibernation mode. I need to, once I have a little time, go back to the drawing board and start writing the next one."" In November 2008, Rock-A-Rolla, a UK-based alternative music magazine, exclusively revealed on their website that the new album was currently being worked on and a tentative June 2009 release was possible, however, in the May 2009 issue of Rock-A-Rolla, in an interview with Greg Werckman, Werckman stated that Mike ""hasn't even begun"" recording the next Fantômas record.
On July 21, 2011, Rock-A-Rolla revealed that Fantômas would be releasing their December 31, 2008, performance at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall as a DVD and a standalone audio download, titled The Director's Cut Live: A New Year's Revolution. On September 16, 2014, Ipecac Recordings announced that on Record Store Day they would be releasing a boxset titled ""Wunderkammer,"" which would contain all of the Fantômas albums on vinyl as well as a cassette featuring Mike Patton's original demos for the band.
In December 2014, Fantômas played their first shows in six years as part of the Rockout Festival in Santiago, Chile, however no plans have been announced to date regarding a new studio recording.
On June 24, 2017, Fantômas reunited to open for Tool's concert in San Bernardino, California. Due to his touring commitments with Suicidal Tendencies, Dave Lombardo could not perform at the show. Melvins' Dale Crover returned to take Lombardo's place for the performance.

Style
Though rooted in avant-garde metal, Fantômas' music touches on many different musical genres, making liberal use of experimentalism and noise. Fantômas' music is also noted for its absurdism and offbeat sense of humor; one critic dubbed their style ""dada-metal"", a reference to the ""anti-art"" dada movement of the early 1900s.
Patton rarely sings conventional lyrics with the group, preferring his own bizarre style of voice music or scat singing.
The band arrange albums around concepts or themes:

Fantômas is based on science fiction comic books, with every song simply given a page number (""Page 1"", ""Page 2"", etc.). The artwork was mainly taken from the Italian comic Diabolik.
The Director's Cut is a series of reinterpretations of motion picture theme songs. Some versions are rather loyal to the sources (such as the eerie lullabye from The Night of the Hunter), while others offer radical takes on the music (such as the theme from The Godfather, tackled in part as an extreme metal song).
Delìrium Còrdia is one extended song, with the concept of surgery without anesthesia.
Suspended Animation is an album of twisted cartoon music, each track named after a day in the month of April 2005, and the limited-edition, first pressing of the album was itself (literally) a calendar of the month featuring the art of contemporary Japanese pop artist Yoshitomo Nara.

Non-album songs
Fantômas have recorded a few songs which do not appear on their albums:

""Chariot Choogle"" (1:51) – A cover of the song by T.Rex, featured on the Marc Bolan tribute album Great Jewish Music: Marc Bolan. Mike Patton recorded this cover and attributed it to Fantômas.
""Zemaraim"" (3:36) – A version of the song which John Zorn had originally written for his band, Masada, but never performed or recorded. To celebrate Masada's 10th Anniversary, John Zorn organized the release of an album known as The Unknown Masada; Fantômas contributed this song to the release. The song was arranged by Trevor Dunn, and is one of the only songs by Fantômas not to have been written or arranged by Mike Patton.
Where Is the Line (Fantômas Remix) (5:28) – Released as a B-side on Björk's ""Where Is the Line"" vinyl release.
""Animali in calore surriscaldati con ipertermia genitale"" (0:44) – Released on the Fantômas / Melt-Banana split, through Unhip Records, in 2005. The cover art was drawn by Italian artist Igort.
""SKETCHBOOK 1"" -  This is rough demos of songs from the album Fantômas. These songs come from the same session as the Chariot Choogle cover and were largely used to send to the remaining members to learn the songs. Page 20, 16, 26, 9, 15, 2, 19, 25 and 7 were released on the Sugar Daddy Live split release with the Melvins. Page 1-30 were released on a cassette as part of the Wunderkammer box set.

Legacy
Progressive rock band Tool cited Fantômas as a major influence on their 2006 record 10,000 Days. In 2006, Mastodon cited several experimental bands, among them Fantômas, as an inspiration to expand their sound into new directions. Dan Briggs, bassist for Between the Buried and Me, called it ""a big part of [his] musical background"" and considers the Wunderkammer box set one of his most valuable records.
Nu metal band Slipknot was heavily influenced by Fantômas in its beginning. The whole band, who was already a fan of Mike Patton, attended one of their first shows in 1998 before Fantômas released any music and were astounded by their technical prowess, calling them the tightest band they had seen. Its drummer Joey Jordison said that the work of Dave Lombardo on Fantômas should be known by every drummer. Mushroomhead frontman Jason Popson called it his favorite band in 2000.
Other bands influenced by Fantômas are CKY, The Locust and Car Bomb. Known fans of it included actor Danny DeVito, writer Alan Moore and dance music artist Moby.

Frou Frou (band),"Frou Frou () are a British electronic duo composed of musician Imogen Heap and producer/songwriter Guy Sigsworth. They released their only album, Details, in 2002. The duo wrote, produced, and played instruments on the tracks, while Heap also provided lead vocals. In 2004, they recorded a cover of ""Holding Out for a Hero"" by Bonnie Tyler, which was used in the credits of the 2004 film Shrek 2. Frou Frou amicably disbanded later that year.
In 2017, Heap and Sigsworth reunited as Frou Frou for Heap's Mycelia Tour. They released an EP of unreleased Frou Frou demos for Details' 20th anniversary in 2022.

History
1997–2002: Introductions
Heap and Sigsworth met in 1996 when Heap was 17 years old after Sigsworth was given a demo recorded by Heap and asked to meet with her. The two first collaborated when Heap contributed guest vocals to Sigsworth's band Acacia. Sigsworth later wrote two songs for Heap's 1998 debut studio album, I Megaphone, including her debut single, ""Getting Scared"". As Heap went on tour throughout North America and Europe to promote the album, Sigsworth continued to write and produce for other artists, including Madonna and Björk. As Heap's record label Almo Sounds lost funding, they asked Heap for a second album, and dropped her soon after being acquired by Universal, while Acacia was disbanded.
Sigsworth began work on an album in 2001, which he initially envisioned as a solo album consisting of songs written and produced by Sigsworth with features from various singers, poets, and rappers. After working with Heap on a song, Sigsworth instead decided to form Frou Frou with her, and the two began working on an album together.

2002–2003: Details
In 2002, Frou Frou signed a record deal with Universal Records on the Island Records imprint in the UK and Europe, and MCA Records in the USA. They released their first and only album, Details in June 2002. An album of electronic music with elements of trip hop, pop and rock, the eclectic, intricately produced tracks use a wide range of traditional instruments including cellos, autoharps, guitars, keyboards, and Indian drums, with layered vocals from Heap.
The album received critical acclaim, but this did not translate into mass sales the duo had hoped for. ""Breathe In"" was released as the first single internationally. It reached number two on the Italian radio airplay charts, and debuted in the Top 50 in the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up singles ""Must Be Dreaming"" and ""It's Good To Be in Love"" were shelved from commercial release in the UK, however, through lack of radio and TV interest. ""Breathe In"" and ""Must Be Dreaming"" did become minor hits in Asia, particularly in Indonesia, where both singles made Top 10, peaking at number 7 and 5 respectively on the Indonesian Airplay Chart.
A video was made for a fourth single from the album, the closer ""The Dumbing Down of Love"", directed by Joel Peissig (who later directed Heap's solo video ""Hide and Seek""). After touring the record extensively across the United States, where the duo had established a cult fan base, Frou Frou amicably disbanded in 2004.

Sigsworth was contacted in 2004 by music supervisor Chris Douridas, an early fan of Frou Frou, who asked him to record a cover version of Bonnie Tyler's 1984 song ""Holding Out for a Hero"" for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. Although Frou Frou was no longer active, Sigsworth reached out to Heap to record vocals for the cover, and the duo was briefly reformed. Frou Frou also gained popularity in the United States in 2004 after Zach Braff used ""Let Go"" on the soundtrack for his film, Garden State.
The duo also worked together in 2003 on a track for Britney Spears's fourth album In The Zone, entitled ""Over To You Now"". The track was written by Sigsworth, Swedish pop star Robyn and her long-term songwriting companion, and Sigsworth asked Heap to come in and make the song more suitable for Spears, adding backing vocals and making the track more electronic music-infused. Despite not being used on In The Zone, the track was released in late 2005 on the Japan CD single of Spears' single, ""Someday (I Will Understand)"" and on the UK and Japan bonus CDs of the DVD release of her reality TV show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic.

2017–present: Live reunion, Off Cuts
In November 2017, it was announced that Heap and Sigsworth would be reuniting as Frou Frou during Imogen Heap's Mycelia Tour throughout 2018 and 2019. In April 2019, Frou Frou released a live recording of ""Guitar Song"", their first single in 15 years and one of two singles not released at the time of the band's initial break-up, through We Are Hear.
In late March 2022, Imogen Heap partnered with Symphonic Distribution to re-release previous material, including a handful of Frou Frou demos, which have been compiled into the Off Cuts EP, released on 3 June 2022, just shy of Details' 20th anniversary. The first single ""A New Kind of Love (Demo)"" was released 8 April. A studio version of the ""Guitar Song"" demo released as the second single on 6 May.

Genre
Frou Frou's music has been described as electronic, electropop, synth-pop, and alternative pop.

The Future Sound of London,"The Future Sound of London (often abbreviated FSOL) is a British electronic music duo composed of Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans. They have been described as a ""boundary-pushing"" electronic act, covering techno, ambient, house music, trip hop, psychedelia, and dub.
While keeping an enigmatic image and releasing music under many aliases, the band found commercial success with singles ""Papua New Guinea"" (1991) and ""Cascade"" (1993), and albums Lifeforms (1994), ISDN (1995) and Dead Cities (1996). In recent years, the duo has become more candid with their fanbase online. Their later work include their series of experimental Environments and Archives albums.

History
Formation
Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans met in the mid-1980s while studying electronics at university in Manchester. Dougans had already been making electronic music, working between Glasgow and Manchester, when the pair first began working together in local clubs. In 1988, Dougans embarked on a project for a graphic studio Stakker, which resulted with a single ""Stakker Humanoid"" that reached number 17 in the UK charts, introducing acid house to mainstream audience. Cobain contributed to the accompanying album Global. In the following years the pair produced music under a variety of aliases, releasing a number of singles and EPs, including ""Q"" and ""Metropolis"", later featured on the 1992 compilation Earthbeat. They were initially signed to the British sub-label of Passion Music, Jumpin' & Pumpin'.
In 1991, Cobain and Dougans released their breakthrough single, ""Papua New Guinea"" on Jumpin' & Pumpin'. The song was based upon a sample from ""Dawn of the Iconoclast"" by Dead Can Dance and a bassline from ""Radio Babylon"" by Meat Beat Manifesto. It enjoyed great success, charting at #22 for seven weeks in 1992. The single was followed by their debut album, Accelerator, which included ""Papua New Guinea"" among other new tracks. After a few other releases on Jumpin' & Pumpin', they were signed by Virgin Records, with the free reign to experiment.
In 1993, the duo released an ambient album Tales of Ephidrina, the first under the alias Amorphous Androgynous. The focus on texture and mood, while retaining dance beats, was well received. The album was released on Quigley, the band's own short-lived offshoot of Virgin. The band begun experimenting with radio performance, broadcasting three-hour radio shows to Manchester's Kiss FM from their studio.

Lifeforms and the ISDN tour
In 1993, the band released ""Cascade,"" a nearly 40 minutes single which made the UK top 30. It was followed in 1994 by the album Lifeforms, released to critical acclaim and a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. The eponymous single featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The record introduced an array of exotic, tropical sound samples. Dougans' father's involvement in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop had a heavy influence on Lifeforms. Often asked whether Brian Eno was an influence, Cobain and Dougans said they were about looking to the future not the past. To them, Lifeforms was a new work not just another Eno-type ambient album.
That year, the Future Sound of London released a limited-edition album ISDN, which featured live broadcasts made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote Lifeforms, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York, and several appearances on BBC Sessions hosted by John Peel. The shows featured ambient soundscapes with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One performance for BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp. The tone of ISDN was darker and more rhythmic than Lifeforms. The band wanted to achieve something epic and grand, but no matter how much technological or personal support they had they never got to truly do what they envisioned. Cobain said that the 90s were a time of frustration because the technology didn't fit the band's ideas. In 1995, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list.
The band's interests have covered different areas including film and video, 2D and 3D computer graphics, animation in making almost all their own videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating electronic devices for sound making.

Dead Cities
The 1995 edition of John Peel Sessions featured new tracks which moved away from breakbeat and the free sampling of ISDN. In 1996, the band released Dead Cities which expanded upon these early demos, in a mix of ambient textures and dance music. The new sound was introduced in the lead single ""My Kingdom."" The album featured the first collaboration with composer Max Richter, including on a 1997 big beat single ""We Have Explosive"" that featured manipulated samples of Run DMC. The track was used on popular soundtracks to Mortal Kombat Annihilation, and the video game WipE'out"" 2097, the latter also including a new track ""Landmass."" ""We Have Explosive"" was the band's highest-charting single, and over the course of its five-part extended version included hints of funk.
The album was promoted by what the band described as ""the fuck rock'n'roll tour"" via ISDN, gaining attention as the first world tour without leaving a studio. While the 1994 tour focused on creating soundscapes and unreleased material, the 1996 and 1997 shows were more conventional, each offering a different take on music featured on Dead Cities, blending current with occasional unreleased tracks. The final performances included considerable use of live guitar and percussion. These sessions were the basis of the band's later psychedelic projects of the following decade, while others appeared on the subsequent album series From The Archives.

New millennium
After a four-year hiatus, rumours of mental illness began to spread. In an interview, Cobain revealed that he had been undertaking spiritual experimentation and had dealt with a bout of mercury poisoning, with over one hundred times the amount deemed to be safe. He gained much from his experience, realising that he could use music as a tool for psychic exploration, entertainment, and healing.  The pair returned in 2002 with ""The Isness"", a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by Papua New Guinea Translations, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from The Isness sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with Muzik magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it ""...a white beam of light from heaven..."" and other British publications such as The Times, The Guardian and MOJO praising the album and the band's ability to do something so completely different from what they had done before.
Three years on, they followed the album with a continuation of the Amorphous Androgynous project, Alice in Ultraland. Rumoured to be accompanied by a film of the same title, the album took The Isness' psychedelic experimentation and toned it down, giving the album a singular theme and sound, and replacing the more bizarre moments with funk and ambient interludes. The album was ignored by the press, but was received more favourably among fans than its predecessor. Unlike The Isness, which featured almost 100 musicians over the course of it and the various alternative versions and remix albums, Alice in Ultraland featured a fairly solid band lineup throughout, which extended to live shows which the band had undertaken away from the ISDN cables from 2005 onwards.

...song form has just become too limited. And when I say 'psychedelic', it's not a reference to 60s music but to the basic outlook of a child, which we all have. I think this is the only salvation now. Dance music taught us how to use the studio in a new way, but we have to now take that knowledge and move on with it. This stuff, electronic music, is not dead. It's a process that is ongoing. We have to take hold of the past and go forward with it...

5.1 & digital experimentation
The FSOL moniker re-appeared in 2006 with a piece entitled ""A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static"", intended as an experiment in 5.1 Surround Sound and created for an exhibition at the Kinetica art museum entitled, appropriately, ""Life Forms"". The piece contained reworked material from their archives and newer, more abstract ambient music. The piece was coupled with a video called ""Stereo Sucks"", marking the band's theories on the limitations of stereo music, which was released on a DVD packaged with issue 182 of Future Music Magazine in December 2006 and on FSOL's own download site in March 2007.
They also moved into creating their own sounds when they began constructing electronic instruments, the result of which can be heard on the 2007 release Hand-Made Devices. At their website Glitch TV (where the motto is ""[A] sudden interruption in sanity, continuity or programme function"") they sell and explain their devices such as the ""Electronic Devices Digital Interface"" glitch equipment.

FSOLdigital and the Archives
In 2007, the band uploaded several archive tracks online, for the first time revealing much of their unreleased work and unveiling some of the mystery behind the band. The old FSOL material, including the previously unreleased album Environments, along with a selection of newer experiments, the 5.1 experiments and a promise of unreleased Amorphous Androgynous psychedelic material, was uploaded for sale on their online shop, FSOLdigital.com.

The FSOLdigital platform has performed very well – we are delighted that people still dig us – we dig you all too.
In early March 2008, the band released a new online album as Amorphous Androgynous entitled The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness, which they describe as ""A collection of psychedelic relics from The Amorphous Androgynous, 1967–2007"". The release retains the sound of their last two psychedelic albums, while expanding on the element of funk first introduced on 2005's Alice in Ultraland. They recorded their following album, The Woodlands of Old, under the alias of their imaginary engineer Yage. Unlike the techno work recorded as Yage in 1992, this new record was darker, more trip hop and world music-oriented and featured ex-Propellerheads member Will White.
From 2008, the band showcased a series of radio broadcasts and podcasts called The Electric Brain Storms, originally on stations such as Proton Radio, PBS radio in Australia, and Frisky Radio. The remaining shows appeared on the band's official site. and SoundCloud. The shows featured electronic, krautrock, experimental and psychedelic favourites of the band mixed in with known and unknown FSOL material, including newly recorded tracks, archived pieces, and new alias recordings. Many of the new tracks appeared on the band's Environments series. Cobain has described the new music as having ""the introspective, kind of euphoric sadness that was always there in the FSOL melodies"".
From this point, the band have been alternating their focus between different projects. In 2008, Environments II and From the Archives Vol. 5 were released on the band's site, followed by Environments 3 and From the Archives Vol. 6 in 2010; and Environments 4 and From the Archives Vol. 7 in 2012. Whilst the Archives feature old, unreleased material, the Environments albums feature a mixture of old demos, recently completed, and new tracks.
The band have continued to use the FSOLDigital platform to release side-projects and solo work, under names such as Blackhill Transmitter, EMS : Piano, Suburban Domestic and 6 Oscillators in Remittance, as well as distributing digital releases from other artists, including Daniel Pemberton, Herd, Kettel & Secede, Neotropic, Ross Baker and Seafar; they also continue to update The Pod Room with ISDN transmissions from the 1990s.

A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind
Following on from the band's 1997 DJ set of the same name, a series of Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind mix CDs were begun in 2006. The first two were released under the Amorphous Androgynous alias, subtitled ""Cosmic Space Music"" and ""Pagan Love Vibrations"", with the first taking over two years to compile, mix and gain sample clearance, both featuring the band's psychedelic influences. A third is set for release sometime in 2010, and will be more electronic, mixed by the Future Sound of London. Further mixes in the series are expected in the future, to be curated by related artists, and the band took the concept live with an eleven-hour spot at 2009's Green Man festival, to contain live bands and DJ spots.
Noel Gallagher of British rock band Oasis, after hearing the first release, became a fan and asked the band to remix the following Oasis single ""Falling Down"". The Amorphous Androgynous responded with a 5 part, 22-minute Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble remix, which Noel liked enough to release on its own 12"". Noel also invited Cobain to DJ at the afterparty for one of Oasis' gigs at Wembley Arena.
The band continue the psychedelic theme to the mixes on their podcast site The Pod Room and on February 2010s Mojo Magazine cover CD. The Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble remixes grow in popularity with commissions from Paul Weller and Pop Levi, and Cobain has suggested a full album of remixes and covers will appear on their recently formed Monstrous Bubble label
On 6 July 2011 it was announced that Noel Gallagher's second solo album would be in collaboration with The Amorphous Androgynous, and was set for release in 2012. In August 2012, Gallagher mentioned in various interviews that he was considering scrapping the collaborative album with Amorphous Androgynous due to not being completely satisfied with the mixes. Two songs from the project have surfaced as B-sides to Gallagher's singles in 2012: ""Shoot a Hole into the Sun"" (based on Gallagher's track ""If I Had a Gun..."") was a B-side to the single ""Dream On"", and a mix of ""AKA... What a Life!"" featured on the B-side of ""Everybody's on the Run"". However, as the project was shelved in November 2012, the group have returned to original material, releasing the first in a series of Monstrous Bubble Soundtracks, entitled The Cartel. On Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds' album Chasing Yesterday, The Amorphous Androgynous are credited as Co-producers of the tracks ""The Right Stuff"" and ""The Mexican"".

Recent work
With the freedom of working independently from a record label, the group have remained prolific, working on multiple projects at once. Since 2014, the majority have releases through FSOLDigital have been of newly recorded material, with Environment Five being the first in the series to feature all new tracks. Since then, FSOL releases have been less conventional, with Environment Six being split over three volumes, named Environment Six, Environment 6.5 and Environmental, the latter part of a triple LP release called Archived : Environmental : Views. Similarly, Environment 7 is planned as a trilogy, the first volume released for Record Store Day 2022 under the name Rituals. In a move further from traditional structures, several albums have been released under the banner FSOLDigital Presents, including yearly Calendar Albums, presented to subscribers as a track each month, and mix albums as part of the A Controlled Vista and Mind Maps series. FSOLDigital has also been used as a publishing outlet, with books exploring the artwork and history of the band, each combined with a music package; a series of A6 books entitled The Ramblings of a Madman was also produced, with the accompanying download EPs later repackaged into an album entitled Music for 3 Books. Alongside books, the band have further explored multimedia, including a series of digital artwork releases as NFTs on Foundation and a pair of synthesisers created in collaboration with Digitana, the SX-1 and the HALia, the former being manufactured as of July 2018, the latter still in pre-production. A series of re-recordings of older tracks, combined with new remixes and related material, was released between 2018 and 2021 for Record Store Day, in place of conventional reissues; the reissue series so far features My Kingdom Re-Imagined, Yage 2019, Cascade 2020 and We Have Explosive 2021.
As well as The Future Sound of London, Dougans and Cobain have also revisited older side-projects. Dougans's solo project Humanoid has been active again since 2014, releasing the albums Built by Humanoid and 7 Songs as well as a string of EPs. Meanwhile, Cobain, in collaboration with Dougans and new co-producer Enrico Berto, began work on new Amorphous Androgynous material, with a double album of versions and remixes of the track ""We Persuade Ourselves We Are Immortal"" appearing in 2020. Alongside contributors such as Paul Weller, Ray Fenwick and Brian Hopper, the release features lead vocals by Peter Hammill, who is also credited on the album cover. Further alias releases have included albums released under the Blackhill Transmitter and Synthi-A names, as well as collaborations with Ross Baker and Daniel Pemberton.

Independence
Since the millennium, FSOL took a more independent turn with their career, releasing their more psychedelic Amorphous Androgynous on an independent label, The Isness on Artful Records and Alice in Ultraland on the progressive Harvest Records (an arm of EMI). They also have their own label called Electronic Brain Violence on which off-beat electronic artists such as Oil and Simon Wells (Headstone Lane) have released EPs and singles. Simon Wells also contributed to Dead Cities on the track ""Dead Cities Reprise""
Nevertheless, Virgin records still controls FSOL's back catalog and was going to release the Teachings from the Electronic Brain compilation without them, but the duo insisted on taking control of the production of the project. Cobain says that, even with Virgin, the reason they were able to do their own thing and create the music they wanted in the 1990s was because they already had some major hits under their belts such as ""Papua New Guinea"", ""Metropolis"" and ""Stakker Humanoid"" before joining the label.

Why is it, everybody, from the fucking fish and chip shop to a magazine ends up selling itself, getting the millions and retiring. Why don't people keep going with it, why can't they change it so that it keeps being important to them. Why didn't Anita Roddick keep going with Body Shop, why did it get so alien to her that she had to sell it, why? Surely she's making so many millions she can get the right people that she loves to keep going with the ethos; there's something dangerous there.
Cobain has said that FSOL's mentality has always been about making a journey of an album rather than focusing on trying to have hit singles. He said that they had several top 40 singles (and albums) in the 90s because they had enough fans and had built up enough of a reputation to achieve these hits while still concentrating on the album rather than any potential singles during their time at Virgin.
They have been signed to Passion Records sub-label Jumpin' & Pumpin' since they started out.

Gary Stadler,"Gary Stadler is an American new-age pianist, composer, songwriter and producer, specializing in contemporary Celtic-influenced themes and atmospheres. Stadler's six albums generally focus on imaginative concepts loosely based in Celtic mythology, especially stories of the realm of Faerie.  His music combines melodic elements of rare world instruments, mastery of synthesizer orchestrations and studio techniques. Three of his albums feature collaborations with vocalists Singh Kaur, Stephannie and Wendy Rule.
Stadler's third album, Fairy Heartmagic was listed on Billboard's New Age Top 25 chart for four weeks in year 2000.  Several of his songs have been featured on compilations on multiple record labels in the USA and Europe.
Stadler is the brother of professional golfer Craig Stadler.

Background and artistic development
Stadler knew at an early age that music would play a major role in his life. In school, in his hometown of San Diego, he learned to play the piano and most of the other instruments in the orchestra. When asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he always replied, ""I want to be an orchestra conductor!""
In 1993 he wrote two songs, ""Dream Spell"" and ""Awakening"", for a play produced and performed in San Diego entitled The Goblin's Bride, based on Celtic myths of the realm of Faerie.  Those songs were the genesis of his first album, Fairy of the Woods,  released by Sequoia Records in 1996, and well received by the alternative market of independent New Age bookstores.
Stadler found a loyal audience who stayed with him as he added vocals and moved into a more acoustic direction on his second album released in 1998, Fairy NightSongs, featuring the lyrics and exquisite voice of recording artist Singh Kaur, already known to New Age listeners for her Crimson Series of  recordings featuring harpist Kim Robertson.
For his third record, Stadler collaborated with Stephannie, a young vocalist and songwriter with a unique talent — by recalling her dreams she composed lyrics in a form of glossolalia she referred to as a new language of Celtic fantasy. Joined by the well-known Celtic harpist Lisa Lynne, Stadler's third album, Fairy HeartMagic,  was released on Sequoia Records in October 2000, recognized on Billboard's New Age Top 25. The song Fairy NightSongs from this album was awarded JPF Best New Age/World song of 2004 following its appearance on a compilation. This was the first of Stadler's CD to be enhanced with a CD-ROM session that offers two bonus songs in MP3 format and additional artwork for computer display.  All of Stadler's later albums featured similar enhancements.
Stadler's fourth album, Reflections of Faerie, in 2003 returned to instrumental pieces reminiscent of his first release but with a deeper and more intimate feel, mostly solo piano, with some featured harp artistry of Lisa Lynne.   In 2004, for his fifth release Deep Within a Faerie Forest, Stadler collaborated with singer/composer Wendy Rule of Australia. This recording once again delves deep into the depths of the mystical Faerie realms with intriguing lyrics and unusual instrumentation.  His sixth album, Faerie Lullabies was a retrospective produced in 2006 in which he chose the most peaceful and comforting pieces from his earlier releases and re-recorded them in the form of instrumental lullabies, intended for both children and their parents.
Stadler's song ""Fairy of the Woods"" was featured on the sound track of A Magickal Life: Jeff McBride, produced and broadcast by Canada's VisionTV, a one-hour episode of their series Enigma True-Life Stories in January 2006.  His former wife Tamara contributed lyrics to his albums as well as the albums of fellow Vegas Vortex musical group Zingaia, also featured in the same documentary program.

Album artwork
The artwork on the first two of  Stadler's six albums was created by San Diego artist Scott Thom, known for his original airbrush paintings coveted by collectors and his line of New Age greeting cards. Las Vegas artist Katlyn Breene of Zingaia (who also wrote some of the lyrics on Fairy NightSongs and Fairy HeartMagic) created the artwork for Stadler's remaining albums.

Broad interests
In addition to his musical talents, Stadler's interests and skills are widely varied.  He has spent the majority of his business life as an electronics design engineer with emphasis on laser system design.  His love for automobile mechanics won him 1st place in the San Diego Plymouth Troubleshooting contest, continuing on to win 4th place in the national Plymouth Troubleshooting contest. His interests include technical and historical glassblowing — he currently specializes in the manufacture of distillation equipment for essential oils.  He is known for his expertise in stage lighting and laser art (one of his first careers), producing ""wet"" light shows and laser light shows in the 1970s and 1980s, owning and operating an electronic design/manufacturing company from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, and winning a Technical Achievement Oscar for innovations in the film lighting industry in 1994. More recently, he has used these skills in the creation of innovative temporary art installations at the Burning Man festivals, events produced by the Vegas Vortex, and stage magic productions of Jeff McBride.

Despite the majority of his production work takes place at his Metatron Studio in London, he is a busy live performer and spends a large proportion of his time touring – performing to theaters, clubs and festival audiences around the world. His career started in the early 1980s, his musical foundations were set in electronic music, post-punk and reggae.

Biography
Early career (Italy 1981–1995)
Gaudi's career started in 1981 in his native country Italy as a keyboard player for new-wave bands such as: Wild Planet, Red Light and Violet Eves, the latter band playing an important role in the Italian underground music scene combining electronica, post-punk and traditional Italian melodies. A few years later he joined the reggae band Bamboo Company which whom spent 5 years and developed his skills as a reggae music producer.
In the mid-1980s, Gaudi started to gain recognition in the underground music scene for his works as a keyboardist with bands such as: The Gang -on the album 'Barricada Rumble Beat', 1985-, Disciplinatha -on the album Abbiamo pazientato 40 anni, ora basta, 1987- and Violet Eves.
With three members of the Bamboo Company, Gaudi founded Raptus, one of the first Hip Hop act using Italian lyrics, releasing the 12in single ""Peggio della colla"" in 1986 on Multimedia Attack Punk Records and being subsequently spotted by Italian rocker Vasco Rossi and his production team Terryball which produced their next single. While expectations for the project were high, unfortunately exposure was low and the band split.
In 1987, Gaudi began his first solo project as a solo singer with the name Lele Gaudi, creating what was to become the first 'Raggamuffin' album written in Italian. In 1988 the album was finished however record companies were uneasy with the concept of an untried formula and unwilling to take the risk of releasing it. Gaudi spent the next 2 years meeting record labels to find an appropriate deal. During this period he also spent time in Jamaica, testing his project and getting valuable feedbacks for the quality of his work.
With producers Ricky Rinaldi aka Ohm Guru and Frank Nemola, Gaudi founded Tubi Forti, a production team soon to become fairly established in the indie circuit for their works with: Isola Posse All Stars -for their 12in single 'Stop al panico'-, Sud Sound System, -for their 12in debut single 'Fuecu'-, Donatella Rettore -for her single 'Zan Zan Zan' and more. With this production team, Gaudi also released a number of 12in singles on Irma Records as: National Rare Groove (singles 'Lets Dance' and 'Talking To You'), Dr Muff & Crazy Stuff (single 'Don't Forget This'), 4t Thieves (single ‘Etnotechno’), the latter being Gaudi's first experiment with world music fused with electronica.
Two years on from the initial knock-backs, Gaudi signed his first major record deal with Polygram/Universal for his solo project as Lele Gaudi, he flew to London for the recording of his first 12in single 'Maliniconico Love' featuring Crucial Robbie, recorded at Jah Tubby's Studio. The single's official videoclip gained major exposure and heavy rotation on MTV resulting in an immediate success in Italy.
Gaudi's debut album Basta Poco was released in 1991 followed by a solid exposure by the medias and participation to numerous TV shows on the Italian national TV RAI, culminated with the winning of his first award by RAI as ""Best Italian New Coming Act 1991"".
His second 12"" single '1990 Anni Fa' was released later in the year by Polygram/Mercury Records and was promptly banned from Vatican City due to its 'sensitive content', needless to say this did nothing to harm record sales.
For the 2 years tour that followed the success of the album, Gaudi was backed by reggae band WDX.
In 1993, Gaudi added his signature to a collaboration with socially conscious Italian singer Ricky Gianco, an artist well known for his upfront social commentary. The exposure gained from this project firmly established Gaudi as a household name.
The same year he collaborated with Francesco Baccini for a raggamuffin vocal part on his single 'Lei sta con te', produced by Glezos.
Pulling together previous music influences, Gaudi started experimenting with a new music instrument, the Theremin, combining its ethereal electronic sound with dub and psychedelic music, resulting with the release of a number of 12in singles under the moniker Dub Alchemist.

Career in London, 1995–present
In 1995 Gaudi moved to London and set up 'Metatron Studio London', founded the record label 'Sub Signal' and the production team “Terra Terra” in partnership with DJ Angelino. The duo produced several remixes including their 1996 No.1 UK dance chart 'Jus come' by Cool Jack, released on AM:PM Records.
Gaudi then signed with Harmony Management and established his career as a remixer, working for named pop acts such as: Mansun for their single 'Taxloss' which at no.14 in the UK, Mazzy Star for their single 'Roseblood', Cast for their track 'History' which charted at no.2 in the UK, Peter Andre for his single 'AllAbout Us' which charted at no.3 in the UK, then Africa Bambaataa, Rebbie Jackson, Jeanie Tracy, Love City, L.A Believers, Kinobe, New Clear Family and more. 

The first Gaudi's full-length studio album entirely produced in his studio in London was Sound of Anatomy, an ambient concept album released under the moniker Ultraviolet Zero, in collaboration with multi-instrumentalist Pauli Atzei. 
in the following two years Gaudi composed music for BBC, Channel 4, RAI, ITV and many soundtracks and jingles for MTV. It was for MTV that Gaudi composed the music for the Europe Music Awards 1998, becoming then a popular anthem, resulting with the release of the 12in single Cadillac Kitsch, with the moniker Mad Master Moog. Followed by popularity of his composition in relation with TV shows, Gaudi started to create music also for commercials, such as: Sony PlayStation, Longines, Fiat, Seat, Energie, Fiorucci and The Express.
In 1998 he wrote the song ""Non ti Scrivero"" for Italian popstar Irene Grandi, featured on her double platinum selling album Per Fortuna Purtroppo.
Still in the same year, Gaudi's third album Earthbound was released on a triple vinyl by Bustin Loose Recordings, giving him worldwide sales recognition and a solid exposure that led to his tracks appearing on numerous compilations.
Earthbound contains music influences ranging from Indian ragas to African chanting and from Jamaican chatting to Italian traditional melodies, its one unifying factor being the flavors of reggae and dub.
The album featured 39 musicians from around the globe, including Jamaican raggamuffin star General Levy, Indian singers Kiren Sambhi and Sonal Varsani, Sardinian voice virtuosos Tenores di Neoneli, Trio Cocco and Antonio Testa who provided the track Stalagmite, recorded in a cave playing natural stalagmites.
The dub version of Earthbound, titled ‘Earthbound in Dub’ was also released later that year on Sub Signal.
In 2000, Gaudi took a trip to Africa and spent some time in Burkina Faso experiencing the lifestyle and culture of the indigenous communities, there he recorded a number of African musicians for his next album, Bass, Sweat & Tears.
Year 2000 also saw the beginning of the four years collaboration with world-music exponent DJ Pathaan, the duo named themselves 'Orchestral World Groove' and got residencies at prestigious London venues such as Cargo, Fabric, Dogstar, Plan B and Redstar. The duo released tracks on many compilations worldwide and toured internationally, performing at high-profile venues and festivals such as Roskilde in Denmark, Skol Beat in Brazil, The Big Chill and Gatecrasher in England.
2003 started with Gaudi remixing the song 'Soul Shakedown Party' by Reggae icon Bob Marley, followed by 'The man who sold the world' by Simple Minds (song written by David Bowie) and subsequently working on Jim Kerr's single Innerworld, released with the moniker ‘Pascal Life’.
With classical composer Massimo Nunzi, in 2004 Gaudi composed a symphonic/jazz interpretation of Shakespeare's The Tempest for a 20 piece orchestra infused with live electronic dub elements and Theremin played by himself. Major exponents of the European jazz scene such as Gianluigi Trovesi, Mederic Collignon, Gianluca Petrella, Paolo Damiani, Ada Montellanico and Italian pop singer Niccolo Fabi were part of the project which culminated with two high-profile concerts at Roccella Jonica Jazz Festival and at the Villa Borghese in Rome.
In the same year Gaudi teamed-up with French inventor/engineer Michel Moglia and his music instrument The Fire Organ (Orgue A Feu), a 20-ton metal pipe structure that works with fire. The duo composed ‘Elemental’, an opera for Fire Organ and Theremin which resulted in a spectacular double performance at the Colosseum in Rome to an international audience of more than 350,000.
Gaudi's 5th solo album Bass, Sweat & Tears, was released in 2004 by Canadian label Interchill Records and gained an immediate success becoming the label's best selling release to date.[3]. Considered by the press ""ground-breaking and influential"" the album reached notable sales recognitions and charted at #2 in the iTunes European chart and at #32 in the iTunes USA chart. Songs from it were featured in over 70 compilations and licensed for movies such as: Pooja Bhatt's Bollywood films noir Rog and Fareb by Vikram Bhatt, while the track 'Chant Thermique' featured on the film 'Let It Ride' (about the life of legendary snowboarder Craig Kelly) won the Award as ""Best Soundtrack"".
The following year, Gaudi wrote the hit singles 'Lasciala Andare' and 'Lady Picche', for Italian singer Irene Grandi included in her platinum-selling album Indelebile (WEA). Lasciala Andare topped the Italian chart at #2 and stayed for 16 consecutive weeks. The song was subsequently included in the platinum sales album collection 'Irene Grandi - Hits (Atlantic 2007)' and the double live album Lasciami Andare. The success of the song continued for several years and expanded also into the Greek market, with Eleonora Zouganeli covering it in Greek language (renaming it ""Fevgo gia mena mia fora"") and topping the Greek charts for several weeks.

In 2006, ambient music pioneer Pete Namlook invited Gaudi to his studio Klanglabor Hodeshof in Germany to compose the collaborative album Re:sonate, released then on Fax Records.

Giulio Aldinucci,"Giulio Aldinucci (born in 1981 in Siena) is a composer known for his work in the realm of experimental electroacoustic music. His research on soundscape and use of archival material demonstrates how the interplay between the past and the present can evoke memories and emotions through their temporal qualities. Through his use of field recordings Aldinucci, captures “the natural” by preserving the uncontrolled sounds that occur in our environment, and “the artificial” through the manipulation of these sounds.
He composed eight albums released by the labels Karlrecords (D), 99chants (D), Home Normal (UK/J), Time Released Sound (USA), Dronarivm (RUS) and Nomadic Kids Republic (UK/J). Furthermore, he made six EPs and seven collaborative albums with Enrico Coniglio, The Star Pillow, Ian Hawgood, Francis M. Gri, Francesco Giannico and Pleq published by Midira (D), Home Normal (UK/J), KrysaliSound (I), Dronarivm (RUS) and Eilean (F).
In addition to his contribution to various collective works, he wrote music for theatre, video art and cinema. His music is featured in many compilations, including Sound at Work – electronic music and labour created by Tempo Reale, the Italian electronic music research centre founded by Luciano Berio, and the special edition of The Wire Tapper that celebrates the 50th issue with a selection from the series' 20 year back catalogue, among others.

Biography
Giulio Aldinucci was born in Siena (Italy) in 1981, he began composing in his teenage years. Aldinucci has a musical and an academic linguistics background. In 2001 he started the project Obsil (the word Obsil stands for ""observing silence""): under this name, he released three albums between 2006 and 2011. His first album, Tarsia, was released in August 2012 by the Anglo-Japanese label Nomadic Kids Republic (Home Normal sister label).
In June 2013, taking their cue from Gianmarco Del Re’s column on Fluid Radio, which profiles the most interesting sound artists and musicians currently operating within the Italian electroacoustic scene, Giulio Aldinucci and Attilio Novellino translated the Postcards from Italy project into an album published on CD by Oak Editions, a live event at Cafe Oto and a special installation at SoundFjord Gallery by AIPS collective & Gianmarco Del Re. The Italian presentation of the Postcards From Italy project took place at Spazio O' in Milan on 1 February 2014. The Postcards from Italy album was included on the 2013 ""Top Ten Field Recording & Soundscape"" by A Closer Listen.
His third album, Spazio Sacro (“Sacred Space” in English), was released in 2015 by the North American label Time Released Sound released.
The seven tracks that compose Spazio Sacro are characterized by field recordings taken in places that are related to the idea of “sacred” in different ways. The starting point is a reflection on how human rites define new soundscapes (e.g. processions, architecture of churches and cathedrals or ruins of isolated mountain sanctuaries). The audio material has been manipulated and the music has been written in a constant dialogue with the artist's personal memories, especially those from childhood, when in his area (a small village in Tuscany, Italy) religious rites still marked the pace of the community life throughout the year.
His fifth album Borders and Ruins was released by Karlrecords in 2017. The album is a reflection on the instability of borders - borders as an extreme attempt to discriminate and rationalize that turns into a source of chaos and cultural ruins on both sides - and their impact on the relationship between people and territory. It is also a sonic diary focused on this relationship.
His composition Mute Sirens was awarded with an honourable mention at the 18th International Electroacoustic Composition Competition Música Viva 2017.
His sixth album Disappearing in a Mirror was released by Karlrecords in 2018 on vinyl and cd. This work shows a peculiar approach on ambient drone music. Where its predecessor Borders and Ruins was a reflection on the instability of borders, Disappearing in a Mirror raises the very personal question of identity. The album focuses on the fluidity of the identity concept, highlighting the harmonious coexistence of contradictory elements and the transitional features that characterize every transformation. It is a reflection on the current situation of change and disruption and at the same time it is a gaze into the human timeless soul and its inner soundscapes.
His eighth album Shards of Distant Times was released by Karlrecords in 2020 on vinyl and cd. As Shards of Distant Times is the third album Giulio Aldinucci has recorded for Karlrecords, one might consider the set a triptych. Borders and Ruins was an incredibly timely work, appearing in the early days of Brexit and Trump’s wall, while 2018’s Disappearing in a Mirror examined the more inner borders between “the self and the world.” Shards of Distant Times looks at the porous membrane between past and present while simultaneously tackling the internet as sound. This work album explores the liminal areas of the contemporary soundscape that are characterized by the presence of human voice coming from old and timeworn recordings. Like in the auditory pareidolia, the psychological phenomenon in which the mind hears indistinct voices in random noise where none exist, voices and music emerge from the everyday soundscape through the omnipresent internet connected devices, creating glitches between time and space.

Goldfrapp,"Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesiser) and Will Gregory (synthesiser).
Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 début studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synth-pop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album's dance-oriented sound was carried over to their third album, Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards.
Their fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synth-pop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the folktronica-influenced Tales of Us, in September 2013. Goldfrapp released their seventh studio album, Silver Eye, in March 2017, which debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart. The same position was achieved by Alison Goldfrapp's May 2023 debut solo album  The Love Invention.

1999: Formation
Alison Goldfrapp began her musical career performing with Dance Company Catherine Massin throughout the Netherlands during her early twenties. Afterwards, she attended Middlesex University, where she studied fine art and started creating live performance pieces.  In the early 1990s, Goldfrapp served as a guest vocalist with the electronic band Orbital and trip hop artist Tricky. In 1999, she was introduced to composer Will Gregory after he listened to an early version of the song ""Human"". Gregory and Goldfrapp felt a mutual connection and wrote the track ""Lovely Head"". Following several months of phone calls, they decided to form a band and began performing under the name Goldfrapp.
In August 1999, Goldfrapp signed a recording contract with London-based record label Mute Records. They recorded their debut album over six months, beginning in September 1999, in a rented bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult, as they were disturbed by the mice and insects in the bungalow.

2000–2002: Felt Mountain
Goldfrapp's début album Felt Mountain was released in September 2000 and produced the singles ""Lovely Head"", ""Utopia"", ""Pilots (On a Star)"" and ""Human"". It featured Alison Goldfrapp's vocals over cinematic soundscapes and is influenced by a variety of music styles including cabaret, folk and electronic music. The album was well received by music critics, including Pitchfork Media who described its sound as ""simultaneously smarmy and seductive, yet elegant and graceful"". It reached number 57 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2001, Felt Mountain was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year.
The lyrics on Felt Mountain were written by Alison Goldfrapp and are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films and her childhood. The song ""Oompa Radar"" was inspired by Roman Polanski's film Cul-de-sac, while ""Pilots"" describes travellers floating in the atmosphere above the earth.
To promote Felt Mountain, Goldfrapp toured the U.K., Europe and North America, supporting the alternative music bands Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Doves. The band found it difficult to perform songs from the album live because of their complex arrangements which required up to forty musicians. They eventually settled on performing with violinist Davide Rossi, drummer Rowan Oliver and keyboardist Andy Davies.

2003–2004: Black Cherry
Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry was released in April 2003. The band recorded the album in a darkened studio in Bath, England. The album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Alison Goldfrapp commented that the album differed from Felt Mountain because the band ""felt that we really didn't want to repeat what we had done...we kind of wanted to do something that felt equally as fresh to us as the first one felt fresh to us, and we wanted to put more kind of ""oomph"" in it."" The album received positive reviews from critics. The Guardian found it to be an ""unexpected delight"" and About.com called it a ""rare electronica album of warmth and depth...the ultimate chillout pleasure"". Black Cherry peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States. It sold well, reaching platinum status in the UK and selling 52,000 copies in the U.S. as of August 2006.
The first single released from the album was ""Train"", which reached number 23 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's lyrics discuss obsession and overindulgence and were inspired by Goldfrapp's visit to Los Angeles while touring in support of Felt Mountain. ""Strict Machine"" was released as the album's second single. The song proved successful on several formats, and reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2004, ""Strict Machine"" won an Ivor Novello Award for ""Best Dance Single"". The third single released from Black Cherry was ""Twist"", a song inspired by a fantasy that Goldfrapp had about a boy who worked in a fairground. The title track was released as the album's fourth single and reached number 28 in the UK.
In 2003, Alison Goldfrapp modified her image, from a sophisticated Marlene Dietrich inspired look to that of a new wave diva. The reinvented image included false eyelashes, customised T-shirts, military uniforms and fishnet stockings. Starting in March 2003, the band toured the album, with a concert series entitled Black Cherry Tour. In 2004, the band further toured Australia, Japan, Europe and North America and embarked on the Wonderful Electric Tour. Sections of the stage show featured Goldfrapp in a white dress wearing a horse tail and dancers with deer heads, and were inspired by Goldfrapp's interest in animals and mythology.

2005–2006: Supernature
Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature débuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and ""Ooh La La"" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013.
""Ooh La La"", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single ""because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album"". ""Ooh La La"" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. ""Number 1"" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single ""Ride a White Horse"" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. ""Fly Me Away"" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.
In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of ""Satin Chic"", the band's favourite song from the album.

2006–2008: Seventh Tree
Goldfrapp began writing and recording their fourth album, Seventh Tree, at the end of 2006 in Bath, England; released in February 2008, it débuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album is a departure from the pop and electronic-dance music featured on Supernature, and features ambient and downtempo music. The band were inspired by an acoustic radio session they had performed, which led the duo to incorporate acoustic guitars into their music to create ""warm"" and ""delicate"" sounds.
The album's lead single, ""A&E"", reached number ten in the UK. The single received positive reviews from critics: musicOMH found it to be ""a beautifully paced ballad"" and Digital Spy called it ""lush, folky and organic"". ""Happiness"", the album's second single, reached number 25 in the UK. The third single, ""Caravan Girl"", which describes the story of a girl that suffers from amnesia, reached number 54 in the UK.
In 2008, Alison Goldfrapp took inspiration from the character of Pierrot and English Folk. The artwork for Seventh Tree featured her dressed as a clown because it is an ""iconic image"" with ""so many different connotations"". Goldfrapp chose to tone down her overtly sexual image because she felt that it was taking over the music. Her new image, inspired by Paganism, featured her dressed in white or natural-coloured flowing gowns with loose, curly blond hair.

2009–2012: Head First and The Singles
Goldfrapp's fifth album, Head First, was released in March 2010. Recorded over a six-month period, it was a return to the dance oriented sound on previous albums. The album took inspiration from 1980s pop music and bands such as Van Halen and The Pointer Sisters. Alison Goldfrapp described its sound as ""optimistic and vibrant."" The album received positive reviews from critics, with Allmusic describing it as ""a love letter to the frothy, fleeting, but very vital joys of pop music."" Head First peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart and number 45 on the US Billboard 200. The album earned Goldfrapp a Grammy Award nomination in 2011 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and ""Rocket"" was nominated for Best Dance Recording.

The album's first single was ""Rocket"", a song about an unfaithful lover. Musically, The Times and Spin have compared the song to ""Jump"" by American rock band Van Halen. In the US, ""Rocket"" peaked at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. ""Alive"" was released as the album's second single. The song's music video featured Alison Goldfrapp as a 1980s inspired aerobics instructor who leads a group of black metal fans and vampires through a fitness routine. The album's third single ""Believer"" featured remixes by Vince Clarke and Davide Rossi.
In February 2012, Goldfrapp released the compilation album The Singles. The album contained previously released material as well as two newly recorded songs.

2013–2014: Tales of Us
In mid-June, Goldfrapp announced their forthcoming sixth album, Tales of Us, to be released 9 September 2013. The album features ten tracks. All the track titles, with the exception of ""Stranger"", are given people's names. Goldfrapp confirmed via Twitter that the sound of the album focuses on their softer sounds similar to that of their début piece Felt Mountain as well as their 2008 release Seventh Tree. Accompanying this announcement was the re-launch of the duo's website which features a trailer video directed by Lisa Gunning with the first dates announced for their Tales of Us Tour. ""Drew"", the first single from the album, was released on 2 September 2013 with an accompanying film directed by Gunning, the first of five films subsequently released to promote the album. Preceding the album's release, Goldfrapp performed the album in its entirety with a 24-piece orchestra and choir over two nights at the Manchester International Festival. Tales of Us was nominally successful upon release, charting in the top 20 in over 15 countries. In March 2014, the Tales of Us worldwide cinema event took place, featuring the full Tales of Us film and a live performance from Air Studios in London. Further singles from the album included ""Annabel"" and ""Stranger"".

2015–2018: Silver Eye
In July 2015, Alison Goldfrapp announced on Twitter that the group had returned to the studio to work on music for the forthcoming seventh album, but as far as a release date she could only state it would be ""sometime in 2017"". in December 2016 Goldfrapp posted on their Instagram page the covers of their first six studio albums. On 23 December 2016 Goldfrapp posted an image of two topless figures holding each other's heads, with bleached blonde hair covering their faces, and a black substance slicked across their forearms, along with the hashtag #goldfrapp7. The social media upload was initially assumed to be the seventh album's cover art. This turned out not to be the case. The title of the album was confirmed as Silver Eye. The first track to be played from the album, titled ""Anymore"", was premiered on Lauren Laverne's BBC 6 Music show on 23 January 2017. Silver Eye was eventually released on 31 March 2017. Silver Eye: Deluxe Edition was released on 6 July 2018. This was the original Silver Eye album with an additional eight remixes, including a collaboration with Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode on the track ""Ocean"".
In September 2021, Goldfrapp were awarded the Ivor Novello inspiration award, which celebrates ""peer recognition for the excellence of Goldfrapp songwriting catalogue and in particular how it has inspired the creative talent of other creators"".

Musical style
Although Goldfrapp's musical style has changed over time, they are considered to be an electronic music act. Goldfrapp has explored a range of musical styles in their songs, although many songs are characterised by Alison Goldfrapp's distinctive breathy, soft soprano vocals and Will Gregory's multi-layered synthesiser / string arrangements. Pitchfork described Goldfrapp's voice as ""a cross between Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, between Annie [Lennox] and Siouxsie Sioux, between Rachel Stevens and Beth Gibbons"".

Album style and genre progression
The band's sound has progressed from electronic in Felt Mountain, through synth-pop in Black Cherry to a more glam rock-influenced sound in Supernature, and to a blend of ambient, folk, and electronic sounds in Seventh Tree and a 1980s synth-pop influence in Head First. However, they have experimented with other genres of music, such as cabaret (""Cologne Cerrone Houdini"", ""Human"", ""Oompa Radar""), operatic pop (""Utopia"" and ""Pilots""), folktronica (""A&E""), and trip hop (""Little Bird"" and ""Lovely Head"").

Musical, cinematic, and other inspiration
Alison Goldfrapp listened to Kate Bush, Prince, T. Rex, Donna Summer, and Iggy Pop and The Stooges as a teenager. In the early 1990s, while working in Belgium and travelling Europe, she discovered Serge Gainsbourg, 1970s Polish disco music, and Weimar cabaret. Gregory's musical background was in classical music and he has cited Ennio Morricone as his main influence. Other media, including film, have influenced Goldfrapp; Alison Goldfrapp cites Roman Polanski's psychological thriller Cul-de-sac and the cult film The Wicker Man as influences. 
They also draw inspiration from surrealism and nature, both of which are reflected in the band's album artwork, which Goldfrapp designs in collaboration with Big Active.

Collaboration and composition technique
All the band's songs are composed jointly by Goldfrapp and Gregory, although they have collaborated with Nick Batt on several tracks. They have called their writing relationship a ""democracy"", playing off one another while in the recording studio. While writing, Goldfrapp uses her vocals to create melodies and drumbeats. Gregory composes on vintage keyboards. The band believe that ""music is a visual experience"" and often visualise their songs before writing them.

Hammock (band),"Hammock is an American ambient post-rock duo formed in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2005 by Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson. 
Hammock have released 10 albums and five EPs since 2005, mostly on their own label, Hammock Music, which is distributed through Secretly Distribution, and have garnered favorable reviews from critics, including Pitchfork and AllMusic.

History
Formation and first releases
Hammock was formed in Nashville, Tennessee, by Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson, both former members of the alternative rock band Common Children. After the band split in 2001, the pair continued to write, record, and produce together in their free time. Byrd was a songwriter for EMI Records, a job which he disliked and left him feeling burned out creatively. He started to visit Thompson at his house, where they started ""messing around"" with ambient music that they had wanted to produce for some time at his basement studio named Studio 37. The style of music was similar to the music the pair were listening to for pleasure, and ""so far removed"" from what they were used to working on which provided a refreshing and new direction. Byrd said: ""We didn't really see it turning into anything other than just good musical therapy."" Before long the pair had recorded between 20 and 40 tracks from these informal sessions which prompted them to release the material, thinking others might enjoy the music. The band acquired its name when Byrd was hosting a party at his house, and told his friends that he and Thompson were stuck for names. A friend noticed his hammock in the garden and suggested it, which stuck. Byrd said: I didn't think of hammock, like the lazy beach. I thought of it more like, looking at the stars.""
In March 2005, music written and recorded from these initial sessions over a two-and-a-half year period was released on Hammock's debut album, Kenotic. The record was written and recorded intermittently across a two-and-a-half year period, and self-released by the band. The enthusiastic response to the album took them by surprise. This was followed by the EP Stranded Under Endless Sky four months later. The band published their website with quotes, poems, and external links to content that they thought fit with their music. At the end of 2005, the webzine Somewhere Cold voted Hammock Artist of the Year on their 2005 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame list.
Hammock's debut live performance was at Chuck Dodson's Gallery@404B in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on August 3, 2007, at the after-party of an event to honor the Icelandic artistic duo Jónsi & Alex. The band wrote all new music purposely for the gig, and used loop pedals so the two could perform alone. The material was the basis of their third studio album Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow, named after a piece of art by Jónsi & Alex who agreed to produce the cover art for it. The album was recorded live in its entirety, save for a few overdubs. In 2008, Hammock performed at the Wordless Music Series in New York City with fellow ambient duo Stars of the Lid.

2010–2016
In May 2010, Hammock released their fourth album Chasing After Shadows...Living with the Ghosts. The group wanted a change in musical direction as they developed a new fanbase with the previous album, so they incorporated orchestral arrangements and fuller instrumentation on their new material. Hammock said the change was ""a natural progression ... that's the voice you have to follow"". They amassed 50 potential tracks for the record, using what fit its overall mood the best. That December, Hammock released their fourth EP, Longest Year, a beatless and wordless mini-album that was born out of the difficulty the band faced in 2010, including the near-total destruction of Byrd's home in the 2010 Tennessee floods. By the end of that year, Hammock had performed just twice in Nashville.
Over the next few years, Hammock expanded their musical horizons with a variety of collaborations and the addition of more of an orchestral aspect to their music. Hammock collaborated with singer-songwriter Matthew Ryan on the single ""Like New Year's Day"", released on January 1, 2011. On March 8, 2011, the band issued a cover of Catherine Wheel's ""Black Metallic"" as a digital single, featuring vocals by Byrd's wife, Christine Glass (the couple had previously collaborated as a duo, GlassByrd). On October 5, 2011, they released a four-song collaboration EP with Steve Kilbey and Tim Powles of the Church called Asleep in the Downlights.
On July 6, 2012, Hammock announced that mastering had started for their sixth LP and first double album, Departure Songs. It was released on October 2, 2012.
On May 10, 2013, they announced that they had begun mixing a new record, Oblivion Hymns. The album was released on November 26, 2013, and was a notable departure from their previously guitar-focused sound, adding a neoclassical element with a full orchestra, children's choir, and vocals from Timothy Showalter (Strand of Oaks).
On July 1, 2014, Hammock reissued their fully ambient 2005 album The Sleep-Over Series (Volume 1), following it up with a sequel, The Sleepover Series, Volume 2, on September 23, 2014.
Hammock's ninth album, Everything and Nothing, was released on April 1, 2016. Irish music and politics magazine Hot Press said in its review that the album is ""the aural equivalent of a flotation tank... an album to lose yourself in completely"". Haydon Spenceley, reviewing for Drowned in Sound, stated that the album has ""clarity, purpose, drivenness, even, not words that would necessarily be associated with this stellar band's earlier work... This is music of transcendent beauty, but with an added level of dissonance that grabs the attention in a way that hasn't ever seemed to be Hammock's stock in trade before"". Spenceley also claimed that Everything and Nothing is Hammock's ""most immediate, most sonorous and beautiful album to date"".

2017–present
On June 21, 2017, Hammock announced via their Facebook page that their 10th album, Mysterium, would be released on August 25, 2017. They also released a video of the first single, ""Things of Beauty Burn"". In 2018, Hammock released the follow-up to 2017's Mysterium with the album, Universalis. In 2019, Hammock released the follow-up to 2019's Universalis with the album, Silencia, thus concluding their self proclaimed ""trilogy"" 
In 2017, Hammock composed the score for Kogonada's critically acclaimed film Columbus, which premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.
In 2018, Hammock released an album, We Will Rise Again, that ""reimagined"" work composed by Dan Romer for the 2017 videogame, Far Cry 5.
In 2020, Hammock released a remaster of their 2010 EP, Longest Year, with a physical release as well as new album artwork.
In 2024, Hammock released the album A Hopeful Sign in collaboration with American rock band Yellowcard – a collection of 9 pre-existing Yellowcard songs re-interpreted with new instrumentation by Hammock.

Other projects
Since 2005, Byrd has occasionally recorded as a member of the band the Choir.
Hammock guested on the track ""Melting the Frozen Sea Within Us"" by Amman/Josh, which appeared on that band's 2010 EP Places.
Hammock collaborated with Matthew Perryman Jones in 2013 on the song ""Unknown"", released as part of the Nashville Indie Spotlight 2014 compilation album.
Building on their 2011 collaboration with Matthew Ryan, Hammock announced a side project named the Summer Kills in March 2018. After seven years of work, the trio's first album, Last Night We Became Swans (mixed by Peter Katis) was released on April 27, 2018.

Hans-Joachim Roedelius,"Hans-Joachim Roedelius (born 26 October 1934) is a German electronic musician and composer, known as a co-founder of the influential 'kosmische' groups Cluster and Harmonia. He is notable for his prolific discography either as himself, as part of a band, or in collaboration with other artists. He has more than 100 releases with his name.
He also performed in the ambient jazz trio Aquarello, and released several solo studio albums.

Biography
Early life
Roedelius was born on 26 October 1934 in Berlin in the family of a dentist. He was an unwilling member of the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth, membership being mandatory for all boys from the age of ten, and appeared in several propaganda films (Faded Melody by Viktor Tourjansky in 1938 ; Riding for Germany by Arthur Maria Rabenalt in 1941). Roedelius and his mother Gertrud were evacuated from Berlin to a small hamlet in East Prussia. In his book Future Days: Krautrock and the Building of Modern Germany, David Stubbs writes that ""the aftermath of the war was most difficult for the Roedelius family"" who didn't have ""enough to live on and just a bit too much to die on"". He served two years in prison after the war when he attempted to defect from East Germany. Before managing to escape over the border into West Berlin in 1961, he had worked as a physical therapist and masseur. Soon thereafter he gave up his day job to pursue a career in music.

Kluster, Cluster and Harmonia
In 1968 Roedelius co-founded the music commune known as ""Human Being"" and co-formed Zodiak Free Arts Lab, the center of Berlin's Underground Culture at the time, with conceptual artist Conrad Schnitzler. He met Dieter Moebius at the Zodiak. In 1969 Roedelius, Schnitzler and Moebius formed Kluster. In 1971 Schnitzler left the group to start a long-running solo career and Moebius and Roedelius anglicised the band's name to Cluster. They signed first to Philips then to Brain.
In 1973 Roedelius and Moebius worked with Neu! guitarist Michael Rother under the name of Harmonia. Musik Von Harmonia was released on the back of a huge publicity campaign by Brain. Harmonia released one further album, 1975's Deluxe. Rother also co-produced the 1974 Cluster album Zuckerzeit. British musician Brian Eno, a fan of both Cluster and Harmonia, joined them for several jams, the result of which was released in 1997 as Tracks and Traces. Rother left Harmonia to pursue his solo career and Cluster returned to the studio to record Sowiesoso which was released on Sky Records. Brian Eno later worked on two albums with Cluster: 1977's Cluster & Eno and 1978's After the Heat, the latter of which gained the band much attention in the British music press. A further Cluster album produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann Großes Wasser extended Cluster's music into long form.

Solo career
Roedelius' solo career began with Durch die Wüste in 1978 and then Jardin Au Fou in 1979. The first of the lengthy Selbstportrait series was released in 1979, being material done beside  his work with Cluster and Harmonia, without the input of his collaborators. Mostly recorded on simple two-track equipment, the Selbstportraits make up the backbone of Roedelius' early solo recordings. Leaving Sky in 1982, his work took a more new-age style as he signed to Virgin's Venture sub-label. During this period, his best selling solo album Geschenk des Augenblicks – Gift of the Moment was released.
He was dropped by Venture in 1989 and began releasing on a variety of small labels.
Sinfonia Contempora No. 2: La Nordica (Salz Des Nordens) was released in 1996. Also released in this period was Selbstportrait VI: The Diary of the Unforgotten, the first of the modern Selbstportraits. Now, rather than merely remastering the seventies tapes, Roedelius also played over them, the sound montage Homage á Forst samples many Harmonia and Cluster tracks into the mix.

21st century
The turn of the century was Roedelius' most productive year, with no fewer than eight albums being released between 2000 and 2001. Reprising the Selbstportrait series for the seventh time in 2000, Roedelius composed entirely new tracks for the first time on Selfportrait VII: dem Wind voran – ahead of the wind. The new millennium also saw Roedelius begin to work with other, usually younger, musicians than he had done since the late eighties.
In the meantime, Cluster had reformed. 1990's Apropos Cluster was an update for the band, being a work of avant-techno not dissimilar in style to Großes Wasser. In 1996 Cluster embarked on two international tours, one of Japan and one of America. Cluster reunited again in 2007.
In November 2010 it was announced that Cluster had split up for the third time. In the official announcement, the split up was described as Moebius leaving the group. In the wake of this news, Roedelius announced that he was beginning a new project called Qluster, to follow on from Cluster and Kluster. The band is made up of Roedelius and accomplished electronic musician Onnen Bock with third member Armin Metz and released a trilogy consisting of ""Rufen"", ""Fragen"" and ""Antworten"" (Calling, Asking and Answering) in 2011.
His autobiography, The Book – The Autobiography of Hans-Joachim Roedelius, was published in 2018.
In March 2021 Roedelius launched his official website and in April he performed his first free surprise live stream concert on YouTube.

Harmonia (band),"Harmonia was a West German musical ""supergroup"" formed in 1973 as a collaboration between members of two prominent krautrock bands: Cluster's Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius joined by Neu! guitarist Michael Rother. Living and recording in the rural village of Forst, the trio released two albums—Musik von Harmonia (1974) and Deluxe (1975)—to limited sales before dissolving in 1976. AllMusic described the group as ""one of the most legendary in the entire krautrock/kosmische scene.""
In 1997, a series of shelved 1976 collaborations between Harmonia and British musician Brian Eno saw release as Tracks and Traces; it was reissued with more unearthed material in 2009. Following the release of the live album Live 1974 (2007), the trio reformed between 2007 and 2009. In 2015, Grönland Records released the 6-disc box set Complete Works, featuring remastered recordings and archival material.

History
Formation: 1973-1975
In 1971, the duo of Moebius and Roedelius, members of Cluster, moved to the rural West German village of Forst near the Weser River after being offered residence in several centuries-old farmhouses by an antiquarian who hoped to establish an artist's commune there. Michael Rother put his project Neu! on hold in early 1973 to meet with Roedelius and Moebius, hoping they might act as a backing band for live Neu! performances. Upon jamming with the duo, Rother claimed that ""it was sort of a musical love at first sight, really [...] it was just something I hadn’t experienced before. In good moments, the three of us could produce a real, live music."" Together the trio recorded in their own home studio in Forst, and chose the name Harmonia partially as a joking reference to the common German phrase for ""choir."" The idyllic, natural surroundings would influence their work.

They recorded two albums under the name Harmonia: Musik von Harmonia in 1974 and Deluxe in 1975, both released on Brain Records. The former was produced by Harmonia themselves using a primitive mixer and three tape recorders. After its release and a period on tour, Rother took a short break from Harmonia to record the third Neu! album with Klaus Dinger, Neu! '75 (1975) in order to complete his contractual obligations. In his absence Cluster recorded Zuckerzeit (1974), with Rother credited as co-producer. The band's second album Deluxe saw producer Conny Plank co-produce with a 16-track recording machine and mixing desk, and featured live drumming by Guru Guru member Mani Neumeier. Deluxe emphasized Rother's rock and pop sensibility over Cluster's more improvisational approach, which led to some creative tension between the members.

Collaboration with Eno: 1976
After the release of Deluxe, Harmonia went back to touring until Roedelius, Moebius and Rother ended their collaboration in summer 1976. All three members started solo projects but rejoined as Harmonia in September 1976 when Brian Eno visited them in Forst for 11 days, living and recording with Harmonia before proceeding to collaborate with David Bowie on his 1977 albums. Eno brought along a four-track recorder and a VCS3 synthesizer. The material for Tracks and Traces was not released until 1997 because the tapes were long considered lost.
Eno has stated that Harmonia was ""the world's most important rock band"" in the mid '70s, Eno had joined Harmonia once live in 1974, jamming with the group at The Fabrik in Hamburg. David Bowie considered Harmonia one of the most important and influential German bands of the era.

Reformation: 2007-2009
Harmonia reunited in 2007 following the release of their album Live 1974, a recording of their concert of 23 March 1974 at Penny Station Club in Griessem, Germany. Rother, Roedelius and Moebius performed live as Harmonia for the first time since 1976, opening the Worldtronics Festival at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, Germany on 27 November 2007.
Musician, writer, and rock historian Julian Cope places both albums in his Krautrock Top 50. The trio also toured and a new recording drawn from this period, Live 1974 was released on the UK-based Grönland Records label on 22 October 2007 and the San Francisco  based Water Records label in the United States on 11 December 2007.
Harmonia made their first live appearance in the UK on 18 April 2008, playing on the opening night of the Ether Festival in the Queen Elizabeth Hall at Southbank Centre, London. In July 2008, the band also headlined the final day of the Supersonic Festival in Birmingham.
Harmonia further appeared at the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in the UK in May 2008, at the Numusic festival in Stavanger, Norway, at an edition of ATP curated by My Bloody Valentine in New York in September 2008 and at the Australian series of the festival, curated by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in January 2009.
In September 2009, an extended version of Tracks and Traces was released by Gronland. The new album features three additional tracks from the Harmonia & Eno ´76 collaboration. Tracks and Traces Remixed, an album composed of remixes followed in 2010.
Dieter Moebius died in July 2015.
In October 2015, Grönland Records released the 6-disc vinyl boxset Complete Works. The box included all three studio albums, Live 1974 and Documents 1975; a collection of 2 live tracks and 2 early versions of Deluxe LP album tracks. Documents 1975 was released as a separate CD and vinyl-LP in March 2016. Documents 1975 had been released as a cassette prior to the Complete Works boxset in September 2015.

Style and influence
According to AllMusic, the work of Harmonia was borne out of ""relaxed, improvisational jam sessions that wedded Cluster's exploratory space music with the chugging rhythms and guitar sense of Rother."" Uncut named their two studio albums as ""among the best Krautrock had to offer, gentler than Can or Faust, but with their shimmering keyboards and mechanical rhythms, every bit as compelling. Pitchfork labeled them ""a key krautrock band because they brought together the most familiar strands of the sound and effectively perfected the whole,"" calling attention to their hybrid of electronic and rock instrumentation, long-form structures, and steady rhythms.
AllMusic writer John Bush described Harmonia as ""one of the most legendary in the entire krautrock/kosmische scene."" Collaborator Brian Eno described them in the mid-1970s as ""the world's most important rock group."" Harmonia's work would influence the development of ambient music by Eno and albums by David Bowie, as well as other electronic and rock acts.
According to Pitchfork, ""copies of their records found their way into some famously open-eared and influential fans in the UK—Eno and Bowie, among others—and Harmonia’s music has been part of the experimental rock canon ever since."" Harmonia continued to influence Brian Eno's work after their collaboration. Their work, according to critic Alex Abramovich,  helped to lay the foundation ""not only for ambient music but for generations of blues-less rock bands, from Wire and New Order to My Bloody Valentine.""

Harold Budd,"Harold Montgomory Budd (May 24, 1936 – December 8, 2020) was an American music composer and poet. Born in Los Angeles and raised in the Mojave Desert, he became a respected composer in the minimal music and avant-garde scene of Southern California in the late 1960s, and later became better known for his work with figures such as Brian Eno and Robin Guthrie. Budd developed what he called a ""soft pedal"" technique for playing piano, with use of slow playing and prominent sustain.

Early life
Budd was born in Los Angeles, California, and spent his childhood in Victorville, California on the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert. 
Harold was only 13 when his father died, and soon his family fell out of their comfortable middle class existence. He was sent up to the desert to live with friends and relatives as often as possible, but the reality in Los Angeles was growing up in a tough neighborhood, and as the oldest son, being the man of the house. During this time Black culture had an enormous impact on Harold, especially jazz music and bebop, and he could be found in his teenage years playing drums in bars and jazz clubs in South Central Los Angeles.
Drafted into the army, he joined the regimental band where he played drums at Presidio of Monterey (POM). Jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler was drafted at the same time and was also a member of the band. Budd joined him in gigs around the Monterey area. Budd's experience of the army made him determined to get an education.

Education, academic career and early works
Budd attended high school at Los Angeles High School, but did not graduate. He worked as ""everything from cowboy to mailman,"" including a stint at Douglas Aircraft. At the age of 21, he left Douglas, and briefly moved to San Francisco. While there, he worked at Gump's. Unable to continue living in San Francisco, Budd returned to Los Angeles, and enrolled in an architecture course at Los Angeles City College. He switched to a course in harmony  and renaissance counterpoint and his musical talent was spotted by a teacher who encouraged him to compose. He began to attend performances by artists like Chet Baker and Pharoah Sanders.
“From that moment on,” he recalls, “I had an insatiable appetite. Harmony, counterpoint, Renaissance music: I really heard it for the first time.”
Budd's career as a composer began in 1962. In the following years, he gained a notable reputation in the local avant-garde community. Budd studied music at California State University, Northridge, under Gerald Strang (a protege of Arnold Schoenberg) and Aurelio de la Vega. He graduated from CSUN, and then went on full scholarship to the University of Southern California, under the tutelage of Ingolf Dahl, graduating in 1966. Budd's work of this period was primarily minimalist drone music influenced by John Cage and Morton Feldman, as well as the abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko, with whom he corresponded.
After completing his degree in composition in 1969, Budd took up a teaching position at the California Institute for the Arts. In 1970, he released his first piece, The Oak of the Golden Dreams, which he recorded with an early model Buchla modular synthesizer at the institute.
At the encouragement of Brian Eno and Marion Brown, he left CalArts for London. Soon afterwards, Budd gave up composition, disgusted by the ""academic pyrotechnics"" of the avant-garde community. 
In London, he found his composing community of Eno, Gavin Bryars, Michael Nyman, and the members of the Cocteau Twins.
In 2004, Budd and his wife moved to Monument House in Joshua Tree, California.

Composer and recording artist
The road from my first colored graph piece in 1962 to my renunciation of composing in 1970 to my resurfacing as a composer in 1972 was a process of trying out an idea and when it was obviously successful abandoning it. The early graph piece was followed by the Rothko orchestra work, the pieces for Source Magazine, the Feldman-derived chamber works, the pieces typed out or written in longhand, the out-and-out conceptual works among other things, and the model drone works (which include the sax and organ Coeur d'Orr and The Oak of the Golden Dreams, the latter based on the Balinese 'Slendro' scale which scale I used again 18 years later on 'The Real Dream of Sails').
In 1972, while still retaining his teaching career at the California Institute for the Arts, he resurfaced as a composer. Spanning from 1972 to 1975, he created four individual works under the collective title The Pavilion of Dreams. The style of these works was an unusual blend of popular jazz and the avant-garde. His 1972 work Madrigals of the Rose Angel was sent to English composer Gavin Bryars who passed it on to Brian Eno. Eno contacted Budd and brought him to London to record for his Obscure Records label.

I owe Eno everything, OK? That's the end of that... I was plucked from the tree, and suddenly I had flowered. I was just waiting. I couldn't do it on my own. I didn't know anything.
Budd resigned from the institute in 1976 and began recording his new compositions, produced by Eno. Two years later, Harold Budd's debut album, The Pavilion of Dreams (1978), was released.  The first performance of the piece was at a Franciscan church in California conducted by Daniel Lentz.""
The work with Eno led Budd to shift his focus to studio-led projects, characterised by use of synthesisers and electronic treatments, often collaborating with other musicians. Budd developed a style of piano playing he deemed ""soft pedal,"" which can be described as slow and sustained. While he is often placed in the Ambient category, he emphatically declared that he was not an Ambient artist, and felt that he got ""kidnapped"" into the category.
His two collaborations with Eno, 1980's The Plateaux of Mirror and 1984's The Pearl, established his trademark atmospheric piano style. On Lovely Thunder, he introduced subtle electronic textures. His thematic 2000 release The Room saw a return to a more minimalist approach. In 2003, Daniel Lanois, a producer for U2 and Bob Dylan, and occasional collaborator with Brian Eno, recorded an impromptu performance of Budd playing the piano in his Los Angeles living room, unaware; it was released in 2005 as the album La Bella Vista.
He had a long-running collaboration with guitarist Robin Guthrie. They worked together initially when Budd worked with Guthrie's band Cocteau Twins on their 1985 collaboration The Moon and the Melodies. The record was released by 4AD under all the collaborator's names (rather than being a Cocteau Twins/Harold Budd record), with Budd being listed first as it was an alphabetical listing. In November 1986, the record charted on the UK Top 75 album chart, spending a week at number 46. Budd and Guthrie subsequently released several albums together, including two soundtracks to the Gregg Araki films Mysterious Skin (2004) and White Bird in a Blizzard (2014), with the last, 2020's Another Flower, recorded in 2013 but only released four days before Budd's death.
Budd also collaborated with Andy Partridge of XTC on the album Through the Hill (1994), John Foxx on the album Translucence/Drift Music (2003) and work with Jah Wobble on the Solaris concert and live album in 2002.
He composed music for the score of the 2020 miniseries I Know This Much Is True.

Reception
Brian Eno called Budd ""a great abstract painter trapped in the body of a musician"".
The Guardian said, ""The core Budd sound of yearning piano motifs and reverb-laden impressionism is often called minimalism. But compared with the cyclical craft of Steve Reich and early Philip Glass, his low-key, expansive forays felt deftly maximalist. This has made Budd's craft synonymous with the dreamworld. An heir to Satie and Debussy, his music was treated and poetic, never kneejerk nor incautious.""

Death
Budd was undergoing therapy at a short-term rehabilitation facility after suffering a stroke on November 11, 2020. It was there he contracted COVID-19 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in California. He died from complications of COVID-19 at a hospital in Arcadia, on December 8, 2020. He was 84.

Detailed New York Times obituary"
Henrik Takkenberg,"Henrik Takkenberg (August 23, 1967 – November 25, 2006) was a lead singer, songwriter, composer and producer who developed a new musical style he named Flamenco Chill.

Biography
He was the producer and a [1] member of the Spanish group Chambao (Sony BMG) and produced Cathy Claret on the album Sambisarane (Subterfuge Records). The fusion of electronic ambient sounds with Flamenco, transformed the interpretation of this traditional Spanish music and met with popular success.
His profound knowledge of ethnic, classical and electronic music were influenced by his Asian and Japanese Language and Literature Degree studies at Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan in the Associated Kyoto Program exchange with Connecticut College. There, he studied the Shakuhachi and medieval Japanese notation from 1988 to 1989 with Nakao Tozan, director of the Shin-Tozan-Ryu School of Shakuhachi, daughter of the founder.
He worked at the National Sound Archive in London as assistant to Dr. Janet Topp Fargion and updated the archive records on Japanese music and also documented the Lesotho music collection at the International Music Collection Department. This allowed him to further his research into Native American, African and Japanese traditional music.
He worked at the Japan Society in New York City in the Film, Theatre and Music Department, and was Assistant Stage Manager to Toru Takemitsu at the New York International Festival of the Arts in 1990. Back in London at the Beat Factory studio he managed Fruithouse Records with Sonia Cristina from Curved Air, and assisted producer Graeme Holdaway on projects such as Salad and Transglobal Underground.
With the support of Thomas Brooman and Peter Gabriel, Takkenberg and the members of his band ""Bass Camp"", performed at the WOMAD World Music and Dance Festival in 1995 where he recorded with Vernon Reid of Living Colour, Joe Strummer of The Clash, Mark Rutherford, and Ayub Ogada. He also worked with Kevin Locke and Pow Wow of the Lakota-Sioux Nation, Sôzan Chiaki Kariya from Japan, and Purna and Paba Das Baul from West Bengal, composing a Real World compilation release featuring them, and Ali Farka Toure from Mali.
He received a diploma from Trinity College, London in Music Composition for Film before joining M62. His Work for Orange, ""Future Thoughts"" together with Max Richter, directed by Ridley Scott, and recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Snell, was finalist at the British Television Advertising Awards in 1998. He made tracks for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (Young & Rubicam), Drug Free America (RSA), Nintendo (Leagas Delaney), Nike (RSA), Shell Ferrari, Marlboro, BMW, Het Parool in the Netherlands (Kesselkramer), (Saatchi & Saatchi) and others.
The desire to be with his family pulled him to Spain, where on the beaches of Málaga, he struggled to get Chambao off the ground. He introduced them to Sony BMG, and got them a five-record deal. Irreconcilable differences forced him to leave the band, while still maintaining a close relationship with Daniel Casan, the band's songwriter.
He then settled in Madrid, where he set up Magik Sound Productions, producing the critically acclaimed record for Cathy Claret, ""Sambisarane"" with Subterfuge Records and various pieces for Café del Mar, including ""Espiral"" in the 25th anniversary edition. His studio shared with Hugo Westerdahl in Madrid allowed him to work with Eduardo Paniagua and Paco de Lucía.

Early life
Takkenberg was born to Frits Takkenberg and Renate Takkenberg-Krohn on August 23, 1967 in Bogotá, Colombia. His mother is a photographer and his father was on the board of directors of Holland Chemical International (HCI Chemicals B.V.). In Bogotá he learned to play the Tiple (18 string small guitar) and the piano at the age of nine. The family moved to Spain in 1977 where his interests in music were encouraged further at Runnymede College in Madrid. After the divorce of his parents, he leaves for boarding school in England in 1982.
At Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, he fell on fertile ground for rock bands and met kindred minds with a taste for life. Rugby union and the bands Early Birds, Flat Hat, Crosstalk, Red Shift, Dirty Boots and Earth Hum, from 1985 to 1995, formed his ideas on friendship and loyalty. His school trip to Nepal became an experience that would transform his view on the world and fire his interest in eastern philosophy, culture and music. He attached great importance to the conciliatory and spiritually enriching value of music and its ability to make us forget frontiers and ""dance together as equals"".

Obituary (Spanish)"
Hirokazu Tanaka,"Hirokazu ""Hip"" Tanaka (田中 宏和, Tanaka Hirokazu, born December 13, 1957), also known as Chip Tanaka, is a Japanese musician, composer, sound designer, and executive who pioneered chiptune music. He is best known as one of Nintendo's in-house composers during the 8- and 16-bit era of video games. Tanaka also had a role in designing and programming the Famicom and Game Boy audio hardware, along with the NES Zapper, Game Boy Camera, and Game Boy Printer.
Tanaka's soundtrack credits include Metroid (1986), Kid Icarus (1986), Super Mario Land (1989), Tetris (1989), Mother (1989), Dr. Mario (1990), and EarthBound (1994). He was the president and executive director of Creatures from 2001 to 2023, before resigning and becoming creative fellow in the company.

Biography
Early life
Born to a schoolteacher mother who had Tanaka undergo piano lessons, Tanaka recounted that he first began paying serious attention to music while in elementary school, and attempted to form a band during that time. His first band was formed when he was in middle school, a Beatles and Elton John cover group, which sometimes performed concerts at his school. He has held a longstanding obsession with reggae music. In his teens, he was also in a reggae band, which was known variously by the names the Shampoos or Roots Rockers. For the music event ""Reggae Sunsplash"" held in Osaka, the Shampoos were an opening act for Sly and Robbie on more than one occasion. Tanaka did meet the duo during those times. On The Shampoos, Tanaka described it as an obscure local band which did gigs in Tokyo about once or twice a year, and that it was ""never a formal thing"".

Employment at Nintendo
In 1980, after graduating from university with a degree in electronic engineering, Tanaka successfully applied for a job at Nintendo as a sound designer. He did not initially want to be an engineer, but Nintendo were accordingly scouting for ""different sounds or toys or something at the time. I thought toys would be relatively stress-free, so I applied."" The first game Tanaka worked on was Space Firebird (1980), where Tanaka was composer and constructed a new sound chip for particular sound effects. Following this, Tanaka worked on Donkey Kong (1981), providing the sound effects for Mario's footsteps and jumps. Usually, the same sound effect was repeated across many different actions, but Tanaka's approach differed where he invented subtle variations. He attempted to insert voice synthesis for the game's damsel-in-distress, but the idea was vetoed by then-Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi's daughter, who did not feel that the sample sounded like the exclamation ""help me!"". Tanaka noted that he learned ""a lot"" from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto due to his perfectionism and ""level of commitment"".
Donkey Kong 3 (1983) was the first game where Tanaka acted both as composer and sound effects designer. His approach to game composition carried on from his dub obsession: ""For instance, if you listen to the music in Wrecking Crew (1985), you could recognize that some parts are drum and bass only. So that turned out to be an idea for working around the limitations of the game software. I figured that, to get the most out of the game music, a dub-based structure would be a really great solution. I'd play the melody in some parts, then cut it off and insert a part with just drums and bass, and vice versa. No one else was doing it, but it was what I wanted to do."" Tanaka described what he remembered as a ""typical day"" at Nintendo in the brief period following the release of the Famicom home game console:

Everything just stayed the same. From morning to night, we made new circuits and developed software. We had computers for work but they were TTY devices; they had no monitors. Back and forth, morning to night. Sometimes designing hardware, and sometimes creating software. Back and forth, for me at least. ... I'd work from 9AM to as late as 2 or 3 in the morning. They didn't make us do it. It was just fun. We talk about the history of games, but for me, the history of games and computers overlap. If anything, I think it was more of the history of the evolution of computers ... I studied all about computers after I joined Nintendo. I think our generation of Nintendo employees were all the same. We learned as we went, built our own systems, and built them again. For instance, we made our own development tools. So everything was handmade. It was really fun. ... There was a continuous stream of new jobs and you'd go from one to the next.
While working full-time at Nintendo on two or three games a year, and sometimes two simultaneously, Tanaka continued playing gigs in Osaka and Tokyo with the Shampoos. Sometime in the late 1980s, they recorded the 45 rpm ""Thunder Dub"" which prominently sampled the opening drumbeat from the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)"" (1967). Tanaka did not personally see a difference between the music he composed for video games and the music he composed in his off time. For Metroid (1986), Tanaka acknowledged that games were becoming more complex, and his scores were becoming more like a film's, desiring in Metroid not to ""repeat the same game-melody cliches,"" although he recalls that the game's soundtrack was not well-received within Nintendo because of its dark atmosphere. He was inspired by the film Birdy (1984) to create a game score that was dark until the very end, where the player would finally receive music with a strong melody. Despite disapproval from his Nintendo colleagues, Tanaka was allowed full creative freedom on projects, and even had a fluctuating role in influencing some games' content and play style. He remembers Nintendo's strict, repeated criticisms over the amount of ""fun"" a game would have, but that there was no financial pressure in creating games, nor were there sales quotas to meet. At the time of Dr. Mario (1990), Tanaka began observing an increasing number of ""serious"" game composers who had graduated from music schools. Dr. Mario was thus the first time Tanaka had asserted his musical personality in a game.

Tanaka was one of ""about five or six"" Nintendo-based developers who designed the Game Boy, researching and creating its audio hardware. He was inspired to develop the Game Boy Camera from a product called ViewCam that was popular at the time — Tanaka also ran experiments on the possibility of watching television via the Game Boy.

Creatures Inc.
At the advice of EarthBound (1994) co-worker Tsunekazu Ishihara, Tanaka would join Creatures as a guest composer, where he would end up composing dozens of songs for the first Japanese Pokémon anime and various Pokémon promotional releases. Despite the fact that his themes were not used in the West, they inspired best-selling singles and albums in Japan due to their popularity there. Tanaka was eventually forbidden by Nintendo to continue to write more songs for the anime due to their policy of not allowing employees to work for other companies, so he resigned at Nintendo and joined Creatures full-time in 1999.
Tanaka succeeded Ishihara to become the president of Creatures in 2001, while Ishihara continued as CEO. Starting in the late 2000s, Tanaka began to perform at Japanese dance clubs under the name ""Chip Tanaka"". The moniker was suggested by a foreign acquaintance, as Tanaka thought ""Hip Tanaka"" was too attached to his time at Nintendo.
After the death of Satoru Iwata in 2015, Tanaka wrote a tribute track titled ""Dedicated to Satoru Iwata"". In April 2023, Tanaka announced he was stepping down as president and executive director of Creatures, but would remain as a Creative Fellow.

Influences
Tanaka has said that his tastes in his youth were typical of the time, listening to artists such as the Beatles and the Carpenters. His first exposure to dub music was through the 1978 album Negrea Love Dub by Linval Thompson while eating pasta at a restaurant with live music in Kyoto. It was the record's use of exaggerated tape delay which astounded Tanaka, who stopped eating every time he heard it occur: ""I thought 'Is this music sick?' But the more I listened to it, that groove with the bass line and the mixer... I think the mixer takes full control of it, directly and instinctively. When I felt it, I thought 'This is amazing.' I was totally hooked."" Tanaka explained his fascination with reggae music and his application for it in his game scores: ""It wasn't proactive on my part. I was a music lover that happened to be working at Nintendo. ... The reason I like reggae, especially dub, is because there actually is vocal and guitar on it, let's say, but in the essence, it's strictly driven by drums and bass. That's what I love about it the most. ... I think I like how there's this raw aspect to it. The gritty, raw quality of the sound, let's say. That really caught my ears. And that deep bass sound, the ""buuu..."" That was something I never heard before in rock music. It drove me like no other genre in music.""
Among specific musical influences, Tanaka has cited Brian Wilson, Randy Newman, Stackridge, Yabby U, the Flying Lizards, Prince, Lalo Rodriguez, My Bloody Valentine, Frank Zappa, Keiichi Suzuki, Hal Willner's various artists compilations, Sly Dunbar, Jah Wobble, and the Slits. The ""hip"" in ""Hip Tanaka"" came from hip hop, with his favorite artist of the genre being A Tribe Called Quest.: 1:12:45

Holger Czukay,"Holger Schüring (24 March 1938 – 5 September 2017), known professionally as Holger Czukay (), was a German musician best known as a co-founder of the krautrock group Can. Described as ""successfully bridg[ing] the gap between pop and the avant-garde"", Czukay was also notable for having created early important examples of ambient music, for having explored ""world music"" well before the term was coined, and for having been a pioneer of sampling.

Biography
Czukay was born on 24 March 1938 in the Free City of Danzig (present-day Gdańsk, Poland), from which his family was expelled after World War II. Due to the turmoil of the war, Czukay's primary education was limited. One pivotal early experience, however, was working, when still a teenager, at a radio repair-shop, where he became fond of the aural qualities of radio broadcasts (anticipating his use of shortwave radio broadcasts as musical elements) and became familiar with the rudiments of electrical repair and engineering.
Czukay studied music under Karlheinz Stockhausen from 1963 to 1966 and then worked for a while as a music teacher. Initially Czukay had little interest in rock music, but this changed when a student played him the Beatles' 1967 song ""I Am the Walrus"", a psychedelic rock single with an unusual musical structure and blasts of AM radio noise. This opened his ears to music by rock experimentalists such as The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa.
Czukay co-founded Can in 1968. He played bass guitar and undertook most of the recording and engineering for the group. Rosko Gee, former bassist of the British band Traffic, joined the band in 1977, with Czukay handling only tapes and sound effects on the album Saw Delight, his final LP with the group before departing for a solo career. Czukay had been sidelined due to creative disputes and his failure to progress as a bassist, admitting his shortcomings on the instrument which he had taken up ""almost by default"" in the early days of Can.
After his departure from Can, Czukay recorded several albums. One of his trademarks was the use of shortwave radio sounds and his early pioneering of sampling, in those days involving the painstaking cutting and splicing of magnetic tapes. He would tape-record various sounds and snippets from shortwave and incorporate them into his compositions. He also used shortwave as a live, interactive musical instrument (such as on 1991's Radio Wave Surfer), a method of composition he termed ""radio painting"". Czukay also stated ""If you want to make something new, you shouldn't think too far beyond one certain idea"".
Czukay collaborated with a considerable number of musicians, notably a series of albums with Jah Wobble and David Sylvian, two younger British musicians who shared his interest in blending pop music with experimental recording and sampling techniques. Other collaborators include U.N.K.L.E., Brian Eno, Eurythmics, and German Neue Deutsche Welle band Trio.
In 2009, after a problematic time with the record company that had been gradually re-releasing his albums on CD, Czukay began a new collaboration with the Claremont 56 record label, releasing vinyl-only remixes of tracks from earlier albums, as well as some new recordings. This approach changed Czukay's plans for his back catalogue, so that the original albums Der Osten ist Rot (1984), Rome Remains Rome (1987) and Moving Pictures (1993) are no longer being reissued (in the case of Moving Pictures, because the master tapes have degraded beyond repair). Instead, most of the tracks are being remade and newly organized as limited edition vinyl releases.
In 2018 it was announced that Czukay's work was being released in a box set, Cinema, including his solo works, collaborations, and unreleased material. It was released in March 2018.

Personal life
Holger Czukay was married for nearly thirty years to the German painter and singer Ursula Kloss (known professionally as Ursa Major, and later, as U-She), with whom he collaborated on numerous multimedia pieces. Ursula Schüring (as she was called after marrying Holger Schüring under his real name) died on her 55th birthday (28 July 2017) after having been severely debilitated by illness for over a decade.

Death
On 5 September 2017, Czukay was found dead in his apartment, converted from Can's old studio in Weilerswist, near Cologne. The New York Times reported that he had died on the same day, but the cause of his death was the subject of a police investigation. His death was eventually assumed to have been from natural causes.

Imogen Heap,"Imogen Jennifer Jane Heap ( IM-ə-jən HEEP; born 9 December 1977) is a British musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. Her work has been considered pioneering in pop and electropop music.
Heap classically trained in piano, cello, and clarinet starting at a young age. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and, while attending boarding school, taught herself music production. After being discovered by manager Mickey Modern while attending the BRIT School, Heap signed to independent record label Almo Sounds at the age of 18 and later began working with experimental pop band Acacia. She released her debut album, an alternative rock record, I Megaphone, in 1998. In early 2002, Heap and English record producer Guy Sigsworth formed the electronic duo Frou Frou and released their only album to date, Details (2002).
Her second studio album, Speak for Yourself, was released in 2005 on her own label, Megaphonic Records, and was certified gold in the United States and Canada. The album spawned three singles: ""Headlock"", ""Goodnight and Go"", which became her highest-charting single as a lead artist on the UK Singles Chart, and ""Hide and Seek"", which was certified gold in the United States and gained popularity after being used in the Fox teen drama television series The O.C.. Heap's third studio album, Ellipse (2009), peaked in the top five of the Billboard 200 chart and received mostly positive reviews. This was followed by her fourth studio album, Sparks (2014). In 2017, she reunited with Sigsworth as part of Frou Frou.
Heap developed the Mi.Mu Gloves, a line of musical gloves, as well as a blockchain-based music-sharing program, Mycelia. She also composed the music for the West End/Broadway play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Over the course of her career, she has received two Grammy Awards, one Ivor Novello Award, and one Drama Desk Award. In July 2019, Heap was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.

Early life
Imogen Jennifer Jane Heap was born on 9 December 1977 in Havering, Greater London. Her name was inspired by that of British composer Imogen Holst, as her mother wanted Heap to become a cellist like Holst. She played music from an early age, first learning the piano due to ""wanting attention"" as a middle child and realizing, according to her, that ""it was something [she] could make a lot of noise with"". She did not enjoy playing the music of classical composers such as Bach and Beethoven, and would instead attempt to play in their style to convince her parents she was practicing their music. As a child, she began recording music by recording herself playing piano on cassette, then recording herself again singing over it. She soon began taking lessons and became classically trained in several instruments including piano, cello and clarinet while attending Friends School, a private, Quaker-run boarding school in Saffron Walden. At around age 10, she began composing Christmas carols for her school's choir.
Due to being placed a year above children her age, Heap claims she did not get along with many people from the school and spent most of her time in the music room practising piano. She stated, ""In boarding school...I was mocked about the clothes I wore, the way I looked, whatever. People there really did regard me as some kind of freak from the middle of nowhere. And these things do matter a lot when you are sixteen, seventeen."" Heap's mother, an art therapist, and father, a construction rock retailer, separated when she was twelve years old. Also at age twelve, she taught herself how to use Cubase on an Atari computer at Friends School. By the age of thirteen, she had begun writing songs. At age fifteen, she began using reel-to-reel recording to record her music, using a home computer to program the music.

Career
1995–1996: Almo Sounds & Acacia
After boarding school, she went on to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, South London, where she first began regularly singing and writing songs due to loneliness. It was there that she recorded her first song to feature her vocals, ""Missing You"", which was released on the BRIT School's Class of 1994 album and earned her attention from manager Mickey Modern after he saw her performance at a talent showcase. After being introduced to Nik Kershaw by Modern, Heap recorded demos which were taken to Rondor Music. A few months later, Heap signed her first record contract, aged 18, with independent record label Almo Sounds.
In 1996, Heap began working with British experimental pop band Acacia, which featured her future collaborator Guy Sigsworth. While never a full member of the band, Heap was a guest vocalist and contributed to various Acacia singles and album tracks. Heap's first major live solo performance was as part of the line-up for the 1996 Prince's Trust Concert in Hyde Park.

1998–2001: I Megaphone
Heap's debut commercial single, ""Getting Scared"", was released in 1997 and included on the soundtrack for the 1998 horror film I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. She released her debut album, the alternative rock record I Megaphone, on 16 June 1998 through Almo, with ""Getting Scared"" as its lead single. The record was made with several producers, including English musician Dave Stewart and Sigsworth, and received some critical praise but was a commercial failure, as Almo did little to promote the album. Soon after Heap released the record, Almo Sounds was acquired by Universal, forcing its artists to either move to other labels or be released. Heap was one of the artists who was dropped from the label, leaving her without a record contract.
During her time as an unsigned artist, Heap appeared on two singles: ""Meantime"", a track written by her former Acacia colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film G:MT – Greenwich Mean Time, and ""Blanket"", a 1998 collaboration with British hip hop band Urban Species. ""Blanket"" was Heap's first charting single, reaching number 56 on the UK Singles Chart. The song would later appear in a 2005 sex tape of Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Heap appeared as a featured vocalist on two songs—""Dirty Mind"" and ""Rollin' and Tumblin'""—on the 2001 album You Had It Coming by English guitarist Jeff Beck.

2002–2003: Frou Frou
Heap had kept in contact with Guy Sigsworth (who had co-written and produced ""Getting Scared"" from I Megaphone), and this led to the pair of them establishing the collaborative project Frou Frou.
The initial concept for Frou Frou was Sigsworth's, and the project was to have been an album written and produced by her with each track featuring a different singer, songwriter, poet or rapper. Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition – that she include the word ""love"" somewhere. The first line she came up with was ""lung of love, leaves me breathless"", and the Details album track ""Flicks"" was written. A week later, Sigsworth called Heap again, and together they wrote and recorded the future single ""Breathe In"".
On 4 June 2002, they released Details, their first and only album to date. The album spawned the singles ""Breathe In"", ""It's Good to Be in Love"" and ""Must Be Dreaming"". The song ""Let Go"" was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film Garden State.
In late 2003, after an extensive promotional tour of the UK, Europe and the US, the duo was told that their record label Island Records would not be picking up the option for a second album.
Heap and Sigsworth remain firm friends and have worked together since the project, including their temporary re-formation in late 2003, when they covered the Bonnie Tyler classic ""Holding Out for a Hero"" which was featured during the credits of the movie Shrek 2 after Jennifer Saunders' version in the film. Frou Frou saw a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when their album track ""Let Go"" was featured in the film Garden State, the soundtrack of which won a Grammy award.
In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou, ""[It] was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and spontaneous – just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together.""

2004–2007: Speak for Yourself
In December 2003, Heap announced on her website that she was going to write and produce her second solo album, using her site as a blog to publicise progress.
Heap recorded a rendition of the song ""I'm a Lonely Little Petunia (In an Onion Patch)"" for the seventh episode of the fourth season of the HBO drama series Six Feet Under, which premiered in August 2004. Her rendition later appeared as the album closer for the 2005 soundtrack album Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends.
Heap set herself a deadline of one year to make the album, booking a session to master the album one year ahead in December 2004. She re-mortgaged her flat to fund production costs, including renting a studio at Atomic Studios, London (previously inhabited by UK grime artist, Dizzee Rascal), and purchasing instruments.
At the end of 2004, with the album completed, Heap premiered two album tracks online, selling them prior to the album's release – ""Just for Now"" and ""Goodnight and Go"".
In May 2005, Heap released the lead single from her forthcoming album, ""Hide and Seek"". The song earned immense popularity after being used to score the season two finale of the Fox television series The O.C. on the same day as its release. It peaked in the top-40 of the Billboard Digital Songs chart, eventually receiving a gold certification from the RIAA and going on to be sampled in the song ""Whatcha Say"" by American singer Jason Derulo, which topped the Billboard Hot 100.
Heap released the album on her own label, Megaphonic Records. The album was titled Speak for Yourself. Speak for Yourself was released in the UK on 18 July 2005 on CD and iTunes UK, where it entered the top 10 chart. The initial 10,000 physical copies pressed sold out, distributed through large and independent record stores and Heap's own online shop. In August 2005, Heap announced that she had licensed Speak for Yourself to RCA Records for the album's release in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The album was released in November 2005 and débuted at number 144 in the Billboard Top 200 album chart. In concert, Heap performed solo, controlling the sound through her laptop, as well as singing and playing the piano and array mbira. Also that month, Heap appeared on the soundtrack for the 2005 romantic comedy film Just Like Heaven, performing a cover of the song ""Spooky"" by American band Classics IV. Heap announced, upon her return to the UK, that she had signed a deal for the album to be released internationally, as well as re-promoted in the UK, with a new imprint of Sony BMG, White Rabbit, run by former Sony BMG UK A&R vice president Nick Raphael.
In November 2005, Heap wrote and recorded the song ""Can't Take It In"" for the soundtrack of the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which was released one month later.
Speak for Yourself was re-released on the label on 24 April 2006, ahead of a full promotional push on 15 May, a week after the second single, ""Goodnight and Go"", was commercially released in the UK. Heap recorded an a cappella cover of the Leonard Cohen song ""Hallelujah"" for the season three finale of The O.C., which premiered in May 2006.
In August 2006, Heap performed a set at the V Festival, where it was announced that ""Headlock"" was to be the third single lifted from the album and released on 16 October 2006 in the UK. Heap wrote and performed the song ""Glittering Cloud"", which was based on the plague of locusts, as part of an event called the Margate Exodus sponsored by Artangel in November 2006, where ten artists each performed one song based on one of the Plagues of Egypt in Margate. The songs were compiled in the 2006 album Plague Songs.
In late September and early October, Heap embarked on a tour of the UK, holding a competition on MySpace for different support acts for each venue before touring throughout Canada and the US in November and December. This was her first tour of North America that included a band, incorporating upright bass, percussion, and support acts Kid Beyond and Levi Weaver on beatbox and guitar, respectively. In December 2006, Heap was featured on the front page of The Green Room magazine.
On 7 December 2006, Heap received two Grammy nominations for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, one for Best New Artist and the other for Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media for ""Can't Take It In"".

2008–2010: Ellipse
Throughout the creation of her album Ellipse, Heap posted vlogs or VBlogs as she called them, on YouTube.
She used these to comment on the album as well as update on its release.
The album's release was pushed back multiple times.
These included Heap being asked to perform at the annual event PopTech in October 2008. During the event, she premiered one of her album's songs, ""Wait it Out"".
In October 2008, Heap gave a musical performance in the anti-human trafficking documentary and rockumentary film Call + Response, directed by Justin Dillon. She was also featured on two songs on Jeff Beck's live album Live at Ronnie Scott's and appeared in the accompanying DVD in April 2009.
Heap announced on her Twitter page that Ellipse's first single would be ""First Train Home"".
On 17 August 2009, Heap made the entire album Ellipse available for live streaming via her webpage.
Ellipse was released in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2009 and in the United States on 25 August 2009.
Heap received two nominations for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for her engineering work on Ellipse, making her the first female artist to win the award.

2011–2014: Sparks
In March 2011, Heap began working on her then-unnamed fourth studio album and revealed that she would be writing and releasing a new single for the album once every three months, beginning with the recording and release of the album's lead single, then released under the working title ""Heapsong1"" and eventually released commercially as ""Lifeline"", via Ustream. ""Propeller Seeds"", the second single, followed in July 2011.
The third single from the album, ""Neglected Space"", was created as part of Heap's project with charity organization Clear Village to restore a walled garden in Bedfords Park in October 2011. She starred in the debut episode of the MTV India musical reality television series The Dewarists, where she recorded ""Minds Without Fear"", her fourth single from Sparks, with Indian production duo Vishal–Shekhar. Both ""Neglected Space"" and ""Minds Without Fear"" were released in October 2011.
Heap recorded her song ""Xizi She Knows"" during a trip to Hangzhou, which was partially funded by PRS for Music and the British Council. It was released as the fifth single from the album in February 2012. ""You Know Where to Find Me"" was then released as the album's sixth single. She collaborated with Canadian record producer Deadmau5 on the song ""Telemiscommunications"", which was included on his 2012 studio album, Album Title Goes Here, and released as the eighth single from the album in March 2013 alongside an animated music video. Her single ""Run-Time"" was made using a generative music app, which she designed with RjDj and Intel that created custom music for running, and was released in July 2014 with a music video.
The title of Sparks, Heap's fourth studio album, was announced in September 2013, and the album was released on 18 August 2014 through Megaphonic Records. It debuted at number 40 on the UK Albums Chart, at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and at number one on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Its deluxe boxset was nominated for the AIM Independent Music Award for Special Catalogue Release of the Year and for the Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package in 2015.

2015–present: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
In October 2015, Heap released the single ""Tiny Human"" using her blockchain-based platform Mycelia. Sales of ""Tiny Human"" via Ethereum smart contracts as of October 2017 were £30,000. After being contacted by movement director Steven Hoggett, Heap reworked and composed music from her catalogue to be used as the music in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the eighth instalment of the Harry Potter series in the form of a West End play that opened in the summer of 2016. For her work on the play, she received several award nominations, including for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Score (Broadway or Off-Broadway), and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music in a Play.
Heap co-wrote and produced the Taylor Swift song ""Clean"", which appeared as the closer to Swift's fifth studio album 1989 and led to her being part of the production team that won Album of the Year at the 58th Grammy Awards. She returned to produce the re-recording of the song for 1989 (Taylor's Version), released in 2023. Heap was one of the artists featured in an episode of the 2016 PBS docuseries Soundbreaking and she narrated and composed music for the 2016 documentary Crossing Bhutan, which premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Also in 2016, she was commissioned by French advertising agency BETC and British company Cow & Gate, in collaboration with researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London, to help write a song which would be proven to ""make babies happy"", which was eventually titled ""The Happy Song"". The track was engineered through several months of scientific testing and was released in October 2016.
Heap wrote, produced and recorded the song ""Magic Me"" as the score for the 2017 animated short film Escape, which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival in April of that year. Heap also recorded ""The Quiet"" as the end credits song for the 2017 Square Enix video game The Quiet Man. She performed ""Hide and Seek"" at the benefit concert and television special One Love Manchester in Manchester in June 2017. Her performance was praised by critics as ""powerful"" and ""melancholy"". The following month, she was featured on the song ""We Drift On"" by British singer-songwriter Dan Black from his second studio album Do Not Revenge. She announced in November 2017 that she would be reuniting Frou Frou with Guy Sigsworth and would be embarking on the Mycelia World Tour with him to promote the release of Mycelia's Creative Passport program. In March 2018, she was awarded the Inspiration Award at the 2018 Music Producers Guild Awards.

On 18 September 2018, Heap released The Music of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in Four Contemporary Suites, a condensed soundtrack album of the play. An interview with her appeared in the Alex Winter-directed documentary Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain in November 2018. The Mycelia World Tour began in Europe in 2018, while the North American leg began in April 2019, marking her first North American tour in nine years and her first tour as part of Frou Frou since 2003. That same month, she and Sigsworth released ""Guitar Song (Live)"", their first Frou Frou song in 15 years, through We Are Hear. She gave a lecture at Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2019. In June 2019, she announced that she planned to release an album consisting of collaborations in 2020, the lead single of which would be one of three versions of ""The Quiet"". She also performed on NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts series that same month.
She hosted the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony in January 2020. In April 2020, she appeared as a main artist on the commercial re-release of the 2009 song ""I'm God"" by Italian-American record producer Clams Casino, which samples Heap's song ""Just for Now"", and released the single ""Phase and Flow"" as part of a collaboration with IBM. The following month, she performed during Royal Albert Hall's Royal Albert Home virtual concert series. Heap gave a livestreamed closing performance for the Virtual Design Festival held by Dezeen in July 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she launched a self-titled app for fans to view unreleased material and demos and participate in listening parties with her through Discord for a monthly fee, and began work on a project called ""Augmented Imogen"", meant to be an AI version of herself. She released the single ""Last Night of an Empire"" in December 2020. In late March 2022, Imogen Heap partnered with Symphonic Distribution to re-release previous material, including a handful of Frou Frou demos, which will compile into the Off Cuts release. The first single ""A New Kind of Love (Demo)"" is slated to release 8 April.

Film
After touring for nearly two years straight for her album Speak for Yourself, Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on hand as she began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning Ellipse and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in Essex, Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap's childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse was released in November 2010.
On 5 November 2010 at the Royal Albert Hall, Heap conducted an orchestra including her friends and family as they performed an original piece composed by Heap and orchestrated by Andrew Skeet. Heap also worked with London Contemporary Voices at this time, a scratch choir formed for this concert, which continues as a new choir in its own right. It was the score to the concept film Love The Earth, for which fans were invited to submit video footage highlighting all the qualities of nature to be selected and edited into a film. This performance was broadcast live worldwide.
In March, for the Birds Eye View Film Festival at the Southbank Centre, Heap, in collaboration with Andrew Skeet, composed an a cappella choral score for the first-ever surrealist film The Seashell and the Clergyman (Germaine Dulac, 1927), with the Holst Singers, a programme repeated at the Reverb Festival at the Roundhouse in February 2012 and in the Sage, Gateshead.
Heap performed in the Film and Music Arena at Latitude Festival in 2011.
In 2014, filmmaker Christopher Ian Smith made Cumulus, an experimental documentary exploring key elements of Heap's background, personality and music practice. Crafted entirely out of social media content and data created by Heap and her fans, Cumulus explores Imogen's digital footprint and identity as well as her relationship with fans. The film is available to view online.

Other endeavors
Mi.Mu
In July 2011, Heap unveiled a pair of in-development, wired musical gloves at the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. They were originally developed by Heap with Tom Mitchell, a University of the West of England, Bristol lecturer in music systems, and designed and sewn by Rachel Freire, a costume designer, over the course of the prior two and a half years. They were inspired by another pair of musical gloves developed by engineer Elly Jessop at MIT which Heap had witnessed during a visit to the university's Media Lab. Early versions of Heap's gloves had issues with latency and accuracy. In an interview, Heap stated, ""The gloves help me embody those sounds which are hidden inside the computer, for me to physicalize them and bring them out so that I can play them and the audience members will understand what I am doing—rather than fiddling around on a keyboard and mouse which is not very clear—I could just be doing my emails.""
The gloves, which eventually came to be known as the Mi.Mu gloves (a name derived from an abbreviation of ""me"" and ""music""), are made from the material Yulex and consist of a hardware board at the wrist developed by Seb Madgwick with an inertial measurement unit used to determine the speed and orientation of the hands, flex sensors over the knuckles, a haptic motor, a removable battery, open palms and LED lights in between the thumb and forefinger which indicate whether or not the user is recording. Open Sound Control data is sent to a computer, which can perform a number of different actions, including adjusting volume, recording loops and filtering sound. The gloves also come with a custom software called Glover that can be integrated with music production apps such as Ableton Live and Pro Tools, and use 802.11 Wi-Fi.
Heap recorded her song ""Me the Machine"" using an early version of the gloves, debuting the single during a livestream on Earth Day in 2012. Also in 2012, she showcased the Mi.Mu gloves on an episode of the BBC television series Dara Ó Briain's Science Club. Heap began crowdfunding to produce more pairs of the gloves in April 2014 on Kickstarter, with a goal of £200,000, but the campaign failed to meet its target. However, the Mi.Mu project found investors who collaborated with Heap's team to continue to develop the gloves. An early investor and user of the gloves was American singer Ariana Grande, who used the gloves during her second concert tour, The Honeymoon Tour, in 2015. In April 2019, the Mi.Mu gloves became publicly available for pre-order. Popular Science included the Mi.Mu gloves on their list of the 100 greatest innovations of 2019.

Mycelia
In October 2015, Heap released the single ""Tiny Human"" using the blockchain-based platform Mycelia, which she created as a decentralized musical database for artists to share their music on and enforce smart contracts using Ethereum. Mycelia's Creative Passport program is a personalized profile for artists not signed to a major label. As of August 2016, gross sales of ""Tiny Human"" through Mycelia amounted to $133.20.

Artistry
In the late 1990s, Heap's music was largely alternative rock. Her earlier songs, specifically those from her debut album I Megaphone, were frequently compared in the media to those of fellow singer-songwriters Tori Amos, Kate Bush and Alanis Morissette. However, after forming and subsequently disbanding the electronic duo Frou Frou, whose work on their sole album to date, Details, was mainly alternative pop and electropop, her music became primarily based in pop, specifically electropop, art pop and synth-pop. She has written, produced and engineered most of her music on her own. She has also stated that she rarely listens to music, but draws inspiration from TED conferences.
Heap plays a number of instruments, including piano, clarinet, cello, guitar, drums and the array mbira. She extensively uses manipulated electronic sounds as an integral part of her music. She also mixes ambient sound into her music and has commented that ""certain sounds give the music a width and a space, and that's important."" CNN stated that Heap is known for ""her distinctive fusion of soft acoustic sounds, electronica and tech"".
Heap states that her song lyrics come from personal experience, but are not straightforwardly confessional. She has stated, ""Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened.""
Heap's frog-themed outfit at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards has been included in several lists of the most ""outrageous"" Grammys outfits of all time.

Legacy
Heap has been regarded as influential in pop music, specifically in electropop and for using technology in her music. NPR's Lindsay Kimbell also referred to Heap as a ""pioneer of electronic pop"" in 2018. Billboard called Heap an ""electro-pop innovator"". In 2018, Stereogum's Margaret Farrell referred to Heap as ""pop's unsung pioneer"" and ""an electronic pop mastermind"", going on to describe her as ""a mystical force that has loomed over pop music for nearly two decades"". In 2019, The New York Times similarly called Heap a ""pop pioneer"" whose work ""has established her as an innovator in musical technology"". For Paper, Matt Moen called Heap ""the Nikola Tesla of pop music"" in that ""[her] influence in the field of pop has largely gone unappreciated in her own time"". Various outlets, including NPR and New Statesman, have called Heap a ""tech pioneer"". Patrick Ryan of USA Today wrote that Heap ""pioneered"" the subgenre of folktronica, which combines elements of folk music and electronica.
Heap has been cited as a musical inspiration by a number of artists and groups, including Ariana Grande, Bebe Rexha, Ellie Goulding, Kacey Musgraves, Pentatonix, Chloe Bailey, Empress Of, Dawn Richard, Jamila Woods, Muna, Mree, Woodes, Ben Hopkins, Matthew Parker, Red Moon, Michelle Chamuel, Chaz Cardigan, Laura Doggett, GoodLuck, Kool Kojak, and Stars and Rabbit. Heap's songs have also been covered by artists including Pentatonix and Kelly Clarkson, and have been sampled by artists including Grande, Jason Derulo, Wiz Khalifa, Mac Miller, Clams Casino, Lil B, Ryan Hemsworth, Deniro Farrar, Suicideboys, ASAP Rocky, MellowHype, Trinidad James and Kendrick Lamar. The sampling of her songs has been considered influential in the subgenre of cloud rap.

Charity
In 2008, Heap participated in an album called Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace, which is an initiative to support Tibet, Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and to underline the human rights situation in Tibet. The album was released on 5 August via iTunes and on 19 August in music stores around the world. On 12 October 2008, Heap participated in ""Run 10k: Cancer Research UK"", placing fifth of the women in the actual run and raising over £1000 for the cause with the help of her fans.
In 2010 Heap began performing improvised pieces at shows, asking for donations for charity after the show to download the song.
In 2011, Heap played a benefit concert in Christchurch, New Zealand, to help rebuild the Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti High School following a severe earthquake which destroyed a large portion of the city earlier in the year. The concert was held at the Burnside High Aurora Centre, also featuring performances from Roseanna Gamlen-Greene, and The Harbour Union including The Eastern, Lindon Puffin, Delaney Davidson and The Unfaithful Ways. It was her only New Zealand show for the year.
On 4 June 2017, Heap performed at One Love Manchester, a benefit concert organised by Ariana Grande in response to the bombing after her concert at Manchester Arena two weeks earlier. She performed ""Hide and Seek"". Other celebrity participants included Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Niall Horan, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus and Pharrell Williams.

Live 4 X
In 2010, Imogen Heap partnered with Thomas Ermacora of Bubbletank to organise a series of online charitable events called Live 4 X.
The initial event was inspired by the 2010 Pakistan floods. Triggered by monsoon rains, the floods left approximately one-fifth of the country of Pakistan under water, affecting over 14 million people and damaging or destroying over 900,000 homes. Teaming up with Richard Branson's Virgin Unite and Vokle.com, Heap and Ermacora created a webcast/online fundraiser to raise awareness and money for those affected by the floods. Hosted by comedian, creative and Internet personality Ze Frank, the webcast included a series of conversations with Cameron Sinclair of Architecture for Humanity, Gary Slutkin and Anders Wilhelmson (and later Richard Branson and Mary Robinson), with live performances by musicians Ben Folds, Amanda Palmer, Kate Havnevik, KT Tunstall, Josh Groban, Kaki King, Zoe Keating and Mark Isham.
The premise of Live 4 X thus established, Heap has since continued to refine the model, organize, host and perform a number of charitable, live-streaming concert events. By integrating live entertainment with educated discussion and technology, Live 4 X became an effective charitable outreach tool.
Following the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011, Heap told Washington Times Communities journalist and recording artist Jennifer Grassman that she intended to continue organising Live 4 X events to benefit various charitable causes.
Catalogue of Live 4 X events to date:

31 August 2010 – Live 4 Pakistan raised funds for flood relief and recovery in that region. Musicians included Ben Folds, Amanda Palmer, Kate Havnevik, KT Tunstall, Josh Groban and Zoe Keating. In an ironic turn of events, Heap was kept from appearing on Live 4 Pakistan due to Hurricane Earl which at the time was progressing along the US eastern seaboard. Heap, stranded and unable to get an internet connection, later posted a video message as well as a performance of her song ""Wait It Out"" from Ellipse.
3 February 2011 – Live 4 Cape Town
11 April 2011 – Live 4 Sendai raised funds for Japanese tsunami recovery following the disastrous Great East Japan earthquake of 2011. The event was also used to solicit rebuilding design ideas on behalf of Architecture for Humanity. Performers included Amanda Palmer, Ben Folds, KT Tunstall and Jamie Cullum and hosted by Ze Frank.

Personal life
Heap began dating film director Michael Lebor in 2012. In June 2014, Heap announced in her video blog that she was pregnant with her first child with Lebor. She gave birth to their daughter later that year.
Heap's sister, Juliet, died while abroad in November 2019.

Maarten van der Vleuten,"Maarten van der Vleuten (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmaːrtə(ɱ) vɑn dər ˈvløːtə(n)]) is a Dutch producer, composer and recording artist born in Vught, The Netherlands in 1967. Between 1987 and 2007 he used over two dozens of aliases, producing Detroit techno, electro, house, experimental and ambient music.
In early 2008 he announced that he would only use his real name for future releases. He recorded for R&S Records, Outrage Recordings, Apollo Records (Belgium), Djax-Up-Beats, See Saw, ESP and Klang Elektronik to name just a few.
Since 1996 he is also releasing music on his own label Signum Recordings (and its two sublabels Passiflora and Glam). Maarten's musical vision knows no limits: working in his own studio, he's constantly experimenting and exploring all aspects of (danceable) music, looking for innovation and bringing new angles to it. Due to his experimental vision towards his music, Van Der Vleuten's productions are not mainstream material. As a result of that he has gained more credits from within the ""underground"" scene. Or as the database of the Dutch Rock & Pop Institute writes; ""one of the pioneers of the dutch dance scene"".

Aliases
All known aliases in alphabetical order:
48V Phantom Power, Cliche, Cryptic, DJ Dusk, DJ G-Spot, Dutch Department Of Techno, E144, E414, Error 144, Error 441, Flash Back, Flux, Frantic, G.S.G, Gangrene, In-Existence, Integrity, Major Malfunction, N.Cantado, The Noise Architect, Orpheus, Party Marty, Pultec, V48, Vandervleuten, Zimt.

In-Existence
""In-Existence"" is the alias van der Vleuten uses for his ambient-related musical projects. In 1993 the debut album Moonwater by In-Existence was released on the ambient label Apollo Records (Belgium), a subsidiary of R&S Records. (Musically a mix between Detroit techno and ambient)
On Van Der Vleuten's own label Signum Recordings the follow-up was released 1998; Private Rituals. A mix of ambient, worldmusic and classical. Guest musicians that appear on the album are; Edwin Paanakker, Eddie Persijn, Frans Friedrich and Choir Jeroen Bosch. The album Vow of Silence, on Tonefloat, musically referred to the debut with ambient-techno influences.
The fourth album ...Of Truth, Eternal Beauty And Nought... again sounded familiar with the ambient-techno influences. The opening track Capezzoli Di Venere is a 45-minute, almost neo-romantic sounding piece of spacious sounds and rhythmic sequences which is quite a contradiction to the extremely dark final title I Have This Pain.
The tone has been set and the last In-Existence album De Verkenningen continues with dark, droned sounds. The last track on the album, Vierde Verkenning is used by Dutch contemporary artist Frank Havermans and can be heard inside the art-installation KAPKAR / TT-C2P. The installation is part of the exhibition Tangible Traces- Dutch Architecture and Design by Netherlands Architecture Instituut and will travel around the world for two years, opening at November 10, 2007, during the Seventh São Paulo Biennale of Architecture in Brazil. Up to now the exhibition travelled to Vienna (Austria) and Hong Kong.

Video interview (in Dutch) with Van Der Vleuten during November Music Festival 2012 by VPRO Eigentijds"
Inon Zur,"Inon Zur (Hebrew: ינון צור, [jiˈnon ˈt͡sur]) is an Israeli-American composer of soundtracks for film, television, and video games. He has composed soundtracks for over 80 video games, which include Dragon Age, EverQuest, Fallout, Prince of Persia, Star Trek, the Syberia series, and Starfield. He's received numerous nominations—including three BAFTAs—and has won a number of awards, which include: an Emmy Award and two Game Audio Network Guild Awards, the first in 2004 for Best Original Instrumental Track for Men of Valor and another in 2009 for Best Interactive Score for Crysis. Received two Hollywood Music in Media Awards in 2009 for Best Original Song for Dragon Age: Origins and in 2019 for Best Original Score/Song for The Elder Scrolls: Blades.

Early life
Inon Zur was born in Israel. At the age of five, he was trying to compose harmonies with his mother's singing, and became inspired by classical music. He learned to play the French horn as a child, studied piano by the age of eight, and was studying composition by the age of ten. He graduated from the Music Academy of Tel Aviv, and spent four years in the Israeli Army in an elite Armored unit. He emigrated to the United States in 1990 to study at the Dick Grove School of Music for a year, and then under private tutor Jack Smalley, a television music composer, and others for two years at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Career
Zur began his career in 1994 by working on soundtracks for movies, such as Yellow Lotus, featured at the Sundance Film Festival. He signed on to compose for Fox Family for six years, and made soundtracks for various children's television shows produced by Saban Entertainment, including Big Bad Beetleborgs, Digimon and Power Rangers. By 2002, he estimated that he had composed the soundtrack to over 360 Power Rangers episodes. His compositions for these programs were credited to Shuki Levy and Kussa Mahchi (an allias for Haim Saban), with Zur usually only being credited as a music producer. This was allegedly so the duo could collect the music royalties. Zur and all other composers working at this company agreed to give up the rights to their compositions prior to joining.  He won his first award during this period in his career, a Telly Award for his work on Power Rangers: Turbo. While he enjoyed the work, he began to want to go work somewhere ""more intriguing, more advanced, and basically a place that people really appreciate music more""; his agent overcame his initial reluctance and convinced him to work in the video games industry. His first video game soundtrack was 2000's Star Trek: Klingon Academy, which he started composing for the game in 1997. Zur moved on to prestigious titles, composing for the award-winning and critically acclaimed Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal in 2001 and Icewind Dale II in 2002, among many others. Icewind Dale II earned him the first of many nominations for video game music awards, that of the Game Audio Network Guild's Music of the Year award. He continued to work on movies and television programs during these years.
Zur has made dozens of cinematic scores for trailers. His last full movie soundtrack to date was that of 2014's Reclaim. He has worked on a few television series since then; his last traditional television soundtrack was for Ghost Whisperer in 2007, though he has composed music for webisode and Animated series since then. He continued to work on numerous video games, including Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones in 2005 and Crysis in 2007. He has garnered several nominations for video game music awards, including his first win, for Men of Valor in the Best Original Instrumental track category of the 2004 Game Audio Network Guild awards. 
Zur penned the original musical score for  Crysis, Dragon Age, Fallout, Syberia, and Starfield franchises.
The most notable titles Zur has composed for have been Icewind Dale II (2002), EverQuest Online Adventures (2003), Men of Valor (2004), Crysis (2007), Fallout 3 (2008), Prince of Persia (2008), Dragon Age: Origins (2009), Fallout: New Vegas (2010), World of Tanks (2010), Dragon Age II (2011), Fallout 4 (2015), Fallout 76 (2018), The Elder Scrolls: Blades (2019) and, most recently, Starfield (2023).

Performances
Zur's compositions have been played several times in live concerts. The first of these was a concert held in Seoul, South Korea, on May 30, 2006, dedicated to his music for Lineage II: Chronicle V: Oath of Blood. On August 20, 2008, music from his soundtrack to Crysis was played in Leipzig, Germany, at a Video Games Live concert. His music from Dragon Age: Origins and Prince of Persia was performed at the September 26, 2009 ""A Night in Fantasia 2009"" concert in Sydney, Australia, by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra. Zur was a special guest at the concert.
In an industry first, a dedicated concert of his music from Lord of the Rings: War in the North was performed each evening at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles. The one-hour concert series was conducted by Zur and performed by The Hollywood Orchestra and Choir with the participation of The Lyris Quartet and solos from celebrated vocalist Aubrey Ashburn. He originally conducted and recorded the game with the London Philharmonia Orchestra and the Pinewood Singers Choir at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London.
In 2018, at the London venue the Eventim Apollo, Zur composed his different pieces from the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls series during a live concert that Bethesda Game Studios co-hosted with the War Child (charity). The London Symphony Orchestra performed Zur's Starfield score at Bethesda's 10th Anniversary The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim concert in 2021. The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra gave a 10-year concert on June 25, 2023, at The Game Awards, which featured well-known video game soundtracks. The concert included a rendition of Zur's Starfield theme.

Legacy
Zur's music has been featured in numerous top-selling game franchises. He has been described as being ""internationally recognized as one of the A-list orchestral composers in the video games industry"".Variety named him on a short list of top video game composers.
In the film industry Zur specializes on cinematic scoring for film trailers. He's worked with the likes of BMG Production Music on films such as the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Hobbit, and 
Avengers: Age of Ultron. Including dozens of other film trailer music.
His songs have often been covered by numerous artists. Raney Shockne and Elizaveta did a cover of Zur's Dragon Age: Origins ""I am the One"" song for Dragon Age: Inquisitions. Zur was inducted into The Recording Academy as a new member in 2023.

Musical style and influences
Zur's compositions frequently are focused on full orchestras, choir and, in some games like Prince of Persia, ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind duduk. He has often collaborated with the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though he has on occasion used other orchestras. Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself. He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as Sergey Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Beethoven, movie composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, and jazz artists like George Gershwin and Henry McFeeny. While he would one day like to compose music not intended to be part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process. He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it ""from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own"". Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks; for example, he worked with Florence and the Machine to create a unique rendition of ""I'm Not Calling You A Liar"" for the Dragon Age II soundtrack.

Zur typically is brought in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more ""flexible"" process. He finds that it is ""crucial"" for him to play a game before he can compose music for it, even if it's only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music ""intuitively"", rather than spending a lot of time planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects that he would like to work on in the future that he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.

Irv Teibel,"Irving Solomon ""Irv"" Teibel (October 9, 1938 – October 28, 2010) was an American field recordist, graphic designer, and photographer. His company, Syntonic Research, Inc., is best known for its influential environments psychoacoustic recording series (1969–1979) and The Altered Nixon Speech (1973). Teibel was also an accomplished photographer who worked as an editor for Ziff Davis and photographed for Popular Photography and Car and Driver.

Biography and Work
Teibel was born in Buffalo, New York in 1938. He attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California before serving in the army as a public information specialist in Stuttgart, Germany. During this time he became interested in electronic music and musique concrète and began experimenting with tape at a local radio station. While in Germany he also claimed to have studied briefly with Karlheinz Stockhausen.
Teibel returned from Europe in 1966 and settled in New York City where he worked a number of jobs including associate editor at Ziff Davis. He also took night classes in electronic music at The New School during this time and was a founding resident of the famous Westbeth Artists Community. In 1969, he worked with Tony Conrad on Conrad's film Coming Attractions which involved recording the ocean at Coney Island. After this experience, Teibel became interested in using natural white noise for psychological purposes. Working with neuropsychologist Lou Gerstman at Bell Labs, he processed a short ocean loop recorded at Brighton Beach through an IBM 360 computer to create one continuous thirty-minute soundscape. This became the first environments recording, ""The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore."" The record was unique for its extremely long playback times—30 minutes per side at 331⁄3 rpm—and could be played at any speed from 162⁄3 up to 45 rpm. ""The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore"" was one of the first commercially available releases edited with a mainframe computer and one of the earlier examples of commercial quadraphonic sound.
In 1970, Teibel created an environmental sound installation for the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and in 1971, he began teaching a class in experimental recording techniques at The New School.
In 1973, to demonstrate how magnetic tape could be manipulated, Teibel edited Richard Nixon’s August 15th speech to reveal that the president, in fact, had “prior knowledge” of the Watergate break-in. In the subsequent years, Teibel performed as an expert witness for magnetic tape technology.
In 1981, Teibel moved to Austin, Texas with his then-wife Rosanne. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Dara. In Austin, Teibel was involved in the local Jewish community. He lived there for 29 years until his death on October 28, 2010 at age 72.
His brother Phil was a violinist with the Buffalo Philharmonic.

Influence
Over the years, Teibel's recordings attracted significant national and international attention from publications like The New York Times. Teibel claimed environments 6 was excerpted in the “Sounds of Earth” audio collage aboard the Voyager Spacecraft’s Golden Record (this is still unverified). His work also appears in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven, credited as ""special environmental sound recording,"" and Errol Morris' Gates of Heaven as ""environmental sound."" In 2013, his work appeared in Lise Raven's film Kinderwald.
Music critic Robert Christgau described Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music as ""Lou's answer to Environments"" and Lester Bangs included environments 2 on his list of the ""Ten Most Ridiculous Records of the Seventies."" Musicians Dominick Fernow and Mica Levi have also listed environments LPs as among their favorite recordings. Outside magazine included environments 1 on their list of ""The Top 10 Field Recordings."" The album cover for the drone metal group Earth's album Earth 2 is an homage to the environments 2 CD with its ""special low frequency version"" message.
Atlas Obscura has described Teibel as ""a forgotten 1970s-era hippie polymath."" They go on to explain his lasting influence: ""If you flip on a waterfall to fall asleep, if you keep rainymood.com in your bookmarks, if you associate well-being with the sound of streams and crickets or wonder why the beach never quite sounds as tranquil as you imagine, it's because of Teibel.""
Pitchfork elaborates on the novelty of Teibel's work: ""Now, Teibel’s concept—the soothing sounds of nature, or at least a synthesized facsimile of it—is quaint, the wallpaper of therapy waiting rooms and spa foyers. At the time, it was entirely new."" They go on to explain the complicated place Teibel's work inhabits in the history of field recording and music: ""Here was nature not as it is, but as we hope it’ll be, the lullaby of waves without the sand in our trunks.""
In February 2018, the Chicago reissue label Numero Group re-released Teibel's original recordings as an ambient sound app for iOS devices.

Jah Wobble,"John Joseph Wardle (born 11 August 1958), known by the stage name Jah Wobble, is an English bass guitarist and singer. He became known to a wider audience as the original bass player in Public Image Ltd (PiL) in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he left the band after two albums.
Following his departure from PiL, he developed a solo career. In 2012, he reunited with fellow PiL guitarist Keith Levene for Metal Box in Dub and the album Yin & Yang. Since 2013, he has been one of the featured pundits on Sunday morning's The Virtual Jukebox segment of BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night with Dotun Adebayo. His autobiography, Memoirs of a Geezer, was published in 2009.

Early life
Wardle was born in Stepney, East London, his father, Harry Eugene Wardle, worked as a postman, while his mother, Kathleen Bridget (née Fitzgibbon), was a school and County Hall secretary. Wobble grew up with his family in Whitechapel's Clichy Estate in London's East End. He is a long-time friend of John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), whom he had met in the 1970s at London's Kingsway College. The two formed half of the group of friends known as ""The Four Johns"", along with John Grey and John Simon Ritchie (later known as Sid Vicious). Jah Wobble acquired his stage name through the drunken, mumbled version of Wardle's name by Sid Vicious, which Wobble kept because ""people would never forget it"".

Musical career
In his early life and career, by his own admission, Wardle was given to occasional bouts of aggression, exacerbated by heavy drinking and drug use. As a result, he ended up living in a squat with John Gray in West London, while Lydon formed The Sex Pistols. With admittedly large ""builders hands"", he had experimented with the guitar, but found playing bass a more connected and whole body experience, influenced in part by admiring Bob Marley's and The Wailers bassist Aston ""Family Man"" Barrett on stage in 1975. Wardle was as critical of his friend Vicious's bass playing as John Lydon, and had hence played in experimentation sessions with Lydon. After he burned the furniture of his squat-mates in order to stay warm, they left him alone there with a mattress, a headboard and his Music Man-copy bass.

Public Image Ltd (PiL)
Following the Sex Pistols' break-up, Lydon approached Wobble about forming a band. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. The band began rehearsing together in May 1978, although remained unnamed until July 1978, when Lydon officially named the band Public Image (PiL) (the ""Ltd"" was not added until several months later), after the Muriel Spark novel The Public Image. Wobble's bass playing drew heavily on dub, which has remained an important feature of his music. Having experimented with Lydon pre-Sex Pistols break-up, he had written a simple repetitive bassline on which Lydon wrote ""Public Image"". PiL debuted in October 1978 with ""Public Image"", which reached number 9 on the UK charts, and also performed well on import in the US. Wobble has stated that the first PiL album was recorded so quickly due in part to the bassist's altercations with a sound engineer and men at a nearby pub. He has, however, dismissed claims accusing him of extreme malice, such as setting fire to the former drummer for The Fall, Karl Burns, while Burns was session drumming for PiL.
Wobble co-wrote and contributed bass and drums to PiL's second album Metal Box, which was released in 1979. However, he grew increasingly frustrated by the lacklustre creative atmosphere in the band, which he felt stifled his artistic ambitions and PiL's creative potential. Besides differences in artistic vision, further conflicts were brought on in part by heavy drug and alcohol abuse in the band. Wobble then recorded his debut album The Legend Lives On... Jah Wobble in ""Betrayal"", making unauthorised use of material from Metal Box for which he was summarily fired from PiL in late 1980.
Wobble also released at least one single during his period as a member of PiL: His 1978 single ""Dreadlock Don't Deal in Wedlock"" in which he recites Edward Lear's ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" and finishes with the line, 'love and marriage is like ice cream and cabbage ... dreadlock don't deal in wedlock.""

Early post-PiL years
Soon after leaving PiL, Wobble formed The Human Condition with guitarist Dave ""Animal"" Maltby and PiL's original drummer, Jim Walker. The Human Condition toured the UK, Europe, and US in 1981, and made two cassette-only releases of their live shows (Live at the Collegiate Theatre and Live in Europe). The post-PiL years saw Wobble also collaborating with Can members Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit on Czukay's solo projects (notably On the Way to the Peak of Normal and Rome Remains Rome) and Full Circle (released in 1984).
In 1983, Wardle appeared on the LP Snake Charmer billed as a co-leader alongside guitarist The Edge of U2, Czukay, Liebezeit, and producer François Kevorkian.
Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart was formed in 1982. The original line-up was Ollie Marland on keys (who went on to become Tina Turner's musical director), Annie Whitehead on trombone, Neville Murray on percussion and a musician named only as Cliff, on drums. By 1983 Lee Partis was the drummer. Trumpeter Harry Beckett and pedal steel player B. J. Cole regularly performed with the group.
By 1985 Jah Wobble's heavy drinking and drunken brawls were having an effect on his life. Halfway through the recording of the album Psalms (October 1986), Wobble stopped drinking. From then through to the present day he has remained 'clean and sober'.
He then did a variety of day jobs, whilst continuing to perform and record his music in what spare time he had. These jobs included a long stretch with the London Underground. In an oft-quoted tale, it is related that he once, at Tower Hill Underground Station via the public address system, regaled commuters with the deadpan announcement, ""I used to be somebody. I repeat, I used to be somebody.""
By 1987, due to the repeated prompting of his friend and former bandmate, percussionist Neville Murray, Wobble reformed The Invaders of the Heart. Armed with a live recording of a concert he had made with a new line-up of musicians during a European tour in 1988, Wobble travelled to New York City's New Music Seminar in 1989 to get back into the music industry. Wobble was able to secure an eleventh-hour record deal with a small European record label. The live album, Without Judgement, was recorded in the Netherlands and was released in November 1989. 
Following the relative success of Without Judgement, Wobble has collaborated with many musicians - Brian Eno among them - & his explorations into world music predated much of the genre's popularity. Wobble hit his commercial peak with 1991's Rising Above Bedlam. While the album did not chart, it spawned four singles including his first top-40 hit, Visions of You, featuring Sinéad O'Connor. Jah Wobble's 1994 album Take Me To God was influenced by world music genres and contributions from a variety of artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, including Baaba Maal, Dolores O'Riordan, and Chaka Demus, and was also a critical and commercial success.

Mid 1990s to present
Although he has released recordings since the late seventies, Wobble has been particularly prolific from the mid-1990s to the present. He now runs his own label, 30 Hertz Records, and tours regularly throughout the UK and Europe with his current band, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart.
His music has spanned a number of genres, including ambient music and dance music, and in 2003, reworkings of traditional English folk songs. 
Wobble was part of the industrial music supergroup The Damage Manual, which formed in 2000 and consisted of Wobble on bass alongside former PiL and Killing Joke drummer Martin Atkins, Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker, and vocalist Chris Connelly (who had previously worked with Atkins as part of two other industrial music supergroups, Pigface and Murder Inc., the latter of which also featured Walker). He appeared on the group's self-titled debut album as well as the EP One, both of which were released on Atkins' Invisible Records label, but subsequently left the group after declining to participate in their tour of the U.S.
A collaboration with his wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player Zi Lan Liao, was entitled Chinese Dub. He also performed at the 2008 Rhythm Festival.
Jah Wobble and the Chinese Dub Orchestra won the Cross-Cultural Collaboration category, for their album Chinese Dub, in the inaugural Songlines Music Awards, announced on 1 May 2009, which were the new world music awards organised by the UK based magazine, Songlines.
In September 2009, John Lydon reformed PiL for a series of concerts in late 2009. Despite Lydon's invitation to join, Jah Wobble did not feature in the line-up, since he considered the wages offered insufficient and disagreed with the choice of venues.
At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Johnny Rotter of the Sex Pistols Experience, Wobble renewed his association with former PiL guitarist Keith Levene.
In 2011, Wobble collaborated with Julie Campbell, alias Warp Records artist LoneLady in a project called Psychic Life. The debut album, Psychic Life, was inspired by disco, post-punk and psychogeography, and released by Cherry Red Records on 14 November 2011. Keith Levene contributed to three tracks on the album. A digital-only EP, Psychic Life, fronted by the song ""Tightrope"", was released in October 2011.
In early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Wobble and Levene played various UK clubs as Metal Box in Dub.  The visa issues were resolved and they played Fuji Rock festival in July 2012. This was followed by the release of a four-song, eponymous EP. An album entitled Yin & Yang was released in November 2012.
Wobble has also collaborated with the British ambient group Marconi Union, the results of which were released as an album called Anomic on 30 Hertz records in June 2013. In October 2013, 30 Hertz Records released Odds & Sods & Epilogues, an illustrated book/CD of Jah Wobble's poetry.
In 2015, Cherry Red Records released Redux, a six-CD box set that spans nearly four decades of Wobble's music. It includes new tracks Merry Go Round and Let's Go Psycho.

Jean-Michel Jarre,"Jean-Michel André Jarre (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl ɑ̃dʁe ʒaʁ]; born 24 August 1948) is a French composer, performer and record producer. He is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres, and is known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music, accompanied by vast laser displays, large projections and fireworks.
Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages; but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.
His first mainstream success was the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 18 million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events.
As of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80 million albums and singles. He was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in the People's Republic of China and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event for his Moscow concert on 6 September 1997, which was attended by 3.5 million people.

Biography
Early life, influences, and education
Jean-Michel Jarre was born in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to Francette Pejot, a French Resistance member and concentration camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. His grandmother was Jewish. When Jarre was five, his parents separated and his father moved to the United States, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first tape recorder. From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young Jarre was able to observe street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.
Jarre struggled with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers and worked on his scales. A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the Saint-Ouen flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a Boris Vian trumpet violin. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui Pêche (The Fishing Cat), a Paris jazz club run by one of her friends from her resistance years, where saxophonists Archie Shepp and John Coltrane, and trumpet players Don Cherry and Chet Baker were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be ""descriptive, without lyrics"". He was also influenced by the work of French artist Pierre Soulages, whose exhibition at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris he attended. Soulages' paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that ""for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds."" He was also influenced by classical, modernist music; in a 2004 interview for The Guardian, he spoke of the effect that a performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring had upon him:

This is where Stravinsky created it in 1913, and it was a huge shock. I also saw the last concert by the great Arabic singer Om Khalsoum. She is the goddess, the Maria Callas of the Orient. Then I heard ""Georgia on My Mind"" by Ray Charles, and I realised that music can talk to your tummy. I was so impressed by the organic sensuality coming from Ray Charles's music – there was no intellectual process and it was great.
As a young man Jarre earned money by selling his paintings, exhibiting some of his works at the Lyon Gallery – L'Œil écoute, and by playing in a band called Mystère IV. While he studied at the Lycée Michelet, his mother arranged for him to take lessons in harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Jeannine Rueff of the Conservatoire de Paris. In 1967 he played guitar in a band called The Dustbins, who appear in the film Des garçons et des filles. He mixed instruments including the electric guitar and the flute with tape effects and other sounds. More experimentation was followed in 1968, when he began to use tape loops, radios and other electronic devices, in 1969 he joined the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM), founded and led by Pierre Schaeffer, inventor of musique concrete. Jarre was introduced to the Moog modular synthesizer and spent time working at the studio of influential German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne.

In the kitchen of his apartment in Rue de la Trémoille, Jarre set up a small makeshift recording studio. It included his first synthesiser, an EMS VCS 3, and an EMS Synthi AKS, each linked to Revox tape machines. For a 1969 exposition at the Maison de la Culture (Cultural House) in Reims, Jarre wrote the five-minute song ""Happiness Is a Sad Song"". That same year he composed and recorded ""La Cage/Erosmachine"", a mixture of harmony, tape effects and synthesisers, which was released in 1971.

1970s
In 1971 Jarre was commissioned by choreographer Norbert Schmucki to perform a ballet called AOR (in Hebrew, ""the light""), at the Palais Garnier. He also composed background music for ballet, theatre, television programs, department stores, and advertising jingles for Pepsi-Cola, Nestlé and RTL. The music for airports, and North America libraries was composed with the VCS 3 and an Farfisa professional organ. From 1972 to 1975, Jean-Michel wrote music and lyrics for artists like Françoise Hardy, Gérard Lenorman, Christophe and Patrick Juvet. In 1972 collaborated in Olympia show, and wrote music for the International Festival of Magic. That year he also released his first solo album, Deserted Palace, and composed the soundtrack for Les Granges Brûlées (English: The Burned Barns).

Jarre's 1976 low-budget solo album Oxygène, recorded at his home studio, made him famous internationally. The music was made with analog synthesizers like the EMS VCS 3 and the EMS Synthi AKS, and recorded with a Scully 8-track recorder. Jarre initially was turned down by several record companies, until Jean-Michel decided to meet with Francis Dreyfus, the head of the Disques Motors label, to see if he could release the album, to which he accepted. The first pressing of 50,000 copies was promoted through hi-fi shops, clubs and discos, and by April 1977 had sold 70,000 copies in France. When interviewed in Billboard magazine, Motors's director Stanislas Witold said, ""In a sense we're putting most of our bets on Jean-Michel Jarre. He is quite exceptional and we're sure that by 1980 he will be recognised worldwide.""
Jarre's follow-up album, Équinoxe, was released in 1978, though its sales were still healthy, it had less of an impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a world record for the largest number of spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1 million spectators. Although it was not the first time he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40 minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and the Frenchman Francis Rimbert featured at the event.

1980s
By the time Les Chants Magnétiques was released on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6 million units. In its first two months the then new album sold a reported 200,000 units in France alone. The album uses sounds from the Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was a pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.
In that same year, the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène, Équinoxe, and Les Chants Magnétiques, which became the first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese national radio in decades. The Republic invited Jarre to become the first western musician to play in post-Mao Zedong China. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. However, only 5 concerts were given in total, two in Beijing and three in Shanghai. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts.
The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.

Between February and May 1983, Jarre recorded a single LP copy of an album entitled Musique pour Supermarché (English: Music for Supermarkets) whose objective was to be the soundtrack of a show called Orrimbe, to later be auctioned with the master tapes and plates destroyed. The album was later broadcast exclusively on Radio Luxembourg with Jarre encouraging listeners to record the broadcast.
In 1984, he  released seventh studio album Zoolook, in this album was expanded the sample-based approach which had been initiated on Les Chants Magnétiques and continued on Music for Supermarkets, the album was based around multiple fragments of human voices pronouncing words and speeches in different languages from all over the world, recorded digitally by Jarre and then played back and edited on the Fairlight CMI.

In 1985, Jarre was invited by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual grandeur of the city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.

Jarre worked with several Houston-based astronauts, including Bruce McCandless II and Ronald McNair, an accomplished musician who was to have played the saxophone on ""Rendez-Vous VI"", recorded in the weightless environment of space. The live performance was curtailed by McNair's death in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986. Consideration was given to the cancellation of the concert; but McCandless contacted Jarre and urged him to proceed, in memory of the shuttle's crew. McNair's saxophone piece was recorded by French saxophonist Pierre Gossez and retitled ""Ron's Piece"". At Jarre's giant concerts in Houston and Lyon, the part was performed by McNair's friend, American saxophonist Kirk Whalum:

I remember just before take-off, Ron calling me in Paris saying ""Everything's ready, see you in a week's time, watch me on television for the take-off"" ... I will really, keep always, the bit of Ron's smile and Ron's face in my heart.
About 2,000 projectors shone images onto buildings and giant screens up to 1,200 feet (370 m) high, transforming the city's skyscrapers into spectacular backdrops for an elaborate display of fireworks and lasers. Rendez-vous Houston entered the Guinness Book of Records for its audience of over 1.5 million, beating his earlier record, set in 1979. The display was so impressive that a nearby freeway was blocked by passing vehicles, forcing the authorities to close it for the duration of the concert. Several months later he performed to an audience of about a million at his home city of Lyon, in celebration of a visit by Pope John Paul II. Watching from Lyon Cathedral, the Pope began the concert with a good-night blessing, a recording of which appears on Cities in Concert – Houston/Lyon.

In 1988, Jarre released his ninth studio album Revolutions, and in same year, a concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September, to be held at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council delayed their decision until 12 September the month in which the show was due to take place. The local fire service were also concerned about access in the event of a fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on 8 and 9 October.
The floating stage on which Jarre and his musicians performed was built on top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, and one of the buildings to be used as a backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000 people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.

1990s
In 1990, Jarre released En Attendant Cousteau (Waiting for Cousteau), a tribute to the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. On Bastille Day he performed a concert at La Défense in Paris, attended by a record-breaking audience of about two million people, again beating his earlier world record. He later promoted a concert near the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, to be held during the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991. However, with only weeks to go, important equipment had not arrived and the sinking in the Atlantic Ocean of a cargo ship containing the purpose-built pyramidal stage and other technical and financial problems made staging the concert impossible. Jarre's disappointment was such that he ""could not cope with Mexican food for two years"".
About two years later he released Chronologie, an album that features Jarre's traditional collection of instruments like the ARP 2600 and Minimoog, as well as newer synthesisers such as the Roland JD-800 and the Kurzweil K2000.

In the state of mind I did Chronologie, it's quite close to what I did for Oxygène, using a lot of the old synthesizers of the '70s, like the Moog synthesizer — which I consider to be the Stradivarius of electronic music — mixed with the digital sound and the beat of the dance scene of the '90s. In a sense, Chronologie is a kind of mixture between the sounds of the '70s and the sounds of the '90s.

Jarre was invited to the inaugural celebrations of the Palace of the Lost City, a hotel located within the Sun City in South Africa. Three concerts were held on 1, 2 and 3 December 1992, in which more than 45,000 people attended.
Chronologie was performed at a series of 16 performances across Europe called Europe in Concert. These were on a smaller scale than his previous concerts, featuring a miniature skyline, laser imaging and fireworks. Locations included Lausanne, Mont St Michel, London, Manchester, Barcelona, Seville and the Versailles Palace near Paris. A concert was also held in Hong Kong in March 1994, to mark the opening of the city's new stadium. Jarre performed many of his most well-known hits at the Concert for Tolerance on Bastille Day in 1995, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The Eiffel Tower was specially lit for the occasion, prompting the installation of a more permanent display. The following December, he created the website ""A Space for Tolerance"", which featured music from En Attendant Cousteau, played while the user browsed a variety of ""visual worlds"".
In 1997, Jarre returned to the analogue synthesisers of the 1970s with Oxygène 7–13, dedicated to his mentor at the GRM, Pierre Schaeffer, who had died two years before. In September that year he set his fourth record for the largest-ever outdoor-concert audience with a performance at the Moscow State University, celebrating the 850th anniversary of Moscow. The event was viewed by an audience of about 3.5 million. Another large-scale concert followed on 31 December 1999, in the Egyptian desert near Giza. The Twelve Dreams of the Sun celebrated the new millennium and offered a preview of his next album, Métamorphoses (released the following year). The show featured performances from more than 1,000 local artists and musicians, and was based on ancient Egyptian mythology about the journey of the Sun and its effect upon humanity. In 1998, British commercial broadcaster ITV used a remixed version of ""Fourth Rendez-Vous"" (called Rendez-Vous 98) for their television coverage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. British group Apollo 440 were credited alongside Jarre for the remix.

2000s
In 2001, he released Interior Music, an album of 1,000 copies created for use by the Danish audio-visual company Bang & Olufsen stores. The album consists of two long-form pieces: ""Bonjour Hello"", is a 25 minute audio collage of sounds with voices saying short sentences in French, English and Danish. The second piece, ""Whispers of Life"", is an instrumental version of the first, with the voices removed.

The same year he composed, with Francis Rimbert arrangements, the music for the short-lived French channel Match TV. On 7 September 2002, Jarre held a very wet and muddy concert at the Gammel Vrå Enge near the city of Aalborg in Denmark, with 40,000 spectators (including 5,000 VIPs). Danish band Safri Duo featured on the track ""Aero"", which in fact was Bourges 2 from the performance earlier that year, and Rendez-Vous 4. The concert was broadcast live on various TV stations around the world and a shortened one-hour version was made available for rebroadcast.
By no fault of Jarre, due to 22 millimeters of rain and lack of proper preparation for and execution of the event, it took several hours for all people to be able to leave the area, and many cars were stuck until the next day. The problems subsequently became a big issue in Danish media, since, had there been an accident, it would be extremely difficult for help to get to the location. Two years previously, nine people were killed at Roskilde Festival, which had brought focus on security at large concerts. Preparations for AERO were later proven to have been lacking, and the police investigation concluded, in part, that permission for the concert should not have been granted. Reactions from spectators were mixed, some claiming it was unsafe, and others saying it was a case of overreacting.
A concert in September of that same year at a wind farm near Aalborg in Denmark proved problematic when 22 mm of rain fell on the venue, causing long delays for spectators. It also marked a change in direction in Jarre's live concerts; from Rendez-vous Houston onwards he had been accompanied by a full complement of live musicians, but at Aalborg he was accompanied only by Francis Rimbert, and having guests like the Klarup Girls Choir, Safri Duo and the Aalborg Symphonic Orchestra.
In 2003 he released Geometry of Love on Warner Music label, it was commissioned by Jean-Roch as soundtrack for his 'V.I.P. Room' nightclub in France. The physical CD was a long time out of print, but in 2018 remastered reissue was released on CD again. The album cover is a pixelated and turned counter-clockwise photo of Jarre's girlfriend at the time, Isabelle Adjani.
In October 2004 he returned to China to open its ""Year of France"" cultural exchange. Jarre gave two performances, the first at the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City, and the second in Tiananmen Square. More than 15,000 spectators watched the concert at the Meridian Gate, and each concert was transmitted nationwide on live television. Jarre collaborated with musician Chen Lin. Accompanying his traditional musical repertoire, 600 projectors shone coloured light and images across various screens and objects.

In September 2004, Jarre released both a DVD and a CD in one package AERO. A compilation album made in 5.1 surround sound, it contains re-recorded versions of some of his most famous tracks, including tracks from Oxygène and Équinoxe. Accompanying the audio, the DVD features a visual image of Anne Parillaud's eyes, recorded in real time as she listened to the album. Jarre used the minimalist imagery to reinforce the audio content of the DVD.In his role of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, Jarre performed a concert named Water for Life in Morocco, on 16 December 2006, to celebrate the United Nations Year of Desertification in the world. The performance was in front of the Erg Chebbi Dunes of Merzouga, in the Sahara. A free event, it was attended by about 25,000 people. Images of water and the environment were projected onto nine vertical screens, held in place by sand which was watered to keep it hard. Several permanent drinking fountains were built on the site, along with a permanent electricity installation. Jarre was accompanied by over 60 Moroccan artists. Jarre released Téo & Téa in 2007, a studio album that described the different stages of a loving relationship.
In that same year released on EMI label a new recording of his 1976 album named Oxygène: New Master Recording. Jarre performed 10 concerts (Oxygène Live) in December 2007, held in the Théâtre Marigny, located in the Champs-Élysées, Paris. Later in 2008 Jarre performed several concerts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Oxygène, in theaters in Europe. Following one such performance at the Royal Albert Hall Jarre met Queen guitarist Brian May, who proposed he create a concert in Tenerife for the International Year of Astronomy, but a lack of sponsorship meant that the concert did not take place. In 2009 he was selected as the artistic director of the World Sky Race, and also accepted a role as Goodwill Ambassador for the International Year of Astronomy. In 2009 he started an indoor tour in arenas throughout Europe.

2010s
On 1 March 2010, Jean-Michel Jarre started the second leg of his 2009–10 Indoors tour; on 10 June, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Mojo magazine. On 1 July 2011, Jarre performed a large-scale concert in Monaco to celebrate the marriage of Prince Albert and his bride Charlene. A later concert was held at Carthage during the city's 12 August 2013 musical festival.
In June 2013, Jarre was elected as president of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC). In Spring 2015, Jarre released the first music from a new studio album, released in October 2015, following around four years of work. The album, Electronica 1: The Time Machine (working title: E-Project), comprises a number of collaborations with other artists. The first of these to be released was the collaboration with Gesaffelstein entitled Conquistador, followed by Glory, with M83. The track was also featured as part of the soundtrack of a short film entitled EMIC.
Other collaborations on the album include Tangerine Dream for Zero Gravity; Armin van Buuren for ""Stardust"", John Carpenter for ""A Question of Blood"", Little Boots for If..! and Pete Townshend for Travelator, Pt. 2. The album became Jarre's first album in over 25 years to make the UK Top 10 at No. 8. In December 2016, the album was nominated for the Grammys 2017 Awards in the ""Best Dance/Electronic Album"" category. In June 2015, in collaboration with Jean-Michel Jarre, the transmedia project Soundhunters was released on the platform of the Franco-German channel ARTE. The transmedia conceptualized by the Blies brothers (Stéphane Hueber-Blies and Nicolas Blies), François Le Gall and Marion Guth of the Luxembourg production company a_BAHN, is openly inspired by the album Zoolook to which it pays tribute.
On 5 October 2016, Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 announced that Jarre would be a member of its advisory panel. The transmedia is composed of a web documentary using Zoolook's creative process involving 4 international artists (Simonne Jones, Mikael Seifu, Daedelus and Luke Vibert); a 52' documentary film directed by Beryl Koltz broadcast in September 2015 on ARTE (with the participation of Chassol, Matthew Herbert, Blixa Bargeld, Jean-Michel Jarre, Matmos, Kiz, Joseph Bertolozzi); and finally a participatory tribute music album whose tracks were chosen by Jean-Michel Jarre, entitled Zoolook Revisited. Soundhunters won the Fipa d'Or 2015 in Biarritz. Soundhunters was also presented in conference at SXSW and Convergence NYFF 2016.
In 2016, Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise was released with 15 more collaborators, including Pet Shop Boys, Hans Zimmer, Yello and Gary Numan. One track (8 ""Exit"") includes speech by Edward Snowden. Electronica 2 has been nominated in the Album de musiques électroniques ou dance category for the Grammy 2017 in USA & Victoires de la Musique 2017 awards in France. On 11 April 2016, it was revealed that Jarre worked in collaboration with British virtual band Gorillaz on their fifth studio album Humanz. He also composed during 2016 the soundtrack for the French news network France Info. This soundtrack was released as Radiophonie Vol. 9 on 13 January 2017.
In 2017, he performed a concert near the fortress of Masada, for the purpose of saving the Dead Sea and to highlight ""the anti-environmental policies of Donald Trump."" He also performed a special concert for the opening of the Año Jubilar (Jubilee year) at the Monasterio de Santo Toribio de Liébana, in Spain. Both concerts were heavily based in the Electronica Tour concept. During May 2017, Jarre toured in Canada and USA for the first time in his career, and in July 2017 another leg of the tour was held in Europe.
In March 2018, Jarre performed in South America for the first time as part of his Electronica Tour in Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. These concerts were originally scheduled for November 2017, but problems with the production company caused the rescheduling. The 2018 leg of the tour continued in Canada and the United States during April, including the presentation of the Electronica show with a reduced track list in the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, ending with a one-off concert at Riyadh to celebrate the 88th Saudi National Day (23 September). This concert was called ""The Green Concert"", and involved laser projections on the skyscrapers of the financial center of Riyadh. In September 2018, a studio compilation album entitled Planet Jarre – 50 Years of Music, consisting of forty-one songs in ""four quite different styles of composition"", was released.

On 26 November 2018, Jarre and Scott Kirkland of The Crystal Method announced that they would be collaborating on a track on Jarre's next Electronica album. In January 2019, HSBC revealed their new musical identity, composed by Jarre. On 3 October 2019, French editor Robert Laffont published Melancolique Rodeo, Jarre's autobiography. Jarre started a promotional tour for his book. On 7 November 2019, Jarre announced the release of an application for the iOS operating system named EōN. This application contains morphing graphics created by an algorithm developed by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, and music generated from 7 hours of recorded material by Jarre. This music is always different on every device. The AI algorithm which composes on the fly based on the rules set by Jarre was developed by BLEASS. A limited deluxe box set was later released with excerpts from the application.

2020–present
On 31 December 2020, Jarre held a virtual New Year's Eve concert online. He performed from a studio in Paris, but it appeared virtually from a Notre Dame setting. The show has had over 75 million viewers as of 5 January 2021. The show was done in support of his new album ""Welcome to the other side,"" which features 12 tracks from his previously released music. The recording of the concert was released on CD, LP and Blu-ray in September 2021. VR Concert created by VRROOM received 2 Webby Award Honoree, Crystal Owl Award for the Best Live Entertainment Archived 14 January 2022 at the Wayback Machine, and Social Music Award.
On 21 June 2021, Jarre was awarded Commander to the Legion of Honour by French president Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée presidential palace in Paris. After the ceremony he performed at the same venue as part of the Fête de la Musique. In March 2022 Jarre presented a live project, Oxymore, at Radio France's Hyper Weekend Festival located at Paris.

Flying aircar mission
On april 23, 2024, Jean-Michel Jarre became the world’s first passenger to take off in KleinVision’s flying AirCar.

Personal life
Jarre was married to Flore Guillard from 1975 until 1977. He met his second wife, actress Charlotte Rampling, at a dinner party in St Tropez in 1976. The two married, and Jarre gained custody of his daughter Émilie Charlotte, while Rampling got the same of her son Barnaby; together Jarre and Rampling had a son, David. Jarre and Rampling separated in 1996 and divorced in 2002. He had a brief relationship with Isabelle Adjani, and married French actress Anne Parillaud in May 2005. In November 2010 the couple announced their divorce. 
Jarre started dating Chinese actress Gong Li in 2016. They got married in 2019, and have kept the relationship private.
Jarre has a half-sister, Stéphanie Jarre, from one of Maurice Jarre's other marriages. His stepbrother, Kevin Jarre, died in 2011. Although Maurice and Jean-Michel remained estranged, following Maurice's death in 2009, Jarre paid tribute to his legacy.
Jarre said about his father: ""My father and I never really achieved a real relationship. We probably saw each other 20 or 25 times in our lifetime. When you are able, at my age, to count the times you have seen your father, it says something. (...) I think it's better to have conflict, or, if you have a parent who dies, you grieve, but the feeling of absence is very difficult to fill, and it took me a while to absorb that"".

Jeff Johnson (musician),"Jeff Johnson (born 1956) is a recording artist, composer and producer who has released numerous solo and collaborative recordings. Born near Portland, Oregon, he currently resides in the San Juan Islands in the state of Washington
His early work was vocal progressive-rock, but his sound has since evolved to jazz, new-age, instrumental, contemplative and Celtic styles. He has collaborated with other established musicians, including Sandy Simpson, Brian Dunning, and Phil Keaggy. His works also include several musical releases based on books penned by fantasy author Stephen Lawhead.
In addition to recording, Johnson is active in the ongoing Selah Service music and contemplative worship events, featuring music, readings from the Psalms and silent prayer.

Vocal Recordings
Johnson's early vocal recordings were stylistically progressive rock. The lyrics were inspired by a diverse group of authors, artists and historical figures including C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, George MacDonald, Blaise Pascal, Francis Schaeffer, Tom Stoppard, William Shakespeare, Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Ludwig II of Bavaria.
His first recording efforts, The Anvil Of God's Word and Please Forgive Us, Lord were recorded in 1976, when he was a ""young teenager"" and were never officially released on CD. After many years, they were made available on a CD entitled Early Songs as part of the ArkMusic Special Editions series.
His first studio album, Face of the Deep (1980), managed to conjure aural landscapes in the ears of his listeners with his synthesizer infused progressive rock renditions of fantasy works. The album begins with the pensive image of Rodin's The Thinker. Songs are inspired by writings such as Charles Williams' All Hallows' Eve, and by the paintings of Gauguin and Renoir's The Moulin de la Galette. Johnson completes his treatment of these aural landscapes with on-location recordings of atmospheric sounds such as rain storms and creaking gates - incorporating them into the music in an artful way.
On his second album, he collaborated with Sandy Simpson to record Through the Door (1982), which took up the theme of spiritual quest inspired by the novels of George MacDonald (The Golden Key). It also continued the use of synthesizers in the slightly sci-fi themed song, The Jupiter Effect. It was also on this album that Johnson first recorded his personal 'theme' - 'Someday someday' — a song he would record in several versions throughout his discography.
Johnson continued the theme of the spiritual quest on albums such as: Fallen Splendour and Pilgrimage. Incorporating influences from several of the Inklings, including a song inspired by C.S. Lewis — Dream of the Island (Similitudes).
His more recent vocal works are more liturgically inspired. Lyrics include passages from the Biblical Psalms as well as prayers by early Irish saints Columba and Patrick as well as Teresa of Ávila and Francis of Assisi.

Instrumental Recordings
Johnson's instrumental releases cover a broad spectrum of Celtic, new-age, jazz and world music genres.
His collaborations with Irish flutist, Brian Dunning, include music inspired by the stories of Stephen R. Lawhead as well as a series of Celtic Christmas releases which were licensed by Windham Hill for that label's Winter Solstice and Celtic Christmas compilations.
He also collaborated on several releases with Portland bassist David Friesen, and additional releases with guitarist Phil Keaggy.
In 2018, he released Eirlandia, an instrumental release of Modern Irish music. The album was inspired by the Stephen R. Lawhead novel of the same name.
In 2019, he will be releasing  a third collaborative work with Keaggy, a collection called Cappadocia, inspired by Johnson's recent visits to Turkey.

Musical style
Johnson's versatility has been praised: 

Johnsons's music has been dubbed 'intelligent pop', 'new age', and 'jazz lite' — but he is quick to point out that his records have nothing to do with the New Age movement. ""I was doing my style of music before anybody was talking about the New Age Movement."" 
Sample any of his 50 albums that he has recorded and sold through Ark Records, and you’ll hear hints of Irish folk, modern pop, jazz, mystical world music, and historical Christmas tunes. He’s recorded concept albums based on Stephen Lawhead books, ancient prayers, and iconic figures. All of this variety isn’t just to be clever; rather it’s a celebration of the many nuances that good music can absorb. 
There is thought and purpose behind every note here that makes you feel like you are seeing different shades of nature while floating along a river. 
Through his career, Johnson has collaborated with a diverse range of artists and musicians. In 1991, he played with Derri Daugherty (The Choir); jazz players David Friesen and Dave Hagelganz; and rock drummer Mark Schulman.
Classical singer and soprano Janet Chvatal performs Latin chant on the album 'Psalmus' and atmospheric vocals on several instrumental albums.
In 2002, he contributed an original tune with Brian Dunning on the Gangs of New York (soundtrack), alongside artists such as Peter Gabriel.
His work with flutist Brian Dunning first began on the 1991 album Great Romantics and continued through several albums, including the 2018 release ""Eirlandia.""  The Smooth Jazz Ride calls the collaboration on Erilandia, ""a great reunion of musical minds bent on excellence."" |The Smooth Jazz Ride
In 2009, he contributed the track ""Heaven's Door"" for Eckhart Tolle's Music to Quiet the Mind. He appeared with Keaggy on the instrumental albums Frio Suite (2009), and Water Sky (2012) - chosen for the 25 Essential Echoes CDs: The Best of 2012. A third collaboration with Keaggy is scheduled for Spring 2019.
Johnson's recordings have been licensed and featured on numerous commercials, compilations, spoken word and movie soundtracks including the Martin Scorsese film, ""Gangs of New York,"" Ruth Bell Graham’s ""A Quiet Knowing,"" the Hearts of Space ""Celtic Twilight"" and Windham Hill ""Winter Solstice"" and ""Celtic Christmas"" series, Eckhart Tolle’s ""Music to Quiet the Mind,"" Angela Elwell Hunt’s ""The Tale of Three Trees,"" Keith Patman's ""Centerpoint: Poetry & Music for Christmas and Scott Cairn’s ""Parable"".
Johnson produced an album of original music for Mercedes-Benz, titled Rhythms of the Road. The company included a CD with every new car sold. In an interview with The High Calling, Johnson said he was contacted by a car owner who totaled her Mercedes, with the CD stuck in the player. 'She was more upset about losing her CD than losing her car,' he said. Johnson sent her another copy.""

Ark Records
Ark Records publishes Johnson's albums and those of a few musical associates.
Jeff Johnson produced music since his early teens, and started Ark Records in ""a small studio in our house with a friend back in 1977"" (Tigard, Oregon).  Learning the recording process in a pre-PC age helped him hone his skills. ""Back then, it was all tape-based and the curve was high in learning how to record, edit and mix music."" Ark Records has produced and distributed more than 50 albums.
Around 1998, Johnson moved Ark Records to the San Juan Islands in Washington State.

Jon Hassell,"Jon Hassell (March 22, 1937 – June 26, 2021) was an American trumpet player and composer. He was best known for developing the concept of ""Fourth World"" music, which describes a ""unified primitive/futurist sound"" combining elements of various world ethnic traditions with modern electronic techniques. The concept was first articulated on Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics, his 1980 collaboration with Brian Eno.
Born in Tennessee, Hassell studied contemporary classical music in New York and later in Germany under composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. He subsequently worked with minimalist composers Terry Riley (on a 1968 recording of In C) and La Monte Young (as part of his Theatre of Eternal Music group), and studied under Hindustani singer Pandit Pran Nath. His association with Brian Eno in the early 1980s would introduce Hassell to a larger audience. He subsequently worked with musical artists such as Talking Heads, David Sylvian, Farafina, Peter Gabriel, Tears for Fears, Ani DiFranco, Techno Animal, Ry Cooder, Moritz von Oswald, and Carl Craig.

Life and career
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, Hassell received his master's degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. During this time he became involved in European serial music, especially the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and so after finishing his studies at Eastman, he enrolled in the Cologne Course for New Music (founded and directed by Stockhausen) for two years, where he met Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, who would later go on to form Can . Hassell returned to the U.S. in 1967, where he met Terry Riley in Buffalo, New York, and performed on the first recording of Riley's seminal work In C in 1968. He pursued his Ph.D. in musicology in Buffalo and performed in La Monte Young's Theatre of Eternal Music in New York City, contributing to the 1974 LP Dream House 78' 17"".
On his return to Buffalo in the early 1970s, Hassell was introduced to the music of Indian Pandit Pran Nath, a specialist in the Kiranic style of singing. Hassell, Young, Marian Zazeela, and Riley went together to India to study with Nath. His work with Nath awoke his appetite for traditional musics of the world, and on the album Vernal Equinox, he used his trumpet (treated with various electronic effects) to imitate the vocal techniques to which Nath had exposed him. He stated:

""From 1973 up until then I was totally immersed in playing raga on the trumpet. I wanted the physical dexterity to be able to come into a room and be able to do something that nobody else in the world could do. My aim was to make a music that was vertically integrated in such a way that at any cross-sectional moment you were not able to pick a single element out as being from a particular country or genre of music.""
In 1980, he collaborated with Brian Eno on the album Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics and appeared on the Eno-produced Talking Heads album Remain in Light. The same year Hassell also performed solo at the Mudd Club. Plans had been made with Eno and David Byrne for the three of them to team up for what became ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts,"" but the plan fell through when Hassell didn't agree with the direction the tracks were taking. His 1981 release, Dream Theory in Malaya, led to a performance at the first World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) Festival, organized by Peter Gabriel. He performed and co-wrote tracks on David Sylvian's first solo album Brilliant Trees, and its instrumental EP follow-up Words with the Shaman. In the late 1980s, Hassell contributed to Gabriel's Passion, the soundtrack album for Martin Scorsese's film, The Last Temptation of Christ. Hassell and Pete Scaturro composed the electronic theme music for the television show The Practice.
In 1989, Hassell contributed to the Tears for Fears album The Seeds of Love.
Hassell died from natural causes on June 26, 2021, at the age of 84. He had had health issues over the course of the previous year.

Style
Hassell coined the term ""Fourth World"" to describe his work on ""a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques."" He used extensive electronic processing of his trumpet playing. In addition to nonwestern traditional musics, critics have noted the influence of Miles Davis on Hassell's style, particularly Davis' use of electronics, modal harmony, minimal vibrato and understated lyricism. Both on record and during live performances, Hassell made use of western instruments—keyboards, bass, electric guitar, and percussion—to create modal, hypnotic grooves, over which he often played microtonally-inflected trumpet phrases in the style of Nath's Kiranic vocals. His use of circular breathing on the instrument enabled him to create long, seamless, and mesmerizing melodic lines.

Jonn Serrie,"Jonn Serrie is an American composer of space music, a genre of ambient electronic music, and New Age music. He has recorded at least 18 albums and worked on projects for Lucasfilm, IMAX Corporation, NASA, the United States Navy, Hayden Planetarium, Expo Seville, and CNN.

Musical career
Serrie has been composing and performing music for planetariums since the early 1980s. His first widely available album, And the Stars Go With You, was in memory of the astronauts lost in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The following album, Flightpath, contains six songs that commemorate the pre-space-age test pilots of Edwards Air Force Base in the 1950s. Jonn is a pilot with advanced instrument and commercial ratings and flies for the Civil Air Patrol as a search-and-rescue pilot.
Serrie's next album, Tingri, was based on a remote village in Tibet. It was his way of infusing more spiritual and romantic emotion into his music. In so doing, he strayed a bit from his space music roots but without sacrificing his trademark sound. In 1992 and 1994, he made two albums in which he put his earlier planetarium work from the 1980s on CD, on Planetary Chronicles, Volume 1 and Planetary Chronicles, Volume 2. In between, in 1993 and 1995, Serrie composed his own musical science fiction story based on a fictional Century Princess in Midsummer Century and Ixlandia. In 1993, he submitted a song from his planetarium collection called ""Soft Landing"" to a Various Artists album sponsored largely by Steve Roach, a prominent electronic musician. This song is only available on this recording. In 1997, Serrie's first Christmas album Upon a Midnight Clear was released; he rearranged known and less-known Christmas songs from around the world in his unique style. Due to its popularity, Serrie released two more Christmas albums, Yuletides in 2001 and Merrily on High in 2004.
In 1998, Serrie collaborated with David Carradine on his tai chi video series and released a CD soundtrack based on the videos, called ""Dream Journeys"". Also in 1998, he took a trip to shamanic America, which resulted in his musical collaboration with several Native American elders on ""Spirit Keepers"".
In 1999, Serrie appeared as a special guest of honor at the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission, which was held in Cape Canaveral. As the final act of the after-dinner entertainment, he played a specially composed song ""Out of the Blue"", which has not been officially released.
The year 2000 brought Serrie's ""best of"" space music compilation, Century Seasons. On this album two new songs appeared, although ""Deep Mystery"" reappeared on ""Lumia Nights"" two years later in a slightly shorter version. The other bonus track, ""Andromeda Dream"", appeared on this album. In 2000 Serrie collaborated with flutist Gary Stroutsos on the Narada label, on an album called Hidden World.
Since 2000, several of Serrie's albums have appeared on independent labels. 2002 brought Lumia Nights, a space romance release on Valley Entertainment, composed in the style of Ixlandia and Midsummer Century. In 2003, he signed a contract with New World Music, a major label in England, which included the reissue of his earlier Miramar releases. 2003 also brought The Stargazer's Journey with liner notes from famed astronomer David H. Levy. This was a return to form in Serrie's more traditional space music style.
Serrie took an interesting musical turn in 2005 with Epiphany, Meditations on Sacred Hymns, featuring his arrangement of traditional hymns and psalms, which he dedicated to his grandmother, his primary childhood church organ and piano teacher. He followed this up in 2006 with Sunday Morning, an independent release for autistic children and their parents. A portion of the profits from this CD goes to support for autism organizations in the United States.
Also in 2006, music from one of his albums was used in the hit Hollywood movie What the Bleep Do We Know!? Serrie scored the award-winning IMAX short film  Hubble: Galaxies Across Space and Time as well as the popular astronomy software program Starry Nights and Space.com's Eyes on Mars DVD.
In 2009, Serrie released the album Thousand Star.
In 2011 the album Sunday Morning was expected be released, available worldwide.
In 2014 the album ""Day Star"" was released available worldwide on New World Music
In 2017 the album ""The Sentinel"" was released available worldwide on New World Music
Jonn Serrie founded the Galaxy Music Scholarship in 2001, a US$1000 annual scholarship for graduating high school seniors desiring a career in new age and space music composition. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.

Echo Orbiter,"Echo Orbiter is a Philadelphia-based indie rock band founded by brothers Justin Emerle and Colin Emerle, described by Philadelphia Weekly as being ""Widely considered two of the most inventive songwriters on the Philadelphia scene.""

History
20th century
Echo Orbiter formed in 1996 in Westville, New Jersey when brothers Justin Emerle and Colin Emerle began performing with drummer Jeremiah Steffen.  Still in high school, the band entered Miner St. Studios in Philadelphia to record their first album, A Moment In Life That’s Right.  Engineered by Brian McTear, the album was “a consistent incorporation of pleasingly-textured pop tunes.” with what one writer called a resemblance to “Guided by Voices when they made albums that didn’t suck.”
Soon after the release of their first album, the appearance of the track “Spring is Here” on a compilation of Philadelphia’s newly emerging indie bands helped EO gain a spot at the Philadelphia PopFest in 1998 and 1999, and a headlining spot at the PopFest in 2000.  The band received widespread coverage after “group members pummeled a giant cardboard robot head, obliterated a couple of guitars and violently dismantled their drum kit,” while destroying the venue’s stage equipment in a ""Who-like"" manner at the 1999 PopFest.
The band reentered Miner St./Cycle Sound Studios in 1999 and recorded their second album, Laughing All The While, which was again engineered by Brian McTear and partly co-engineered by Kurt Heasley of Lilys.  EO began associating with Elephant 6 Collective, appearing on compilations with of Montreal, often performing with Beulah, of Montreal, and the Minders, and releasing a split-45 with Calvin, Don't Jump!.

21st century
In 2001, the band was in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, touring with the Starlight Mints, when the September 11 attacks abruptly ended the tour. Following the broken tour, along with the theft of their instruments, EO discontinued playing live shows altogether, last performing in Providence, Rhode Island, on September 18, 2001, and not returning until nine years later to the day.
Although no longer performing live, brothers Justin and Colin continued to record prolifically.   During this period the band recorded music for Eventide Production’s short-film Mortality  and Get-Kinetic’s short-film 4.50   and appeared on over a dozen compilations by various record labels, including their “life affirming” cover of Medicine's “Never Click” on Never Lose That Feeling  released in the United Kingdom and Japan on Claire Records and on Club AC30 in the United States.
During this time EO also recorded 6 albums, 3 EP's, 5 singles, and 9 full-length compilation albums to accompany the albums and EP's, “clocking up 15 years at the coalface of indiedom” with a prolific ""collection of superb three-minute pop bursts....""
In 2010, Echo Orbiter released their ninth Studio album, Euphonicmontage.  The album’s experimental nature mixed a range of influences from writer Ayn Rand to The Flaming Lips.  The album was recorded to reflect the same Cubist style of Picasso’s paintings in music form and was described as “an innovative landmark in the world of indie rock.”  In 2010 EO also appeared on Sick of the Radio’s New Wave Moons: R. Stevie Moore Tribute  along with Ariel Pink and XTC’s Dave Gregory, and represented the United States on Indiecater Record's Fast Forward  compilation for the FIFA World Cup in South Africa.
Working along with Green Light Go Publicity to promote Euphonicmontage, Echo Orbiter played their first show in 9 years at Johnny Brenda’s in Philadelphia with Joe Jack Talcum of The Dead Milkmen on September 18, 2010, 9 years to the day of their last show, and were highlighted as a Cover Story in the Music Issue of the Philadelphia City Paper.  They followed up the year with More Batteries, an EP recorded entirely on a hacked iPhone.
In 2012, EO appeared along with artists including Sean Lennon, Matt Pond, Cornershop, Elf Power, and Ra Ra Riot in Rock Torch Volume One, a book of artists on artists, and released a free EP called Aerosol Power, which was recorded in a cabin in the Pocono Mountains in Northeastern Pennsylvania during the winter of 2011 on a four-track reel-to-reel.

Jóhann Jóhannsson,"Jóhann Gunnar Jóhannsson (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈjouːhan ˈjouːhansɔn]; 19 September 1969 – 9 February 2018) was an Icelandic composer who wrote music for a wide array of media including theatre, dance, television, and film. His work is stylised by its blending of traditional orchestration with contemporary electronic elements.
Jóhann released solo albums from 2002 onward. In 2016, he signed with Deutsche Grammophon, through which he released his last solo album, Orphée. Some of his works in film include the original scores for Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival, and James Marsh's The Theory of Everything. Jóhannsson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for both The Theory of Everything and Sicario, and won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score for the former. He was a music and sound consultant on Mother!, directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2017. His scores for Mary Magdalene and Mandy were released posthumously.
His only directorial work, Last and First Men, premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2017, where he also performed the score live with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.

Early life and career
Jóhann was born on 19 September 1969 in Reykjavík, Iceland, to Jóhann Gunnarsson, a maintenance engineer who worked for IBM, and Edda Thorkelsdóttir. He learned the piano and trombone from the age of 11, but had given them up during his teenage years. Jóhann attended the University of Iceland, where he studied languages and literature.
Jóhann started his musical career in the late 1980s in the proto-shoegaze-influenced band Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, who released a couple of EPs which were played by British DJ John Peel and received a fan letter from Steve Albini. He went on to work as a guitarist and producer playing in Icelandic indie rock bands, like Olympia, Unun and Ham. In 1999, Jóhann co-founded Kitchen Motors;  a think tank, art organisation and music label that encouraged interdisciplinary collaborations between artists from punk, jazz, classical, metal and electronic music. His own sound arose out of these musical experimentations.

Solo works
Jóhann's first solo album, Englabörn, was a suite based on the music written for the theatre piece of the same name. Jóhann approached the composition by recording string instruments and processing them through digital filters, which allowed him to deconstruct the recordings and reassemble them. The album combined holy minimalism, Satie, Purcell and Moondog with the electronic music of labels such as Mille Plateaux and Mego. Pitchfork gave Englabörn a score of 8.9, and described it as ""exceptionally restrained, the piano moving like droplets off of slowly melting icicles, the violin breathing warmth from above. The hesitation of each breath and falling bead feels as though it were a Morton Feldman piece condensed to three minutes.""
For his second album, Virðulegu Forsetar, an hour-long ambient piece, Jóhann used an orchestra of 11 brass players, glockenspiel, piano and organ, with added bells and electronics, creating a sound that combined classical, ambient and experimental music.
IBM 1401, A User's Manual, Jóhann's fourth studio album, was released on 30 October 2006 on the 4AD label. It was inspired by his father, an IBM engineer and one of Iceland's first computer programmers, who used early hardware to compose melodies during his downtime at work. Jóhann used sounds produced from the electromagnetic emissions of the IBM 1401 as part of the composition.
Fordlandia, Jóhann's sixth full-length studio album, was released in November 2008 via 4AD, and was thematically influenced by the failure of Henry Ford's Brazilian rubber plant Fordlândia.
In 2010, Jóhann collaborated with filmmaker Bill Morrison on The Miners' Hymns (2011), a film and accompanying composition for a brass band, pipe organ and electronics, based on coal-mining in County Durham. The film was noted for celebrating ""social, cultural, and political aspects of the extinct industry, and the strong regional tradition of colliery brass bands"". The overall piece was itself a tribute to the miners strikes which occurred in the area during the 1980s. The piece premiered live in Durham Cathedral in July 2010 and was released on CD and DVD in May 2011. The album was described by the BBC as ""a gorgeous brass-based requiem for northeast England's former mining community"". Writing in The Observer, Fiona Maddocks gave the London debut performance of the score at the Barbican five stars, writing, ""The strange counterpoint between an Icelandic minimalist, an American filmmaker and a bitter episode in recent British history has resulted in a work as unclassifiable as it is unforgettable.""
In 2021 the Gold Dust EP was released, containing unused pieces from various previous projects.
On 15th Sept 2023, the posthumous album Prayer to the Dynamo was released on Bandcamp. This contained suites from Sicario and The Theory of Everything and was performed by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra.

Film work
Jóhann had scored a number of works concurrent with his solo career through the 2000s including the Icelandic comedy Dis in 2004, TV series Svartir englar in 2007, and In the Arms of My Enemy in 2007. However it is his work with Denis Villeneuve for which he is best known. His first collaboration with Villeneuve was Prisoners in 2013. He subsequently worked on Villeneuve's films Sicario (2015), which was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Score, and Arrival (2016). Jóhann joined Villeneuve once again to work on Blade Runner 2049, but at some point during production Villeneuve decided that the music needed a change in direction. In describing the artistic process for Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve stated that ""the movie needed something different, and I needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis. Jóhann and I decided that I will need to go in another direction.""  Villeneuve brought in Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to complete the project. Jóhann's work on James Marsh's The Theory of Everything won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score in 2015. His final works were for the films Mandy, The Mercy, and Mary Magdalene.  In an interview following the release of Arrival, Jóhann commented on his process stating that ""it's about putting yourself in a receptive state of mind where you react to inputs, and it can be from anywhere.  It doesn't really matter if you're writing for film or if you're doing your own piece; you always have to put yourself into that space."" He went on to say, ""there are practical parameters, of course, involved in writing film music rather than doing your own album, but I view them very much as the same body of work. And, for me, there are very clear lines for me between Englabörn to Arrival.""
Prior to his death he had been hired to compose the score for Disney's Christopher Robin, but died before he had begun work on it.
His only feature film directed by himself, Last and First Men, premiered two years after his death at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, where it received widespread acclaim.

Collaborations and other projects
In March 2015, Jóhann teamed up with ACME (American Contemporary Music Ensemble) and the Grammy Award-winning vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth to perform Drone Mass. described as a contemporary oratorio, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His list of collaborators included Tim Hecker, Hildur Guðnadóttir, Pan Sonic, CAN drummer Jaki Liebezeit, Marc Almond, Barry Adamson, and Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))). In 1999, Jóhann founded the Apparat Organ Quartet, which has released two albums since 2002 with live performances in Europe, America and Japan.

Personal life
Jóhann left Reykjavík in the early 2000s, living in Copenhagen before settling in Kreuzberg, Berlin. He had a daughter, Karolina Jóhannsdóttir, who lives in Copenhagen.
Jóhann died in Berlin on 9 February 2018 at the age of 48. German toxicology reports indicated that a lethal combination of cocaine and flu medication was the likely cause of his death.

Karl Jenkins,"Sir Karl William Pamp Jenkins, , HonFLSW (born 17 February 1944) is a Welsh multi-instrumentalist and composer. His best known works include the song ""Adiemus"" (1995, from the Adiemus album series), Palladio (1995), The Armed Man (2000), his Requiem (2005) and his ""Stabat Mater"" (2008).
Jenkins was educated in music at Cardiff University and the Royal Academy of Music, and he is a fellow and an associate of the latter. He joined the jazz-rock band Soft Machine in 1972 and became the group's lead songwriter in 1974. He continued to work with Soft Machine until 1984, but has not been involved with any incarnation of the group since. He has composed music for advertising campaigns and has won the industry prize twice.

Biography
Early life and education
Jenkins was born and raised in Penclawdd, Gower, Wales (now part of Swansea). His mother was Swedish, and his father was Welsh. He received his initial musical instruction from his father, who was the local schoolteacher, chapel organist and choirmaster. He attended Gowerton Grammar School.
Jenkins studied music at Cardiff University and then commenced postgraduate studies in London at the Royal Academy of Music.

Early career: Graham Collier's group and Nucleus
For the bulk of his early career, Jenkins was known as a jazz and jazz-rock musician, playing baritone and soprano saxophones, keyboards and oboe, an unusual instrument in a jazz context. He joined jazz composer Graham Collier's group and later co-founded the jazz-rock group Nucleus, which won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1970. In 1971, Jenkins collaborated with Linda Hoyle on her album Pieces of Me, co-writing 8 of the 11 tracks, playing piano and oboe, as well as arranging and conducting the orchestra.

Soft Machine
In 1972, Jenkins joined the Canterbury jazz fusion rock band Soft Machine, playing saxophone, oboe and flute along with keyboard instruments. The group played venues including The Proms, Carnegie Hall, and the Newport Jazz Festival. The album Six, on which Jenkins first played with Soft Machine, won the Melody Maker British Jazz Album of the Year award in 1973. Jenkins also won the miscellaneous musical instrument section (as he did the following year). Soft Machine was voted best small group in the Melody Maker jazz poll of 1974. The albums in which Jenkins performed and composed were Six (1973), Seven (1973), Bundles (1975), Softs (1976) and Land of Cockayne (1981). Jenkins was the group's primary composer on Seven and the subsequent three albums.
After Mike Ratledge left the band in 1976, Soft Machine did not include any of its founding members, but kept recording on a project basis with line-ups revolving around Jenkins and drummer John Marshall. Although Melody Maker had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, Hugh Hopper, involved with the group since replacing bassist Kevin Ayers in 1968, cited Jenkins's ""third rate"" musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band, and the band of the late 1970s has been described by band member John Etheridge as wasting its potential.

Other works
In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD.

Works
Jenkins has created advertising music, twice winning the industry prize in that field. From the 1980s, he developed a relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty, starting with composing musics for their Levi's jeans ""Russian"" series. He composed a classical theme used by De Beers diamond merchants for their television advertising campaign focusing on jewellery worn by people otherwise seen only in silhouette. Jenkins later included this as the title track in a compilation called Diamond Music, and eventually created Palladio, using it as the theme of the first movement. Other arrangements have included advertisements for the Renault Clio.
As a composer, his breakthrough came with the crossover project Adiemus. Jenkins has conducted the Adiemus project in Japan, Germany, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as London's Royal Albert Hall and Battersea Power Station. The Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary (1995) album topped the classical album charts. It spawned a series of successors, each revolving around a central theme. In 2014 Jenkins released a tribute song for the 2014 Winter Olympics, performed by his new age music group also called Adiemus.
Jenkins was the first international composer and conductor to conduct the University of Johannesburg Kingsway Choir led by Renette Bouwer, during his visit to South Africa as the choir performed his The Armed Man: A mass for peace together with a 70-piece orchestra.
Jenkins' choral work The Peacemakers was first performed in New York City's Carnegie Hall on 16 January 2012. Jenkins conducted from the podium. The seventeen-movement piece features extracts from religious texts and works by notable humanitarians. A recording was released on 26 March 2012; it features the London Symphony Orchestra and several choirs, as well as guest vocalists and instrumentalists. Additional concerts in the UK and US took place later in the year.

Jenkins composed the music for the 2012 BBC Wales series The Story of Wales presented by Huw Edwards.
A work entitled The Healer – A Cantata For St Luke was premiered on 16 October 2014 (7:30 pm) in St Luke's Church, Grayshott, Hampshire, and was recorded and broadcast on Classic FM. The Healer received its US premiere at Carnegie Hall, New York on 19 January 2015.  In September 2015, the recording of the premiere of The Healer was released on CD by Warner Classics as part of the 8-disc boxed set Voices.
A compilation CD Still with the Music was also released in September 2015, coinciding with the publication of his autobiography of the same name.
On 8 October 2016 Jenkins' choral work Cantata Memoria: For the children, a response to the 1966 Aberfan disaster with a libretto by Mererid Hopwood and commissioned by S4C, premiered at the Wales Millennium Centre. The concert was broadcast the following evening on S4C and was released as an album by Deutsche Grammophon.

Musical style
Lyrics
Many of the songs written by Jenkins have specifically written phonetic lyrics, but they are not in any language. Instead, they are syllables intended to have a musical effect, but not to carry any specific meaning. This glossolalia is similar to the sounds of ""scat singing"", except that this latter artform sometimes emphasises of-the-moment improvisation as well.
The composer has said the lyrics to his ""Adiemus"" series of songs are in ""an invented language"", and have no particular meaning. He has observed, ""The text was written phonetically with the words viewed as instrumental sound, the idea being to maximise the melisma by removing the distraction, if one can call it that, of words”. Some listeners compare his lyrics to the Latin language, but other critics discount such a connection.
Other songs he has written use Biblical or literary texts for the lyrics.

Awards and achievements
Jenkins was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Wales in 2006. He has been made both a fellow (FRAM) and an associate (ARAM) of the Royal Academy of Music] in 2003, and a room has been named in his honour. He also has had fellowships at Cardiff University (2005), the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, Trinity College Carmarthen and Swansea Metropolitan University. In 2022, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales (HonFLSW).
In 2008, Jenkins' The Armed Man was listed as No. 1 in Classic FM's ""Top 10 by living composers"".
He has been awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of Leicester, the Chancellor's Medal by the University of Glamorgan and honorary visiting professorships at Thames Valley University, London College of Music and the ATriUM, Cardiff.
Jenkins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours and promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, in both cases for services to music. In the 2015 Birthday Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor ""for services to Composing and Crossing Musical Genres.""
Jenkins is joint president of the British Double Reed Society and Patron of the International Schools Choral Music Society (ISCMS).
In 2016, Jenkins received the BASCA Gold Badge Award for his unique contribution to music.
Jenkins' work Tros y Garreg (Welsh for Crossing the Stone) was performed at the coronation of King Charles III in 2023, with Jenkins in attendance.

Biography
Essl was born in Vienna. His studies at the University of Music in Vienna included: composition (under Friedrich Cerha), electro-acoustic music (under Dieter Kaufmann) and double bass. At the University of Vienna he studied  musicology (1989 doctoral thesis on Das Synthese-Denken bei Anton Webern). In 1990-94 he was ""composer in residence"" at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse für Neue Musik, while in 1992-93 he worked on a commission at IRCAM in Paris. From 1992 to 2016, he was the music curator of the Essl Collection [1] in Klosterneuburg/Vienna. Between 1995–2006 he taught Algorithmic composition at the Studio for Advanced Music & Media Technology at the Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance in Linz, Austria. As of 2007, Essl is professor of composition for electro-acoustic and experimental music at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.

Characterisation
Karlheinz Essl's work with computers (with emphasis on algorithmic composition and generative music) and a prolonged occupation with the poetics of serial music have been a formative influence on his compositional thinking. Besides writing instrumental music, Karlheinz Essl also works in the field of electronic music, interactive realtime compositions and sound installations. Since the early 1990s, he has developed various software environments for realtime composition which he uses himself for his own live performances and also in collaboration with artists from other fields (choreographers, dancers, visual artists and poets).
In 1998, Essl started to develop a computer-based electronic instrument called m@ze°2 which he uses as an improviser in live performances. Since 2008, he is working on a series of compositions for various solo instruments and live electronics named Sequitur. Recently he has written several solo and ensemble pieces for electric guitar.

Projects
Since the 1990s, Karlheinz Essl carried out a number of projects for the Internet and became increasingly involved with improvisation. In 1997, Karlheinz Essl was featured at the Salzburg Festival with portrait concerts and sound installations. In 2003, he was artist-in-residence of the festival musik aktuell, and in 2004 he was presented with a series of portrait concerts at the Brucknerhaus Linz. 2008–2009 he was composer-in-residence of the Belgium ensemble Champ d'Action.

Keiko Matsui,"Keiko Matsui (松居 慶子, Matsui Keiko, born 26 July 1961, as Keiko Doi) is a Japanese keyboardist and composer, specializing in smooth jazz and New-age music.

Biography
Keiko Matsui was born in Tokyo, Japan. Her mother, Emiko, took her to her first piano lesson in the June following her sixth birthday. Japanese tradition holds that a child who is introduced to something at this time will continue in those studies for a long time. The tradition held true for Matsui, who studied piano throughout her school years. Though her early training focused on classical music, in junior high school she developed an interest in jazz and began composing her own music.
She studied children's culture at Japan Women's University (日本女子大学, nihon joshidaigaku), then studied at the Yamaha Music Foundation. She started the band Cosmos, which recorded four albums. She recorded her debut solo album, A Drop of Water (Passport, 1987), with her husband Kazu Matsui. She signed with MCA and released the albums No Borders and Under Northern Lights. In 1992 she signed with White Cat. Sapphire (1995) reached No. 1 on the Billboard magazine Contemporary Jazz chart.
She produced her album The Road (Shanachie, 2011) and recorded it with Richard Bona, Vinnie Colaiuta, Jackiem Joyner, and Kirk Whalum. She worked with Bob James on an album during the same year. Her album Soul Quest (2013) reached No. 6 on the jazz chart.

Sound
Matsui blends Western and Eastern music. She has a very spiritual view of composing music, feeling out each composition as though it were, in her words, ""coming to me from another space, another dimension,"" and ""catching notes from the silence and then simply placing them together"". Matsui sees music as ""the great gifts from the human souls from the past, for the children of the future"". She believes that music has a power to bring people together and change their lives. ""We are connected by music"", Matsui wrote, ""as the Ocean connects the continents"".
A lover of nature, Matsui often makes reference to plants, animals, the elements, and other natural features and phenomena in her song titles. She shows a special fascination with the moon as a number of her compositions refer to the moon in their titles.

Charity work
Her 1997 mini-CD A Gift of Hope went to support the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, and her music appeared in a Lifetime channel special about breast cancer. She performed at an ice skating event in 1997 to support the Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Proceeds from  A Gift of Life went to the National Marrow Donor Program and the Marrow Foundation to help Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, which promotes the registration of people of ethnic minorities as marrow donors to improve their chances of finding a matching donor. Royalties from her album Wildflower supported the United Nations World Food Programme. She performed at the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City on December 17, 2003, to benefit the program.

Kid A,"Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. It was recorded with their producer, Nigel Godrich, in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. 
After the stress of promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, the songwriter, Thom Yorke, wanted to depart from rock music. Drawing influence from electronic music, ambient music, krautrock, jazz and 20th-century classical music, Radiohead used instruments such as modular synthesisers, the ondes Martenot, brass and strings. They processed guitar sounds, incorporated samples and loops, and manipulated their recordings with software. Yorke wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random.
In a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they released short animations and became one of the first major acts to use the internet for promotion. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and Kid A was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos.
Kid A debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 in the US, where it sold more than 207,000 copies in its first week. Its new sound divided listeners, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure or derivative. However, at the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked it the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 Rolling Stone ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". Like OK Computer, Kid A won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the US and the UK.
A second album of material from the sessions, Amnesiac, was released eight months later. Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021.

Background
Following the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album OK Computer, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout. The songwriter, Thom Yorke, became ill, describing himself as ""a complete fucking mess ... completely unhinged"". He was troubled by new acts he felt were imitating Radiohead and became hostile to the music media. He told The Observer: ""I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that.""
Yorke suffered from writer's block and could not finish writing songs on guitar. He became disillusioned with the ""mythology"" of rock music, feeling the genre had ""run its course"". He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists signed to the record label Warp, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. Yorke said: ""It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music."" He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role, and wanted to focus on sounds and textures instead of traditional songwriting.
Yorke bought a house in Cornwall and spent his time walking the cliffs and drawing, restricting his musical activity to playing the grand piano he had recently bought. ""Everything in Its Right Place"" was the first song he wrote. His lack of knowledge of electronic instruments inspired him, as ""everything's a novelty ... I didn't understand how the fuck they worked. I had no idea what ADSR meant."" The guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise short, melodic guitar songs, but Yorke said: ""There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I'd completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment."" The bassist, Colin Greenwood, said: ""We felt we had to change everything. There were other guitar bands out there trying to do similar things. We had to move on.""

Recording
In the late 1990s, Radiohead began building their own studio in Oxfordshire. Yorke planned to use it as the German band Can had used their studio in Cologne, recording everything they played and then editing it. As the studio would not be complete until late 1999, Radiohead began work in Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris, in January 1999.
Radiohead worked with the OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Yorke's lack of lyrics created problems, as these had provided points of reference and inspiration for his bandmates in the past.
The group struggled with Yorke's new direction. According to Godrich, Yorke did not communicate much, and according to Yorke, Godrich ""didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else"". The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, feared ""awful art-rock nonsense just for its own sake"". His brother, Colin, did not enjoy Yorke's Warp influences, finding them ""really cold"". The other band members were unsure of how to contribute, and considered leaving. O'Brien said: ""It's scary – everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.""
Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin, and used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings. They found it difficult to use electronic instruments collaboratively. According to Yorke, ""We had to develop ways of going off into corners and build things on whatever sequencer, synthesiser or piece of machinery we would bring to the equation and then integrate that into the way we would normally work."" O'Brien began using sustain units on his guitar, which allow notes to be sustained infinitely, combined with looping and delay effects to create synthesiser-like sounds.
In March, Radiohead moved to Medley Studios in Copenhagen for two weeks, which were unproductive. The sessions produced about 50 reels of tape, each containing 15 minutes of music, with nothing finished. In April, Radiohead resumed recording in a mansion in Batsford Park, Gloucestershire. The lack of deadline and the number of incomplete ideas made it hard to focus, and the group held tense meetings. They agreed to disband if they could not agree on an album worth releasing. In July, O'Brien began keeping an online diary of Radiohead's progress. 
Radiohead moved to their new studio in Oxfordshire in September. In November, Radiohead held a live webcast from their studio, featuring a performance of new music and a DJ set. By 2000, six songs were complete. In January, at Godrich's suggestion, Radiohead split into two groups: one would generate a sound or sequence without acoustic instruments such as guitars or drums, and the other would develop it. Though the experiment produced no finished songs, it helped convince O'Brien of the potential of electronic instruments.
On 19 April 2000, Yorke wrote on Radiohead's website that they had finished recording. Having completed over 20 songs, Radiohead considered releasing a double album, but felt the material was too dense, and decided that a series of EPs would be a ""copout"". Instead, they saved half the songs for their next album, Amnesiac, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because ""they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places."" He observed that deciding the track list was not just a matter of choosing the best songs, as ""you can put all the best songs in the world on a record and they'll ruin each other"". He cited the later Beatles albums as examples of effective sequencing: ""How in the hell can you have three different versions of 'Revolution' on the same record and get away with it? I thought about that sort of thing."" Agreeing on the track list created arguments, and O'Brien said the band came close to breaking up: ""That felt like it could go either way, it could break ... But we came in the next day and it was resolved."" The album was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London.

Tracks
Radiohead worked on the first track, ""Everything in Its Right Place"", in a conventional band arrangement in Copenhagen and Paris, but without results. In Gloucestershire, Yorke and Godrich transferred the song to a Prophet-5 synthesiser, and Yorke's vocals were processed in Pro Tools using a scrubbing tool. O'Brien and the drummer, Philip Selway, said the track helped them accept that not every song needed every band member to play on it. O'Brien recalled: ""To be genuinely sort of delighted that you'd been working for six months on this record and something great has come out of it, and you haven't contributed to it, is a really liberating feeling."" Jonny Greenwood described it as a turning point for the album: ""We knew it had to be the first song, and everything just followed after it.""
Yorke wrote an early version of ""The National Anthem"" when the band was still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it as a B-side for OK Computer, but decided to keep it for their next album. For Kid A, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sounds sampled from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the ""organised chaos"" of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus, instructing the musicians to sound like a ""traffic jam"".
The strings on ""How to Disappear Completely"" were performed by the Orchestra of St John's and recorded in Dorchester Abbey, a 12th-century church about five miles from Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio. Radiohead chose the orchestra as they had performed pieces by Penderecki and Messiaen. Jonny Greenwood, the only Radiohead member trained in music theory, composed the string arrangement by multitracking his ondes Martenot. According to Godrich, when the orchestra members saw Greenwood's score ""they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn't do what he'd written, because it was impossible – or impossible for them, anyway"". The orchestra leader, John Lubbock, encouraged them to experiment and work with Greenwood's ideas. The concerts director, Alison Atkinson, said the session was more experimental than the orchestra's usual bookings.

""Idioteque"" was built from a drum machine pattern Greenwood created with a modular synthesiser. It incorporates a sample from the electronic composition ""Mild und Leise"" by Paul Lansky, taken from Electronic Music Winners, a 1976 album of experimental music. Greenwood gave 50 minutes of improvisation to Yorke, who took a short section of it and used it to write the song. Yorke said it was ""an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you're at the club and the PA's so loud, you know it's doing damage"".
""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" was written before Radiohead's debut single, ""Creep"" (1992), and Radiohead recorded a version on piano during the OK Computer sessions. For Kid A, Yorke recorded it on a pedal organ, influenced by the songwriter Tom Waits. Radiohead added harp samples and double bass, attempting to emulate the soundtracks of 1950s Disney films. Radiohead also worked on several songs they did not complete until future albums, including ""Nude"", ""Burn the Witch"" and ""True Love Waits"".

Music and lyrics
Style and influences
Kid A incorporates influences from electronic artists on Warp Records such as 1990s IDM artists Autechre and Aphex Twin; 1970s Krautrock bands such as Can; the jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis; and abstract hip hop from the Mo'Wax label, including Blackalicious and DJ Krush. Yorke cited Remain in Light (1980) by Talking Heads as a ""massive reference point"". Björk was another major influence, particularly her 1997 album Homogenic, as was the Beta Band. Radiohead attended an Underworld concert which helped renew their enthusiasm in a difficult moment.
The string orchestration for ""How to Disappear Completely"" was influenced by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Jonny Greenwood's use of the ondes Martenot on several songs was inspired by Olivier Messiaen, who popularised the instrument and was one of Greenwood's teenage heroes. Greenwood described his interest in mixing old and new music technology, and during the recording sessions Yorke read Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head, which chronicles the Beatles' recordings with George Martin during the 1960s. The band also sought to combine electronic manipulations with jam sessions in the studio, saying their model was the German band Can.
Kid A has been described as a work of electronica, experimental rock, post-rock, alternative rock, post-prog, ambient, electronic rock, art rock, and art pop. Though guitar is less prominent than on previous Radiohead albums, guitars were still used on most tracks. ""Treefingers"", an ambient instrumental, was created by digitally processing O'Brien's guitar loops. Many of Yorke's vocals were manipulated with effects; for example, his vocals on the title track were simply spoken, then vocoded with the ondes Martenot to create the melody.

Lyrics
Yorke's lyrics on Kid A are less personal than on earlier albums, and instead incorporate abstract and surreal themes. He cut up phrases and assembled them at random, combining cliches and banal observations; for example, ""Morning Bell"" features repeated contrasting lines such as ""Where'd you park the car?"" and ""Cut the kids in half"". Yorke denied that he was ""trying to get anything across"" with the lyrics, and described them as ""like shattered bits of mirror ... like pieces of something broken"". 
Yorke cited David Byrne's approach to lyrics on Remain in Light as an influence: ""When they made that record, they had no real songs, just wrote it all as they went along. Byrne turned up with pages and pages, and just picked stuff up and threw bits in all the time. And that's exactly how I approached Kid A."" Radiohead used Yorke's lyrics ""like pieces in a collage ... [creating] an artwork out of a lot of different little things"". The lyrics are not included in the liner notes, as Radiohead felt they could not be considered independently of the music, and Yorke did not want listeners to focus on them.
Yorke wrote ""Everything in Its Right Place"" about the depression he experienced on the OK Computer tour, feeling he could not speak. The refrain of ""How to Disappear Completely"" was inspired by R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: ""I'm not here, this isn't happening"". The refrain of ""Optimistic"" (""try the best you can / the best you can is good enough"") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when Yorke was frustrated with the band's progress. The title Kid A came from a filename on one of Yorke's sequencers. Yorke said he liked its ""non-meaning"", saying: ""If you call [an album] something specific, it drives the record in a certain way.""

Artwork
The Kid A artwork and packaging was created by Yorke with Stanley Donwood, who has worked with Radiohead since their 1994 EP My Iron Lung. Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop. While working on the artwork, Yorke and Donwood became ""obsessed"" with the Worldwatch Institute website, which was full of ""scary statistics about ice caps melting, and weather patterns changing""; this inspired them to use an image of a mountain range as the cover art. Donwood said he saw the mountains as ""some sort of cataclysmic power"".
Donwood was inspired by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War depicting a square metre of snow full of the ""detritus of war"", such as military equipment and cigarette stains. He said: ""I was upset by it in a way war had never upset me before. It felt like it was happening in my street."" The red swimming pool on the album spine and disc was inspired by the 1988 graphic novel Brought to Light by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, in which the number of people killed by state terrorism is measured in swimming pools filled with blood. Donwood said this image ""haunted"" him during the recording of the album, calling it ""a symbol of looming danger and shattered expectations"". Yorke and Donwood cited a Paris exhibition of paintings by David Hockney as another influence.
Yorke and Donwood made many versions of the album cover, with different pictures and different titles in different typefaces. Unable to pick one, they taped them to cupboards of the studio kitchen and went to bed. According to Donwood, the choice the next day ""was obvious"". In October 2021, Yorke and Donwood curated an exhibition of Kid A artwork at Christie's headquarters in London.

Promotion
Radiohead minimised their involvement in promotion for Kid A, conducting few interviews or photoshoots. Though ""Optimistic"" and promotional copies of other tracks received radio play, Radiohead released no singles from the album. Yorke said this was to avoid the stress of publicity, which he had struggled with on OK Computer, rather than for artistic reasons. He later said he regretted the decision, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics. 
Radiohead were careful to present Kid A as a cohesive work rather than a series of separate tracks. Rather than give EMI executives their own copies, they had them listen to the album in its entirety on a bus from Hollywood to Malibu. Rob Gordon, the vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, the American subsidiary of Radiohead's label EMI, praised the album but said promoting it would be a ""business challenge"". 
No advance copies of Kid A were circulated, but it was played under controlled conditions for critics and fans. On September 5, 2000, it was played for the public for the first time at the IMAX theatre in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Promotional copies of Kid A came with stickers prohibiting broadcast before September 19. At midnight, it was played in its entirety by the London radio station Xfm. MTV2, KROQ, and WXRK also played the album.
Rather than agree to a standard magazine photoshoot for Q, Radiohead supplied digitally altered portraits, with their skin smoothed, their irises recoloured, and Yorke's drooping eyelid removed. The Q editor Andrew Harrison described the images as ""aggressively weird to the point of taking the piss ... All five of Radiohead had been given the aspect of gawking aliens."" Yorke said: ""I'd like to see them try to put these pictures on a poster."" Q projected the images onto the Houses of Parliament, placed them on posters and billboards in the London Underground and on the Old Street Roundabout, and had them printed on key rings, mugs and mouse mats, to ""turn Radiohead back into a product"".

Videos
Instead of releasing traditional music videos for Kid A, Radiohead commissioned dozens of 10-second videos featuring Donwood artwork they called ""blips"", which were aired on music channels and distributed online. Pitchfork described them as ""context-free animated nightmares that radiated mystery"", with ""arch hints of surveillance"". Five of the videos were serviced as exclusives to MTV, and ""helped play into the arty mystique that endeared Radiohead to its core audience"", according to Billboard. Much of the promotional material featured pointy-toothed bear characters created by Donwood. The bears originated in stories Donwood made for his young children about teddy bears who came to life and ate the ""grown-ups"" who had abandoned them.

Internet
Though Radiohead had experimented with internet promotion for OK Computer in 1997, by 2000 online music promotion was not widespread, with record labels still reliant on MTV and radio. Donwood wrote that EMI was not interested in the Radiohead website, and left him and the band to update it with ""discursive and random content"".
To promote Kid A, Capitol created the ""iBlip"", a Java applet that could be embedded in fan sites. It allowed users to stream the album, and included artwork, photos and links to order Kid A on Amazon. It was used by more than 1000 sites, and the album was streamed more than 400,000 times. Capitol also streamed Kid A through Amazon, MTV.com and heavy.com, and ran a campaign with the peer-to-peer filesharing service Aimster, allowing users to swap iBlips and Radiohead-branded Aimster skins.
Three weeks before release, Kid A was leaked online and shared on the peer-to-peer service Napster. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, the Capitol president, Ray Lott, likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: ""I'm trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible. If I worried about what Napster would do, I wouldn't sell as many albums."" Yorke said Napster ""encourages enthusiasm for music in a way that the music industry has long forgotten to do"". 
The commercial success of Kid A suggested that leaks might not be as damaging as many had assumed. The music journalist Brent DiCrescenzo argued that the Napster leak profoundly affected the way Kid A was received, surprising listeners who would patiently download new tracks to find they comprised ""four minutes of ambient noise"".

Tour
Radiohead rearranged the Kid A songs to perform them live. O'Brien said, ""You couldn't do Kid A live and be true to the record. You would have to do it like an art installation ... When we played live, we put the human element back into it."" Selway said they ""found some new life"" in the songs when they came to perform them.
In mid-2000, months before Kid A was released, Radiohead toured the Mediterranean, performing Kid A and Amnesiac songs for the first time. Fans shared concert bootlegs online. Colin Greenwood said: ""We played in Barcelona and the next day the entire performance was up on Napster. Three weeks later when we got to play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful."" Later that year, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos, playing mostly new songs. The tour included a homecoming show in South Park, Oxford, with supporting performances by Humphrey Lyttelton (who performed on Amnesiac), Beck and Sigur Rós. According to the journalist Alex Ross, the show may have been the largest public gathering in Oxford history.
Radiohead also performed three concerts in North American theatres, their first in nearly three years. The small venues sold out rapidly, attracting celebrities, and fans camped overnight. In October, Radiohead performed on the American TV show Saturday Night Live. The performance shocked viewers expecting rock songs, with Jonny Greenwood playing electronic instruments, the house brass band improvising over ""The National Anthem"", and Yorke dancing erratically to ""Idioteque"". Rolling Stone described the Kid A tour as ""a revelation, exposing rock and roll humanity"" in the songs. In November 2001, Radiohead released I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, comprising performances from the Kid A and Amnesiac tours.

Sales
Kid A reached number one on Amazon's sales chart, with more than 10,000 pre-orders. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 55,000 copies in its first day – the biggest first-day sales of the year and more than every other album in the top ten combined. Kid A also debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling more than 207,000 copies in its first week. It was Radiohead's first US top-20 album, and the first US number one in three years for any British act. Kid A also debuted at number one in Canada, where it sold more than 44,000 copies in its first week, and in France, Ireland and New Zealand. European sales slowed on 2 October 2000, the day of release, when EMI recalled 150,000 faulty CDs. By June 2001, Kid A had sold 310,000 copies in the UK, less than a third of OK Computer sales. It is certified platinum in the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the US.

Critical reception
Kid A was widely anticipated. Spin described it as the most anticipated rock record since Nirvana's In Utero. According to Andrew Harrison, the editor of Q, journalists expected it to provide more of the ""rousing, cathartic, lots-of-guitar, Saturday-night-at-Glastonbury big future rock moments"" of OK Computer. Months before its release, Pat Blashill of Melody Maker wrote: ""If there's one band that promises to return rock to us, it's Radiohead.""
After Kid A had been played for critics, many bemoaned the lack of guitar, the obscured vocals and the unconventional song structures. Some called it ""a commercial suicide note"". The Guardian wrote of the ""muted electronic hums, pulses and tones"", predicting that it would confuse listeners. In Mojo, Jim Irvin wrote that ""upon first listen, Kid A is just awful ... Too often it sounds like the fragments that they began the writing process with – a loop, a riff, a mumbled line of text, have been set in concrete and had other, lesser ideas piled on top."" The Guardian critic Adam Sweeting wrote that ""even listeners raised on krautrock or Ornette Coleman will find Kid A a mystifying experience"", and that it pandered to ""the worst cliches"" about Radiohead's ""relentless miserabilism"". Several critics found the free jazz of ""The National Anthem"" discordant and unpleasant.
Several critics felt Kid A was pretentious or deliberately obscure. The Irish Times bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as ""deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about Kid A is the very real challenge to your attention span."" In the New Yorker, the novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was ""morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original"". The Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called it ""tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ... About 60 songs were started that no one had a bloody clue how to finish."" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as ""self-consciously awkward and bloody-minded, the noise made by a band trying so hard to make a 'difficult' album that they felt it beneath them to write any songs"". Rolling Stone published a piece mocking Kid A as humourless, derivative and lacking in songs: ""Because it was decided that Radiohead were Important and Significant last time around, no one can accept the album as the crackpot art project it so obviously is."" 
Some critics felt Kid A was unoriginal. In the New York Times, Howard Hampton dismissed Radiohead as a ""rock composite"" and wrote that Kid A ""recycles Pink Floyd's dark-side-of-the-moon solipsism to Me-Decade perfection"". Beaumont said Radiohead were ""simply ploughing furrows dug by DJ Shadow and Brian Eno before them"". The Irish Times felt the ambient elements were inferior to Eno's 1978 album Music For Airports and its ""scary"" elements inferior to Scott Walker's 1995 album Tilt. Select wrote: ""What do they want for sounding like the Aphex Twin circa 1993, a medal?"" In an NME editorial, James Oldham wrote that the electronic influences were ""mired in compromise"", with Radiohead still operating as a rock band, and concluded: ""Time will judge it. But right now, Kid A has the ring of a lengthy, over-analysed mistake."" Rob Mitchell, the co-founder of Warp, felt Kid A represented ""an honest interpretation of [Warp] influences"" and was not ""gratuitously"" electronic. He predicted it might one day be seen in the same way as David Bowie's 1977 album Low, which alienated some Bowie fans but was later acclaimed. In a retrospective, the Rolling Stone journalist Rob Sheffield wrote that the ""mastery of Warp-style electronic effects"" had appeared ""clumsy and dated"" at the time of Kid A's release.
AllMusic gave Kid A a favourable review, but wrote that it ""never is as visionary or stunning as OK Computer, nor does it really repay the intensive time it demands in order for it to sink in"". The NME was also positive, but described some songs as ""meandering"" and ""anticlimactic"", and concluded: ""For all its feats of brinkmanship, the patently magnificent construct called Kid A betrays a band playing one-handed just to prove they can, scared to commit itself emotionally."" In Rolling Stone, David Fricke called Kid A ""a work of deliberately inky, often irritating obsession ... But this is pop, a music of ornery, glistening guile and honest ache, and it will feel good under your skin once you let it get there.""
Spin said Kid A was ""not the act of career suicide or feat of self-indulgence it will be castigated as"", and predicted that fans would recognise it as Radiohead's best and ""bravest"" album. Billboard described it as ""an ocean of unparalleled musical depth"" and ""the first truly groundbreaking album of the 21st century"". The music critic Robert Christgau wrote that Kid A was ""an imaginative, imitative variation on a pop staple: sadness made pretty"". The Village Voice called it ""oblique oblique oblique ... Also incredibly beautiful."" Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork gave Kid A a perfect score, calling it ""cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike"". He concluded that Radiohead ""must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who"". One of the first Kid A reviews published online, it helped popularise Pitchfork and became notorious for its ""obtuse"" writing.
Radiohead denied that they had set out to create ""difficult"" music. Jonny Greenwood argued that the tracks were short and melodic, and suggested that ""people basically want their hands held through 12 'Mull Of Kintyre's"". Yorke said Radiohead had not attempted to alienate or confound, but that their musical interests had changed. He recalled that they had been ""white as a sheet"" before early performances on the Kid A tour, thinking they had been ""absolutely trashed"". At the same time, the reaction motivated them: ""There was a sense of a fight to convince people, which was actually really exciting."" Yorke said Radiohead felt ""incredibly vindicated and happy"" after Kid A reached number one in the US.
At Metacritic, which aggregates ratings from critics, Kid A has a score of 80 based on 24 reviews, indicating ""generally favourable reviews"". It was named one of the year's best albums by publications including the Wire, Record Collector, Spin, NME and the Village Voice. At the 2001 Grammy Awards, Kid A was nominated for Album of the Year and won for Best Alternative Album.

Legacy
In the years following its release, Kid A attracted acclaim. In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had ""challenged and confounded"" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently ""transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'."" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the ""defining moment in the Radiohead legend"". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved ""rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion"". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.
In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, ""Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever."" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is ""more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to"" and a ""far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer"". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: ""At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.""
Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: ""For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet – it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it."" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks.
Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: ""What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid."" In 2020, Billboard wrote that the success of the ""challenging"" Kid A established Radiohead as ""heavy hitters in the business for the long run"".

Accolades
In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Kid A number 20 on its updated ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list, describing it as ""a new, uniquely fearless kind of rock record for a new, increasingly fearful century ... [It] remains one of the more stunning sonic makeovers in music history."" In previous versions of the list, Kid A ranked at number 67 (2012) and number 428 (2003). In 2005, Stylus and Pitchfork named Kid A the best album of the previous five years, with Pitchfork calling it ""the perfect record for its time: ominous, surreal, and impossibly millennial"".
In 2006, Time named Kid A one of the 100 best albums, calling it ""the opposite of easy listening, and the weirdest album to ever sell a million copies, but ... also a testament to just how complicated pop music can be"". At the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s. The Guardian ranked it second best, calling it ""a jittery premonition of the troubled, disconnected, overloaded decade to come. The sound of today, in other words, a decade early."" In 2021, Pitchfork readers voted Kid A the greatest album of the previous 25 years. In 2011, Rolling Stone named ""Everything in Its Right Place"" the 24th-best song of the 2000s, describing it as ""oddness at its most hummable"". ""Idioteque"" was named one of the best songs of the decade by Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, and Rolling Stone ranked it #33 on its 2018 list of the ""greatest songs of the century so far"".

Reissues
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. After a period of being out of print on vinyl, Kid A was reissued as a double LP on 19 August 2008 as part of the ""From the Capitol Vaults"" series, along with other Radiohead albums. In 2007, EMI released Radiohead Box Set, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including Kid A. On 25 August 2009, EMI reissued Kid A in a two-CD ""Collector's Edition"" and a ""Special Collector's Edition"" containing an additional DVD. Both versions feature live tracks, taken mostly from television performances. Radiohead had no input into the reissues and the music was not remastered. 
The EMI reissues were discontinued after Radiohead's back catalogue transferred to XL Recordings in 2016. In May 2016, XL reissued Kid A on vinyl, along with the rest of Radiohead's back catalogue. An early demo of ""The National Anthem"" was included in the special edition of the 2017 OK Computer reissue OKNOTOK 1997 2017. In February 2020, Radiohead released an extended version of ""Treefingers"", previously released on the soundtrack for the 2000 film Memento, to digital platforms.
On November 5, 2021, Radiohead released Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A and Amnesiac. It includes a third album, Kid Amnesiae, comprising previously unreleased material from the sessions. Radiohead promoted the reissue with singles for the previously unreleased tracks ""If You Say the Word"" and ""Follow Me Around"". Kid A Mnesia Exhibition, an interactive experience with music and artwork from the albums, was released on November 18 for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.

King Never,"King Never is a rock band influenced by ambient, new wave, and progressive rock, based in Loomis, California.  Founded by Matt McCabe (vocals, guitar) in 1995, the band has undergone different formations and member changes throughout its history.

History
Founded in 1995, and influenced by 80s new wave and progressive rock such as The Police, King Crimson, and The Fixx, King Never originally began as an outlet for Matt McCabe's explorations on guitar with real-time looping techniques.
King Never's debut album Ambient Guitar Noise: Volume 1, featuring 10 tracks, was recorded live in studio by McCabe over the course of a week and released by Marathon Records in 2000.
2004's Marathon Records release of Orphans, Misfits & Fragments, a full length 11 track album, incorporated more collaborators into the mix with McCabe and the additional talents of Greg Asher, Jeff Elbel, and Kristy McCabe.
Lullabies & Sleepless Nights (Ambient Guitar Noise: Volume 2), was a return to form, featuring 10 tracks, again wholly recorded by McCabe live in studio with no overdubbing, released by Marathon Records in 2007.
From March 2009 into December 2010, McCabe hosted the King Never Podcast in which he discussed recording what became the album Possibilities.
In May 2010, the concept album Possibilities was released, which chronicles the fictional character ""Sonja"" through a steampunk inspired world on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening. The character was inspired by aspects of Fydor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This album included contributors Jake Wood (drums), and Kristy McCabe (vocals), with cover art by Nemo. This was the first independent release by the band. In April 2012 music videos for The City and Gravity, both directed by Gerald Benesch were released via the King Never official YouTube channel.
A single, We Three Kings was released in November 2010. This track included Jordan Reading on bass, Evan Parandes on drums, and Kristy McCabe once again providing backing vocals. Cover artwork by Sue McCabe. Jeff Elbel is credited with special thanks for lending a critical ear.
King Never had slowly morphed over time into a ""full band"" studio project with many guest collaborators including Able Cain alumni Greg Asher and Jordan Reading, Jeff Elbel (Ping, Farewell To Juliet), Jake Wood (Super Adventure Club), Evan Parandes, and Kristy McCabe.
In May 2012, King Never developed a consistent line-up. At the cajoling of McCabe's co-worker to audition his brother, McCabe met bassist Karl Lane. After a handful of auditions, Drummer Scott Gontjes was soon added to the lineup. The trio began playing gigs in the Sacramento area and over time throughout the Bay area and Northern California.
In the spring of 2013, the band would release the EP 37, consisting of 5 tracks. In July 2014, an official lyric music video for the track Mr. No was released on the band's official YouTube channel.
Shortly after releasing the EP 37, drummer Gontjes unexpectedly chose to exit the band to pursue other projects.  McCabe and Lane auditioned other drummers, but it was the suggestion of another co-worker that his brother-in-law played drums, that led the duo to Nick Baranski. Baranski became King Never's new drummer.
Sadly, after a short battle with cancer, on August 11, 2014, bassist Karl Lane died. Lane's bass playing appears on 37 and All These Things.
In November 2015, McCabe's long time friend, Jordan Reading, was recruited to play bass with the band.
The 3 track concept EP All These Things, a reflection on World War I, was released on Memorial Day May 29, 2017. The EP features the McCabe, Lane, and Baranski lineup, with cover art by Rick Law.
In March 2020, the band released their single Stick In The Mud with the now familiar line-up of McCabe, Reading, and Baranski. 
The single includes the lyric of the nursery rhyme Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me.
The band's name King Never derives from a passage of Fydor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. A returning theme for the band is Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In an early 2000 Popup interview with clubknowledge.com McCabe cited being inspired by the works. Those themes were also inspirational in the band's 2010 release Possibilities.

Reviews
In a 2005 review of Orphans, Misfits & Fragments, Brian Baker of Amplifier Magazine wrote: 

King Never has been around in various forms for nearly a decade. The band was launched by guitarist Matt McCabe in the mid'90s as an experiment in realtime looping and ambient/rock genre blending. Orphans, Misfits & Fragments is only King Never's second full album in its ten year history, and it's clear from the finished product that McCabe has spent a great deal of time painstakingly assembling the album's evocative and entrancing content. McCabe's ambient looping creates a cerebral texture that serves as a soft foundation for his more traditional rock song structures and visceral and sinewy guitar flights. The result is an atmospheric blend of Brian Eno's dreamy meanderings and the prog/pop guitar tension of King Crimson's Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew.

Lullabies and Sleeplesss Nights (Ambient Guitar Noise: Volume 2) was released January 1, 2007. AmbientMusicGuide.com said about the release: ""I don't know whether ""purist"" is the word but Californian ambient guitarist King Never takes pride in choosing the riskier path of recording his tracks live, with no further editing or overdubs. With his electric guitar, effects and loop machines he creates a seductive and surprisingly broad palate of nocturnal sounds on Lullabies And Sleepless Nights. It's beatless and mostly gentle, shifting between tonal and slightly dissonant. There's the odd burst of jagged distortion just in case, I presume, you've nodded off too early. This is often impressive and eerily beautiful stuff and not just for guitar fans by any means. Rating 3.5/5.""
Of the album Possibilities released May 17, 2010 Downthelinezine.com said: ""If you like music in that arena of alternative rock, you will also like this album.""
In a review of 37 for Prognaut.com, Joseph Shingler ""Recommended for fans of 80s' alternative rock."" and noted: ""The music is influenced by bands like Police, The Fixx, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, and 'Radiohead; and even some of the later period albums from the band Spirit can be detected in tracks like “Push And Pull” and “Mr. No”.
For the most part the accessible compositions are sedate melancholy ballads; a bit on the short side, but with an infectious hook. Solid songwriting.""
Jeff Elbel wrote of 37: ""Fans of crafty electric guitar and bands like Porcupine Tree, Belew-era King Crimson and The Police will want to check out this King Never EP. It's a straight-shooting representation of what this tightly-knit trio can do on stage. Until I get the chance to see it happen in Chicago, I'll be spinning 37. I’ve been a fan of Matt McCabe's playing and songwriting an embarrassingly long amount of time, but for good reason. This set finds him making yet another forward push against the boundaries.""
About All These Things Matt Crosslin of Downthelinezine.com wrote: ""I can hear everything from early U2 to emo in each song, all blended cleverly into a coherent whole. The only problem with this is the length: only three songs leaves you wanting more. But the three songs you get pack quite a punch.""

Kit Watkins,"Kit Watkins (born 1953) is an American progressive-ambient-jazz recording artist based in Brattleboro, Vermont. He was previously a member of the band Happy the Man.

Beginnings
Born in Virginia to classical piano teachers, Watkins took piano lessons from the age of 5 to 13. As a teenager he began to play keyboards in various amateur bands, first playing Top 40 material, then moving to progressive rock covers by bands such as Yes and ELP. While a student at James Madison University, he met guitarist Stanley Whitaker, who introduced him to Gentle Giant, Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator. He joined Whitaker's fledgling band Happy the Man in 1973.

Happy The Man (1973-79)
The band moved to the Washington, DC area in the summer of 1975 and developed a devoted following as a result of airplay on WGTB-FM (the Georgetown University radio station which no longer broadcasts) as well as live performances sponsored by the station, headlining the Pandemedia event of that year. The band was a regular act at The Cellar Door in Georgetown, DC, and signed to the venue's management office. In 1976, they signed with Clive Davis' Arista Records, which released two albums, Happy The Man (1977) and Crafty Hands (1978). Both albums were produced by Ken Scott, engineer from The Beatles' White Album sessions, who also engineered and produced albums by David Bowie, Supertramp, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and the Dixie Dregs. Watkins worked closely with Scott as the band's representative in recording and mixing both Happy The Man albums. But before Crafty Hands was finished being recorded, Davis had a change of heart and dropped the band from his label.
In 1979, HTM performed locally to an ever growing audience. They struggled to find another label to pick them up. In the Spring of 1979, HTM disbanded only months after having recorded a demo tape of their 3rd album.
In 1983, Kit released the band's demo and called it, 3rd, Better late.. on his Azimuth Record Label.

Performances
Kit and Brad Allen performed only one show in support of Frames Of Mind, at a club called DC Space, on Jan 21 1982. During which concert, Brad broke a guitar string and took time out to repair it. During this break, someone called out a request, ""Play Untitled!"" Untitled, was an outtake from the Labyrinth album and was often performed live at Kit and Coco shows. Kit honored the request. Untitled was later released on Kit's Holographic Tapestries CD.

Camel and early solo years
In June 1979, Watkins traveled to England to join Camel, and the band recorded a new album, I Can See Your House From Here for Decca Records, with Rupert Hine as producer.
During 1980, Watkins launched a solo career and recorded his first solo album, Labyrinth, (with Coco Roussel on drums) on Kit's own indie Label Azimuth. In a review of the album, critic George Varga described Watkins as ""a composer and synthesizer wizard of almost unequaled talents."" The LP was largely in the same vein as Happy The Man, including a couple of compositions written for Happy The Man's third album. ""Kit & Coco"" played duo concerts sparsely in the fall and winter of 1980 and 1981 - in between Kit's tours with Camel. The duo performed with backing tape accompaniment, often ending their set with an unaccompanied improvisation. A historic video tape of Kit & Coco's December 1, 1981 performance at DC's 9:30 Club was made but has never been released.
Watkins' next effort, Frames of Mind, with Brad Allen on guitars and vocals, appeared in 1982. The album was a fun and quirky mix of new wave pop and hybrid world music, recorded at Watkins' home studio in Arlington, Virginia and released on his label, Azimuth Records.
In 1983, Kit released Happy The Man's 3rd LP, ""Better late.."" on his Azimuth Record Label.

Later solo years
In 1987, Watkins relocated to Linden, Virginia in the rural Blue Ridge Mountains where he recorded and released several albums over the next 10 years, including Azure (1988), SunStruck (1990), and wet, dark, and low (1992) for the Minneapolis-based East Side Digital (ESD) label, and Thought Tones (1990), A Different View (1991), Kinetic Vapors (1993), Holographic Tapestries (1995), and Beauty Drifting (1996) for his Linden Music label. Linden also released a number of albums by other notable electronic/ambient artists, including David Borden, Robert Rich, and Jeff Greinke.
Linden Music closed its doors in 1997 due to distribution problems, but Watkins has continued releasing his work on CD, first via MP3.com and currently via Cafepress. In 2000, he signed a contract with One Way Records for the release of four of his albums (Labyrinth, SunStruck, wet, dark, and low, and Holographic Tapestries) which continue to be distributed nationally.
Recent albums include The Unseen (2000), Rolling Curve (2000), The Gathering (2001 - a live recording of a rare live performance given in Philadelphia that year), music for the end (2001), This Time and Space (2003), unraveled (2003), Flying Petals (2004), and World Fiction (2005). Critic Ernie Rideout, in reviewing Flying Petals, wrote that it ""is as intriguing for the depth of compositional talent as it is for beautiful sound design and monster grooves.""
Watkins has released two DVDs: a hypnotic visual work based on his album This Time and Space (2004); and The Gathering (2005), a live performance, videotaped by his longtime friend and Azimuth Records partner Sally Heldrich.
In 2008, Watkins began an association with the Earth Mantra ambient netlabel which has released many of his albums for free under a Creative Commons license.

Kitarō,"Kitarō (喜多郎), born Masanori Takahashi (高橋 正則) (February 4, 1953), is a Japanese recording artist, composer, record producer, and arranger noted for his electronic-instrumental music, and is often associated with and regarded as one of the most prominent musical acts of new-age music. He won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album for Thinking of You (1999), with a record 16 nominations in the same category. He received a Golden Globe Award for the original score to Heaven & Earth (1993).

Early life: 1954–76
Masanori Takahashi was born in Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan, and is a graduate of Sahid University.  Kitarō, which is his boyhood name meaning ""man of love and joy"", a practicing Buddhist himself, was born in a family of Shinto-Buddhist farmers.  After graduating his parents were first opposed to the idea of their son having a musical career.  In an effort to maneuver him towards their vision, they made arrangements for him to take a job at a local company. In response, he silently did not show up for the job, eventually convincing them that he should work on something he loved.
In high school Kitarō played electric guitar in a band that played American rhythm and blues of Otis Redding and covers by The Beatles. After graduating, and learning to play drums and bass, Kitaro moved to Tokyo to experience and become a part of the music scene, and it was there that he discovered the synthesizer.  His first synthesizer was analog, and he recalls having ""just loved the analog sound that it made compared to today's digital sound"".
In the early 1970s, he changed completely to keyboard and joined the Japanese progressive rock band Far East Family Band and recorded four albums with them.  While in Japan and Europe in 1975, he met the German electronica and former Tangerine Dream member Klaus Schulze.  Schulze produced two albums for the band and gave Kitaro some tips for controlling synthesizers. In 1976, Kitaro left Far East Family Band and travelled through Asia (China, Laos, Thailand, India).

Solo career: 1977–present
Back in Japan, Kitaro started his solo career in 1977.  The first two albums Ten Kai and Daichi were released in 1978 and 1979.  He performed his first symphonic concert at the ""Small Hall"" of the Kosei Nenkin Kaikan in Shinjuku, Tokyo.

Silk Road
The Silk Road: The Rise And Fall Of Civilizations is an NHK Tokushu documentary series that first aired on 7 April 1980, with sequels being broadcast over a 10-year period.  It took a total of 17 years from conception to complete what many consider a landmark in Japan's broadcasting television history.  The intention of the program was to reveal how ancient Japan was influenced by the Silk Road trade route.  The documentary was narrated by Ishizaka Koji with music composed by Kitaro, who insisted that the show be broadcast in stereo.  The music was composed mainly using a Minimoog, miniKORG 700, and Maxikorg DV800.  The score received a Galaxy Award, and the series of soundtracks sold millions of copies.  The success created from the program brought Kitaro international attention.

1984–1993
In 1984, Kitaro embarked on a ""Live in Asia"" tour. Notably, he was forced to cancel a leg in Singapore because he had long hair and at that time the country had a policy banning it.
He entered into a worldwide distribution arrangement with Geffen Records in 1985–1986. This included a re-releasing of six prior albums entitled Ten Kai (aka Astral Voyage), Daichi (aka Full Moon Story), Millennia, India, Silver Cloud and Live in Asia (aka Asia) (each packaged with Japanesque obi strips) as well as a new album, aptly titled Toward the West. Due to his combination of electronic and acoustic sounds, mellow music, and repeating chords which resembled the umbrella New age music category in the United States and Europe, his music was labeled as ""new age"". While he is not comfortable with the term, it doesn't mean much to him: ""Whether people say my music is new age or not, it's OK with me. I'm just going to keep calling it Kitaro's music"". On his music he noted that his outlook on life, study of philosophy, and responsibility to create music which has a good influence on society, influence his musical creation.
In 1987, he collaborated with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead for the album The Light of the Spirit (which sold two million copies) and in 1992 with Jon Anderson (Yes) for the album Dream. In 1988, his record sales soared to 10 million worldwide following a successful US tour. He was nominated three times for Grammy Award for Best New Age Album during his tenure at Geffen Records. In 1990 the studio album Kojiki was released, inspired by the Japanese 8th century chronicle Kojiki; the album reached #159 on Billboard 200, and #1 on Billboard New Age chart. His soundtrack for the movie Heaven & Earth (1993) won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Kitaro also produced an album Scenes (1992) released by Shrapnel Records with former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman.

1994–present
Domo Records
Since his 1994 debut for Domo Records, and the Grammy-nominated Mandala, Kitaro has released 24 studio albums. Among them, the live An Enchanted Evening (1995), Gaia-Onbashira (1998), and Ancient (2001) were all Grammy nominated. In 1999, Thinking of You won the Grammy for Best New Age Album. Kitaro and Randy Miller's soundtrack album The Soong Sisters (2000) received Best Original Music Award from the Hong Kong Film Award (1998), as well as the Taiwan Golden Horse Film Festival and Award (1997).

Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai series
Kitaro’s music has long been recognized for its messages of peace and spirituality. In the wake of 9/11 the artist began to record the conceptual endeavor, which he envisioned as an artistic means to help unify people globally, Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai (2003). This was a series of peace-themed albums inspired by the Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage - the travel of Kūkai more than 1100 years ago. The four volumes in the album series were released in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively. Every track on the 4 volumes of Sacred Journey Of Ku-Kai contains samples from ancient Japanese temple bells (Peace Bells) from 88 sacred temples on the island of Shikoku, Japan.

Impressions of the West Lake
In 2007, Kitaro composed the music for Impression West Lake, a large-scale opera, directed by the renowned Chinese film director Zhang Yimou. The opera reflects Hangzhou city’s history and culture through music and dance. Using modern technology, the stage is 75 centimeters below the lake’s surface during the day so as not to affect the landscape and boating activities. In the evening, the stage is a few centimeters below the lake’s surface so actors can walk and perform freely over a surprising water mirror that compose with the lights and colors. The one-hour event had its opening night in March 2007. In 2009, Domo Records released the original soundtrack album Impressions of the West Lake which was nominated for the Grammy in Best New Age Album category.

Recent projects
Kitaro's latest studio album is Final Call, which is a homage to Kitaro's lifetime reverence for nature and was released in September 2013. A year later, in September 2014, his latest live album Symphony Live in Istanbul was released. It was recorded live at the Halic Congress Center in Istanbul, Turkey during Kitaro's Symphonic World Tour, balancing the artist's trademark signature sound and expanding it to new heights with the addition of a 38-piece chamber symphony orchestra. Both Final Call and Symphony Live in Istanbul were nominated for Best New Age Album, becoming Kitaro's 15th and 16th career Grammy Award nominations. More recently he has reissued his critically acclaimed studio albums Kojiki in 2015 and Tenku in 2016.

Touring and other activities
In 2007 to 2009, he launched the ""Love and Peace World Tour,"" an international tour with which Kitaro hoped to inspire his message of world peace with his music. Kitaro toured Southeast Asia in 2007, Greece in 2008 and Hong Kong, Japan, Southeast Asia in 2009. During his visit to Greece, Kitaro met Greek composer Vangelis, and exchanged musical experience and creative ideas.
In 2010, Kitaro performed in Singapore in March, in Mexico for the Zacatecas Cultural Festival in April, in Xi'an, China for the opening event of Daming Palace National Heritage Park in September, in Aichi, Japan, for the Thousand Drums Event at COP10 for the Convention on Biological Diversity in October. From March to April, 2011, Kitaro was on tour titled The Silk Road – East & West, visiting Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. He donated part of the CD sales and concert profits to Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami Relief. For the same purpose he participated in the 2011 edition of Musicians United for Safe Energy. In 2012 he released Let Mother Earth Speak, a collaboration album with Native American activist Dennis Banks.

Personal life
From around 1983 to 1990, Kitarō was married to Yuki Taoka, daughter of Kazuo Taoka. They have a son. In the early 1990s, he moved from Japan to the United States. In the mid-1990s, he married Keiko Matsubara, a musician who played on several of his albums. Along with Keiko's son, the couple lived in Ward, Colorado, on a 180-acre (72.85 hectare) spread and composed in his 2500-square-foot (230 m²) home studio ""Mochi House"" (it is large enough to hold a 70-piece orchestra). Around 2005, they relocated to Sebastopol, California. Kitaro subsequently divorced Keiko (you can see her absence from the performances during 2020-2021 period). On 24 February 2022, he married Brazil-born, ethnically Japanese artist Franci Shimomaebara in a private ceremony attended by friends and relatives. They had met in 1990, and after becoming friends worked together on The Wind, which was featured on Kitarō's Grammy-nominated 2003 album, Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai, Volume 1. In 2012 they collaborated on the album Symphony of my Dreams where Franci recorded vocal renditions of some of Kitarō’s famous pieces, including Silk Road.

Klaus Schulze,"Klaus Schulze (4 August 1947 – 26 April 2022) was a German electronic music pioneer, composer and musician. He also used the alias Richard Wahnfried and was a member of the Krautrock bands Tangerine Dream, Ash Ra Tempel, and the Cosmic Jokers before launching a solo career consisting of more than 60 albums released across six decades.

Early life
Schulze was born in Berlin in 1947. His father was a writer and his mother a ballet dancer. After graduating from high school, he delivered telegrams and studied German at the Technical University of Berlin. He and his wife Elfie had two sons, Maximilian and Richard.

Career
1970s
In 1969, Schulze was the drummer of one of the early incarnations of Tangerine Dream – one of the most famous bands that got the nickname ""Krautrock"" in English speaking countries (others included Kraftwerk and Popol Vuh) – for their debut album Electronic Meditation. Before 1969 he was a drummer in a band called Psy Free. He met Edgar Froese from Tangerine Dream in the Zodiac Club in what was then West Berlin. In 1970 he left this group to form Ash Ra Tempel with Manuel Göttsching and Hartmut Enke.  In 1971, he chose again to leave a newly formed group after only one album, this time to mount a solo career. In 1972, Schulze released his debut album Irrlicht with organ and a recording of an orchestra filtered almost beyond recognition.  Despite the lack of synthesizers, this proto-ambient work is regarded as a milestone in electronic music.  His follow-up album, Cyborg, was similar but added the EMS VCS 3 synthesizer.
Since this point, Schulze's career was the most prolific, such that he could claim more than 40 original albums to his name since Irrlicht. Highlights of these include 1975's Timewind, 1976's Moondawn (his first album to feature the Moog synthesizer), 1979's Dune, and 1995's double-album In Blue (which featured one long track called ""Return to the Tempel"" with electric guitar contributions from his friend Manuel Göttsching of Ash Ra Tempel). In 1976, he was drafted by Japanese percussionist and composer Stomu Yamashta to join his short-lived ""supergroup"" Go, also featuring Steve Winwood, Michael Shrieve, and Al Di Meola. They released two studio albums (Go in 1976 and Go Too in 1977) and one live album (Go Live from Paris, 1976).
Throughout the 1970s he followed closely in the footsteps of Tangerine Dream, albeit with far lighter sequencer lines and a more reflective, dreamy sheen, not unlike the ambient music of his contemporary Brian Eno. On occasions he would also compose film scores, including horror and thriller movies such as Barracuda (1977) and Next of Kin (1982). Some of his lighter albums are appreciated by new-age music fans, despite the fact that Schulze has always denied connections to this genre. By mid-decade, with the release of Timewind and Moondawn, his style transformed from Krautrock to Berlin School.
Schulze had a more organic sound than other electronic artists of the time. Often he would throw in decidedly non-electronic sounds, such as acoustic guitar and a male operatic voice in Blackdance, or a cello in Dune (1979) and Trancefer. Schulze developed a Minimoog patch that sounds uncannily like an electric guitar. Schulze often takes German events as a starting point for his compositions, a notable example being on his 1978 album ""X"" (the title signifying it was his tenth album), subtitled ""Six Musical Biographies"", a reference to such notables as Ludwig II of Bavaria, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georg Trakl, and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. His use of the pseudonym Richard Wahnfried is indicative of his interest in Richard Wagner, a clear influence on some albums like the aforementioned Timewind.
Schulze built a record studio in Hambühren, Germany.

1980s
In the 1980s Schulze started using digital instruments besides the usual analog synthesizers, and his work accordingly became less experimental and more accessible. Although the switch to using digital equipment is audible in the style of Dig It (1980), it was not until the release of Trancefer (1981) that the shift in style became evident.
This newer style can also be found in Schulze's next release Audentity. Both ""Cellistica"" and ""Spielglocken"" are composed in a similar sequencer-based style as on Trancefer, but this is certainly not the case of all of Audentity's tracks; indeed, ""Sebastian im Traum"" hints towards the operatic style to be found in some of Schulze's much later works. The predominance of sequencing can also be found in the follow-up live album Dziękuję Poland Live '83, although many of its tracks are re-workings of those to be found on Audentity. Schulze's next studio-based album was Angst (soundtrack to the namesake 1983 film). The cold yet haunting electronic rhythms generate an alienated atmosphere. Typical are the Fairlight synth and Linn electronic drums sounds.
Another highlight of this era was En=Trance with the dreamy cut ""FM Delight"". The album Miditerranean Pads marked the beginning of very complex percussion arrangements that continued through the next two decades.
In 1989, German band Alphaville released their album The Breathtaking Blue, on which Klaus Schulze was both a contributing musician and the album's producer.

1990s
Starting with Beyond Recall, the first half of the 1990s was his ""sample"" period, when Schulze used a wide variety of prerecorded sounds such as screeching birds and sensuous female moans in his studio albums and live performances. Sampling heavily died down with his 1995 album In Blue. The decade also saw the release of copious amounts of previously unreleased material, of varying quality, in several limited-edition boxed sets.

2000s
In 2005 he began re-releasing his classic solo and Wahnfried albums with bonus tracks of unreleased material recorded at roughly the same time as the original works. In the latter part of the decade, Schulze produced albums and staged numerous live appearances with Lisa Gerrard.

2010s
Big in Japan: Live in Tokyo 2010 was Schulze's fortieth album, and its release in September 2010 marked the beginning of his fifth decade as a solo musician.  The Japan concerts were to be his last live performances. 
His next album, Shadowlands, was released in February 2013, quickly to be followed by the release of The Schulze–Schickert Session 1975, a rare long-unreleased collaboration, in March 2013.  After a hiatus of several years, he returned to the studio in 2018 for another album, Silhouettes.  Much of the album was recorded in a single take.

2020s
Schulze died on 26 April 2022 following a long illness.  His final album, Deus Arrakis, was released on 1 July 2022.

Richard Wahnfried
Richard Wahnfried, then simply Wahnfried after 1993, is the longtime and only real alias for Klaus Schulze – originally a pseudonym, later an official side project name. Seven albums were released under this name between 1979 and 1997.
The main characteristics of the Wahnfried albums (as opposed to Schulze's regular works) are:

Often being oriented towards more mainstream genres (some would say ""more commercial""), such as rock, dance, techno, and trance.
Always allowing for collaborative and less electronic albums, with known or unknown guest musicians performing along with Schulze's synths.
The pseudonym's etymology stems from Schulze's love for Richard Wagner:

Richard, evidently from Wagner's first name. Richard is also the name of Schulze's first son.
Wahnfried (""Peace from delusion and/or madness"", in German), from the name Wagner gave to his villa in Bayreuth (and where he was later buried).
In his 1975 album Timewind (four years before the first alias use), Schulze had already named a track ""Wahnfried 1883"" (in reference to Wagner's death and burial in his Wahnfried's garden in 1883). The other track on Timewind is called ""Bayreuth Return"". After 1993, the albums are simply credited to ""Wahnfried"", and namedrop Schulze (""featuring Klaus Schulze"", ""Produced by Klaus Schulze"").
""Wahnfried"" is the only known alias of Schulze (albeit on the 1998 Tribute to Klaus Schulze album, among 10 other artists, Schulze contributed one track barely hidden behind the ""Schulzendorfer Groove Orchester"" pseudonym).

Discography
Albums
Schulze's concert performances are original compositions recorded live and thus listed as albums. An intensive reissue program of Schulze CDs began in 2005, with most releases having bonus tracks, and sometimes additional discs. They are published by the label Revisited Records (a division of German company InsideOut Music), and distributed by SPV.

Kraftwerk,"Kraftwerk (German: [ˈkʁaftvɛɐ̯k], lit. ""power plant"") are a German electronic band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Wolfgang Flür joined the band in 1973 and Karl Bartos in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet. Since the band's formation, it has seen numerous lineup changes, with Hütter as its only constant member.
On commercially successful albums such as Autobahn (1974), Trans-Europe Express (1977), The Man-Machine (1978), and Computer World (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described ""robot pop"" style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of Electric Café (1986), Flür left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. The band released Tour de France Soundtracks, their latest album of new material, in 2003. Founding member Schneider left in 2008. The band, with new members, has continued to tour under the leadership of Hütter.
The band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including synth-pop, hip hop, post-punk, techno, house music, ambient, and club music. In 2014, the Recording Academy honoured Kraftwerk with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They later won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album with their live album 3-D The Catalogue (2017) at the 2018 ceremony. In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in the early influence category. As of 2024, the band continues to tour, with the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary.

History
Formation and early years (1970–1973)
Florian Schneider (flutes, synthesizers, violin) and Ralf Hütter (organ, synthesizers) met as students at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf in the late 1960s, participating in the German experimental music and art scene of the time, which Melody Maker jokingly dubbed ""krautrock"".
They joined a quintet known as Organisation, which released one album, Tone Float in 1970, issued on RCA Records in the UK, and split shortly thereafter. Schneider became interested in synthesizers,  deciding to acquire one in 1970. While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists Gilbert and George, they see ""two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, Hütter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk"".
Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, including guitarist Michael Rother and drummer Klaus Dinger, who left to form Neu!. The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. Hütter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).
The band released two free-form experimental rock albums, Kraftwerk (1970) and Kraftwerk 2 (1972). The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were mostly made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. Occasionally, they performed with bass players as well. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. Later in 1973, Wolfgang Flür joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show Aspekte for German television network ZDF.
With Ralf und Florian, released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder in the song ""Ananas Symphonie"" (Pineapple Symphony,) which became one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist Simon Reynolds, Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the ""adrenalized insurgency"" of Detroit artists of the late '60s MC5 and the Stooges.
The input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer Konrad ""Conny"" Plank was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of Can, Neu!, Cluster, and Harmonia. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near Cologne became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums.

International breakthrough: Autobahn and Radioactivity (1974–1976)
The release of Autobahn in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. Hütter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the Minimoog and the EMS Synthi AKS, helping give Kraftwerk a newer, ""disciplined"" sound. Autobahn was also the last album that Conny Plank engineered. After the commercial success of Autobahn in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes, Hütter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist Emil Schult became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.
The year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With financial support from Phonogram Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a tour to promote the Autobahn album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The two men started singing live for the first time, and Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.
After the 1975 Autobahn tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, Radio-Activity (German title: Radio-Aktivität). After further investment in new equipment, the Kling Klang Studio became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though Radio-Activity was less commercially successful than Autobahn in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a gold disc in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of Autobahn and Radio-Activity, Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.
In 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the Radio-Activity album. David Bowie was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his Station to Station tour, an offer the group declined. Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the Radio-Activity tour of 1976.
Also, in this tour, they played some ""demo-test"" versions for Trans Europe Express songs (Showroom Dummies, Trans Europe Express and Europe Endless) as you could hear on some YouTube videos with show bootlegs.

Trans-Europe Express, The Man-Machine and Computer World (1977–1982)
After having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording Trans-Europe Express (German: Trans-Europa Express) at the Kling Klang Studio. Trans-Europe Express was mixed at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. It was around this time that Hütter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview (Brian Eno) with Hütter, but it never materialised. The release of Trans-Europe Express  in March 1977 was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France.  The album won a disco award in New York later that year.
In May 1978 Kraftwerk released The Man-Machine (German: Die Mensch-Maschine), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in Düsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. The Man-Machine was the first Kraftwerk album where Karl Bartos was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist El Lissitzky and the Suprematism movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not release another album for three years.
In May 1981 Kraftwerk released Computer World (German: Computerwelt) on EMI Records. It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981. Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour. Some of the electronic vocals on Computer World were generated using a Texas Instruments language translator. ""Computer Love"" was released as a single backed with the Man-Machine track ""The Model"".  Radio DJs were more interested in the B-side so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with ""The Model"" as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making ""The Model"" Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country. As a result, the Man-Machine album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the album chart in February 1982. The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically, Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording Computer World.
Kraftwerk returned to live performance with the Computer World tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. They also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronized with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturized instruments during the set, and the use of replica mannequins of themselves to perform on stage during the song ""The Robots"".

Electric Café (1982–1989)
In 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title Technicolor but due to trademark issues was changed to Electric Café for its original release in 1986 (for a remastered re-release in 2009, it was retitled again after its original working title, Techno Pop). One of the songs from these recording sessions was ""Tour de France"", which EMI released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession for cycling. After the physically demanding Computer World tour, Ralf Hütter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. ""Tour de France"" included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone. ""Tour de France"" was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere. ""Tour de France"" was featured in the 1984 film Breakin', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on black American dance music.
In May or June 1982, during the recording of ""Tour de France"", Ralf Hütter was involved in a serious cycling accident. He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Flür was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Flür was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year's Computer World or on the 1986 album Electric Café. In 1987 he left the band and was replaced by Fritz Hilpert.

The Mix (1990–1999)
After years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album The Mix. Hütter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited Fernando Abrantes as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.
In 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival Tribal Gathering held in England. In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in Brazil and Argentina. Three new songs were performed during this period and a further two tested in soundchecks, which remain unreleased. Following this trek, the group decided to take another break.
In July 1999 the single ""Tour de France"" was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been out of print for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Flür and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Flür published his autobiography in Germany, Ich war ein Roboter. Later English-language editions of the book were titled Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot.
In 1999, Kraftwerk were commissioned to create an a cappella jingle for the Hannover Expo 2000 world's fair in Germany. The jingle was subsequently developed into the single ""Expo 2000"", which was released in December 1999, and remixed and re-released as ""Expo Remix"" in November 2000.

Tour de France Soundtracks and touring the world (2000–2009)
In August 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks, its first album of new material since 1986's Electric Café. In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive Minimum-Maximum world tour, using four customised Sony VAIO laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. Hütter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating ostinato. Schneider's live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in Edinburgh, Scotland, performing ""Aerodynamik"". The same year a promotional box set entitled 12345678 (subtitled The Catalogue) was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow.  The box featured remastered editions of the group's eight core studio albums, from Autobahn to Tour de France Soundtracks. This long-awaited box-set was eventually released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.
In June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, Minimum-Maximum, which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received extremely positive reviews. The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled ""Planet of Visions"" that was a reworking of ""Expo 2000"". In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece. In December, the Minimum-Maximum DVD was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.
In April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Denver, and were a coheadliner at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. Hütter stated that he was working on other projects. On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider's departure from the band; The Independent commented: ""There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career. Many successful bands break up after just a few years. It has apparently taken Schneider and his musical partner, Ralf Hütter, four decades to discover musical differences."" Kraftwerk's headline set at Global Gathering in Melbourne, Australia, on 22 November was cancelled moments before it was scheduled to begin, due to Fritz Hilpert experiencing a medical emergency.
In 2009, Kraftwerk performed concerts with special 3D background graphics in Wolfsburg, Germany; Manchester, UK; and Randers, Denmark. Members of the audience were able to watch this multimedia part of the show with 3D glasses, which were given out. During the Manchester concert (part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival) four members of the GB cycling squad (Jason Kenny, Ed Clancy, Jamie Staff and Geraint Thomas) rode around the Velodrome while the band performed ""Tour de France"". The group also played several festival dates, the last being at the Bestival 2009 in September, on the Isle of Wight. 2009 also saw the release of The Catalogue box set in November. It is a 12-inch album-sized box set containing all eight remastered CDs in cardboard slipcases, as well as LP-sized booklets of photographs and artwork for each individual album.

The Catalogue and continued touring (2010–2017)
Although not officially confirmed, Ralf Hütter suggested that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: ""We've just never really taken a look at those albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days."" Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.
Kraftwerk played at Ultra Music Festival in Miami on 23 March 2012. Initiated by Klaus Biesenbach, the Museum of Modern Art of New York organized an exhibit titled Kraftwerk – Retrospective 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 where the band performed their studio discography from Autobahn to Tour de France over the course of eight days to sell-out crowds. The exhibit later toured to the Tate Gallery as well as to K20 in Düsseldorf. Kraftwerk performed at the No Nukes 2012 Festival in Tokyo, Japan. Kraftwerk were also going to play at the Ultra Music Festival in Warsaw, but the event was cancelled; instead, Kraftwerk performed at Way Out West in Gothenburg. A limited edition version of the Catalogue box set was released during the retrospective, restricted to 2000 sets. Each box was individually numbered and inverted the colour scheme of the standard box. In December, Kraftwerk stated on their website that they would be playing their Catalogue in Düsseldorf and at London's Tate Modern. Kraftwerk tickets were priced at £60 in London, but fans compared that to the $20 ticket price for tickets at New York's MoMA in 2012, which caused consternation. Even so, the demand for the tickets at The Tate was so high that it shut down the website.
In March 2013, the band was not allowed to perform at a music festival in China due to unspecified ""political reasons"". In an interview in June after performing the eight albums of The Catalogue in Sydney, Ralf Hütter stated: ""Now we have finished one to eight, now we can concentrate on number nine."" In July, they performed at the 47th Montreux Jazz Festival. The band also played a 3-D concert on 12 July at Scotland's biggest festival – T in the Park – in Balado, Kinross, as well as 20 July at Latitude Festival in Suffolk, and 21 July at the Longitude Festival in Dublin.
In October 2013 the band played four concerts, over two nights, in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The venue, Evoluon (the former technology museum of Philips Electronics, now a conference center) was handpicked by Ralf Hütter, for its retro-futuristic UFO-like architecture. Bespoke visuals of the building, with the saucer section descending from space, were displayed during the rendition of Spacelab.
In 2014, Kraftwerk brought their four-night, 3D Catalogue tour to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and at NYC's United Palace Theatre. They also played at the Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden and at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan. In November 2014 the 3D Catalogue live set was played in Paris, France, at the brand new Fondation Louis-Vuitton from 6 to 14 November. and then in the iconic Paradiso concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where they played before in 1976. In 2015, Ralf Hütter, being told that the Tour de France would be starting that year in the nearby Dutch city of Utrecht, decided that Kraftwerk would perform during the ""Grand Départ"". Eventually the band played three concerts 3 and 4 July in TivoliVredenburg performing ""Tour de France Soundtracks"" and visited the start of the Tour in-between.
At the request of race director Christian Prudhomme, Kraftwerk performed at the Tour de France on 1 July 2017, this time in Kraftwerk's hometown Düsseldorf. French electronic band Air opened the concert, invited by Kraftwerk. Concertgoers were offered 3D glasses to perceive stereoscopic effects on the video screen.

3-D The Catalogue and Schneider's death (2017–present)
In April 2017, Kraftwerk announced 3-D The Catalogue, a live album and video documenting performances of all eight albums in The Catalogue that was released 26 May 2017. It is available in multiple formats, the most extensive of which being a 4-disc Blu-ray set with a 236-page hardback book. The album was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Surround Sound Album at the ceremony that took place on 28 January 2018, winning the former, which became the band's first Grammy win.
On 20 July 2018, at a concert in Stuttgart, German astronaut Alexander Gerst performed ""Spacelab"" with the band while aboard the International Space Station, joining via a live video link. Gerst played melodies using a tablet as his instrument alongside Hütter as a duet, and delivered a short message to the audience.
On 20 July 2019, Kraftwerk headlined the Saturday night lineup on the Lovell Stage at Bluedot Festival, a music and science festival held annually at Jodrell Bank Observatory, Cheshire, UK. The 2019 festival celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
On 21 April 2020, Florian Schneider died at age 73 after a brief battle with cancer. On 3 July 2020, the German-language versions of Trans Europe Express, The Man Machine, Computer World, Techno Pop and The Mix, alongside 3-D The Catalogue, were released worldwide on streaming services for the first time.
On 21 December 2020, Parlophone/WEA released Remixes, a digital compilation album. It includes remixed tracks taken from singles released 1991, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2007, plus the previously unreleased ""Non Stop"", a version of ""Musique Non-Stop"" used as a jingle by MTV Europe beginning in 1993. The cover re-uses the cover from ""Expo Remix"". The compilation was released on CD and vinyl in 2022.
On 30 October 2021, Kraftwerk were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In November 2021, the band announced plans for a 2022 North American tour. With the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary, the Remixes compilation album came out on compact disc and vinyl for the first time in addition.
From 27 May to 10 July 2022, the formation undertook a successful North American tour, performing in 24 cities.
In May 2024, they will hold a residency in Los Angeles at Walt Disney Concert Hall performing their albums.

Music and artistry
Style
Kraftwerk have been recognized as pioneers of electronic music as well as subgenres such as electropop, art pop, house music, synth-pop and electronic rock. In its early incarnation, the band pursued an avant-garde, experimental rock style inspired by the compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Hütter has also listed the Beach Boys as a major influence. The group was also inspired by the funk music of James Brown and, later, punk rock. They were initially connected to the German krautrock scene. In the mid-1970s, they transitioned to an electronic sound which they described as ""robot pop"". Kraftwerk's lyrics dealt with post-war European urban life and technology—traveling by car on the Autobahn, traveling by train, using home computers, and the like. They were influenced by the modernist Bauhaus aesthetic, seeing art as inseparable from everyday function. Usually, the lyrics are very minimal but reveal both an innocent celebration of, and a knowing caution about, the modern world, as well as playing an integral role in the rhythmic structure of the songs. Many of Kraftwerk's songs express the paradoxical nature of modern urban life: a strong sense of alienation existing side by side with a celebration of the joys of modern technology.
Starting with the release of Autobahn, Kraftwerk began to release a series of concept albums (Radio-Activity, Trans-Europe Express, The Man-Machine, Computer World, Tour de France Soundtracks). All of Kraftwerk's albums from Trans Europe Express onwards, except Tour de France Soundtracks, have been released in separate versions: one with German vocals for sale in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and one with English vocals for the rest of the world, with occasional variations in other languages when conceptually appropriate. Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk's activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live improvisation often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group's roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band's familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.

Technological innovations
Throughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of music technology with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices. The group has always perceived their Kling Klang Studio as a complex music instrument, as well as a sound laboratory; Florian Schneider in particular developed a fascination with music technology, with the result that the technical aspects of sound generation and recording gradually became his main fields of activity within the band.  Alexei Monroe called Kraftwerk the ""first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into non-academic electronic music"".

Kraftwerk used a custom-built vocoder on their albums Ralf und Florian and Autobahn; the device was constructed by engineers P. Leunig and K. Obermayer of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig. Hütter and Schneider hold a patent for an electronic drum kit with sensor pads, filed in July 1975 and issued in June 1977. It must be hit with metal sticks, which are connected to the device to complete a circuit that triggers analog synthetic percussion sounds. The band first performed in public with this device in 1973, on the television program Aspekte (on the all-German channel Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), where it was played by Wolfgang Flür. They created drum machines for Autobahn and Trans-Europe Express.
On the Radio-Activity tour in 1976 Kraftwerk tested out an experimental light-beam-activated drum cage allowing Flür to trigger electronic percussion through arm and hand movements. Unfortunately, the device did not work as planned, and it was quickly abandoned. The same year Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider commissioned Bonn-based ""Synthesizerstudio Bonn, Matten & Wiechers"" to design and build the Synthanorma Sequenzer with Intervallomat, a 4×8 / 2×16 / 1×32 step-sequencer system with some features that commercial products couldn't provide at that time. The music sequencer was used by the band for the first time to control the electronic sources creating the rhythmic sound of the album Trans-Europe Express.
Since 2002, Kraftwerk's live performances have been conducted with the use of virtual technology (i.e. software replicating and replacing original analogue or digital equipment). According to Fritz Hilpert, ""the mobility of music technology and the reliability of the notebooks and software have greatly simplified the realization of complex touring setups: we generate all sounds on the laptops in real time and manipulate them with controller maps. It takes almost no time to get our compact stage system set up for performance. [...] This way, we can bring our Kling-Klang Studio with us on stage. The physical light weight of our equipment also translates into an enormous ease of use when working with software synthesizers and sound processors. Every tool imaginable is within immediate reach or just a few mouse clicks away on the Internet.""

Reclusiveness and eccentricity
The band is also known for being notoriously reclusive, providing rare and enigmatic interviews, using life-size mannequins and robots while conducting official photo shoots, refusing to answer fanmail and barring visitors from the Kling Klang Studio, the precise location of which they used to keep secret.
Another notable example of this eccentric behavior was reported to Johnny Marr of the Smiths by Karl Bartos, who explained that anyone trying to contact the band for collaboration would be told the studio telephone did not have a ringer since, while recording, the band did not like to hear any kind of noise pollution. Instead, callers were instructed to phone the studio precisely at a certain time, whereupon the phone would be answered by Ralf Hütter, despite never hearing the phone ring.
Chris Martin of Coldplay recalled in a 2007 article in Q magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody from the track ""Computer Love"" on ""Talk"" from the album X&Y. He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said ""yes"".

Influence and legacy
According to music journalist Neil McCormick, Kraftwerk might be ""the most influential group in pop history"". NME wrote: ""'The Beatles and Kraftwerk' may not have the ring of 'the Beatles and the Stones', but nonetheless, these are the two most important bands in music history"". AllMusic wrote that their music ""resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late 20th century"".
Kraftwerk's musical style and image can be heard and seen in 1980s synth-pop groups such as Gary Numan, Ultravox, John Foxx, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), The Human League, Depeche Mode, Visage, Soft Cell and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Kraftwerk influenced other forms of music such as hip hop, house, and drum and bass, and they are also regarded as pioneers of the electro genre. Karl Hyde of Underworld has referenced Kraftwerk as a prominent influence. Most notably, ""Trans Europe Express"" and ""Numbers"" were interpolated into ""Planet Rock"" by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, one of the earliest hip-hop/electro hits. Kraftwerk helped ignite the New York electro-movement. Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson & Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class black people residing in Detroit at this time.
Depeche Mode's composer Martin Gore said: ""For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers"". Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records, purchased the vocoder used by Kraftwerk in their early albums, comparing it to owning ""the guitar Jimi Hendrix used on 'Purple Haze'"". Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, founding members of OMD, have stated that Kraftwerk was a major reference on their early work, and covered ""Neon Lights"" on the 1991 album, Sugar Tax. The electronic band Ladytron were inspired by Kraftwerk's song ""The Model"" when they composed their debut single ""He Took Her to a Movie"". Aphex Twin noted Kraftwerk as one of his biggest influences and cited Computer World as a very influential album towards his music and sound. Björk has cited the band as one of her main musical influences. Electronic musician Kompressor has cited Kraftwerk as an influence. The band was also mentioned in the song ""Rappers We Crush"" by Kompressor and MC Frontalot (""I hurry away, get in my Chrysler. Oh, the dismay!/Someone's replaced all of my Backstreet Boys with Kraftwerk tapes!""). Dr. Alex Paterson of the Orb listed The Man-Machine as one of his 13 favourite albums of all time. According to NME, Kraftwerk's pioneering ""robot pop"" also spawned groups like The Prodigy and Daft Punk.
Kraftwerk inspired many acts from other styles and genres, along with having their work been repeatedly sampled. David Bowie's ""V-2 Schneider"", from the 1977's ""Heroes"" album, was a tribute to Florian Schneider. Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music. New Order also sampled ""Uranium"" in its biggest hit ""Blue Monday"". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of ""Hall of Mirrors"" on their 1987 album Through the Looking Glass, which was lauded by Ralf Hütter: ""In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of 'Hall of Mirrors' by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary, just like the arrangements of Alexander Bălănescu for his Balanescu Quartet release [of Possessed, 1992]. We also like the album El Baile Alemán of Señor Coconut a lot."" Members of Blondie have admitted on several occasions that Kraftwerk were an important reference for their sound by the time they were working on their third album Parallel Lines. The worldwide hit ""Heart of Glass"" turned radically from an initial reggae-flavoured style to its distinctive electronic sound in order to imitate the technological approach of Kraftwerk's albums and adapt it to a disco concept. Simple Minds and U2 each recorded cover versions of ""Neon Lights""; Simple Minds' version was included on their 2001 all-covers album Neon Lights, and U2 included ""Neon Lights"" as the B-side of their 2004 single ""Vertigo"". LCD Soundsystem song called ""Get Innocuous!"" is built on a sample of ""The Robots"". Rammstein also covered their song ""Das Modell"", releasing it as a non-album single in 1997. John Frusciante cited the group's ability to experiment of as an inspiration when working in a recording studio.
In 1989, a speeded up version of Kraftwerk's song ""Electric Café"" began appearing as the theme song for a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live called ""Sprockets"", a German television spoof by Mike Myers. The 1998 comedy The Big Lebowski features a fictional band called Autobahn, a parody of Kraftwerk and their 1974 record Autobahn.
In January 2018, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the 30-minute documentary Kraftwerk: Computer Love, which examined ""how Kraftwerk's classic album Computer World has changed people's lives.""
In October 2019, Kraftwerk were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2020. On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk were announced as an official inductee into the Hall, for the class of 2021.
Their technical application and sound dynamics have been cited numerous times as being the foundation for both the development of hip hop and techno.

Good evening Kraftwerk, good evening Stuttgart! by the European Space Agency"
Kyle Bobby Dunn,"Kyle Bobby Dunn (born February 27, 1986) is a Canadian composer, arranger, and live performer of modern compositional and guitar based drone music. He has performed in live and exclusive outdoor settings, including Banff National Park, since 2000 and has released music on various international recording labels.
His work has been described as ""compositions that are patience incarnate"" and ""encourage an emotional response even as its seemingly infinite, creeping swirl and hum threatens to numb. A difficult feat.""
It is music that often ""captures a mood somewhere between sadness and strength; it's the sound of a respite that occurs after having survived an ordeal; it's sound as memory, as memorial.""
The austere, tempered tonal shifts featured in many of his compositions subtly echo the work of minimalist forerunners like Morton Feldman and La Monte Young. At the same time Dunn occasionally intersperses quaint, almost chamberal touches which evoke more traditionally classical sources.
Drawing from cinematic and classical music as much as drone and ambient, Dunn operates outside of categories, instead viewing the music he makes as a personal and reflective document of his experience, as ""soundtrack suites"" to his own life: past, present and future.

Background & Musical History
First realized in Calgary, Alberta, Dunn started composing and arranging his music for homemade films mostly on piano and cassette tapes (audio and video) in the late 1990s. His first love was filmmaking and it was film music that initially attracted him to composing his own works. He began performing and recording under the names 'Subtract by Two' and Kyle Bobby Dunn  with the first self-released album, Music for Medication around 2002–2003.
In interviews he has often mentioned large admiration for classical and soundtrack composers including Arvo Pärt, Valentin Silvestrov, John Williams, Ennio Morricone and Jerry Fielding, yet his own music often exhibits a more quiet, minimalist, and droning nature that is often compared to ambient contemporary musicians William Basinski, Brian Eno and Stars of the Lid.
Releasing what he has referred to as his 'first proper full length' album, Fragments & Compositions of Kyle Bobby Dunn, on Boston's Sedimental label in 2008.
The album covered several years of his earliest compositional works, mainly for strings and piano.
In early 2010, a long form album that filled a double compact disc set containing five years worth of his music, A Young Person's Guide to Kyle Bobby Dunn, released on the UK based label Low Point, received positive reviewed by Steve Smith at The New York Times as ""something like a chamber-music equivalent of Kirlian photography: dark, shadowy and indistinct at its core, surrounded by an iridescent glow. The effect is mysterious, hypnotic and deeply affecting.""
He released Ways of Meaning in 2011 on Buffalo, New York imprint, Desire Path Recordings, to unanimously positive reception. The Huffington Post's Daniel Kushner wrote, ""Dunn presents the listener with sounds that seemingly, have no beginning, nor any end. There are not so much melodies, in the conventional sense – but rather an economical assemblage of tones, which linger in the air like the quivering brush strokes in an Impressionist still life.""
In 2012 he released another double disc set of long form works on the Low Point label. Bring Me the Head of Kyle Bobby Dunn was recorded at the artist's Bunce Cake studio and throughout remote locations in his native Canada. The recordings revealed a most personal and deeply emotional aspect of the composer's work and reached a high standard for electronically produced and arranged music – only utilizing an electric guitar and loop station pedal for the album's 15 songs. The disc received a largely positive response and was heralded by Resident Advisor as being among his finest work.
In addition to the massive double disc release of 2012, a five song vinyl record was released later in the year on the Toronto label, Komino. It was considered as ""a tightening of the composer's sound – the signature elements are there; cyclical patterns, drifts of spidery drones, buried static, but though they somehow seem slower and more stately than before, they seem focused, resolute"" and ""in a quiet master class in poised composition; constantly in motion, and in perfect stillness"" by John Boursnell at UK's Fluid Radio.
In mid 2014 he released his largest full-length release album to date, 'Kyle Bobby Dunn & The Infinite Sadness.' The album is one of the artist's largest and most emotionally complex release with many of the previous guitar laden sounds of previous releases stretched out to long crescendos and intricate melodic development. The release is available on the triple vinyl and double compact disc formats.
After a few years of almost complete silence, 2019 saw the artist release the even longer, nearly 3 hour album 'From Here to Eternity,' with positive accolades and reviews from many notable music journalists — and made available in the most ambitious format so far, a quadruple vinyl release that was paired with nearly 3 more hours of sketches and B-side material that failed to make the original album cut.  
Pitchfork Media gave the release an 8.0 rating, which is rare for drone music covered on the site, and wrote ""there is a coppery burnish that was not there before, a tendency to float just beyond the bounds of our usual limits of musical perception. There is a sense of presence here that’s hard to put your finger on—an undercurrent, a shadow, something felt but not heard.""
In 2020 and during much of the COVID-19 pandemic he began releasing archival works from past sessions and unreleased material or versions as Selected Ambient Expansion Pack, and has in the last year released what appears to be a 4 part series of an album documenting his latest work during the pandemic restrictions and winter long curfew that was set in the province of Quebec. The Cohesive Redundancies, is only available digitally through the artist's official Bandcamp release site.
In 2022 he began releasing work digitally called the WGR collection and also stands as a document of sound art, available once again exclusively on the bandcamp page. The material varied wildly in most areas from previous work and was sourced almost entirely from very old vinyl records. The project is still potentially open to include further works, but currently is many hours in length and 100 suites long.

Laraaji,"Laraaji (born Edward Larry Gordon, 3 May 1943) is an American multi-instrumentalist specializing in piano, zither and mbira. His albums include  the 1980 release Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, produced by Brian Eno as part of his Ambient series.

Early life and career
Born Edward Larry Gordon in Philadelphia, he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey.  He attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., where he studied composition and piano.  After studying at Howard, he spent time in New York City pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian and actor, as well as playing Fender Rhodes electric piano in a jazz-rock band ‘Winds of Change’.
In the early 1970s, he began to study Eastern mysticism and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life.  It was also at this time he bought his first zither from a local pawn shop.  Converting it to an electronic instrument, he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano.  By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin busking in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York. He favored the northeast corner of Washington Square Park, where he would improvise for hours on end with his eyes closed.
The following year he was encountered by Brian Eno while playing in Washington Square Park, who went on to produce his most widely recognized release, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, the third installment of Brian Eno's Ambient series.  This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji.
This international exposure led to requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to meditation groups on cassette tapes.  It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as Swami Satchidananda and Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.
In 2022, Laraaji joined with Medicine Singers—a group of Native American ritual performance artists in partnership with other artists—to play on their self-titled album.
Laraaji started the Laughter Meditation Workshops, which he still presents around the globe.

Critical reception
In 2023, Pitchfork awarded Segue To Infinity ""Best New Reissue"" and declared that the album ""should definitively put a nail in the coffin of the narrative of Laraaji as a street busker who was simply “discovered” by (Brian) Eno, instead cementing him as an preeminent figure in ambient and new-age music’s history.""

Eternity or Bust, a short film about Laraaji"
Loreena McKennitt,"Loreena Isabel Irene McKennitt  (born February 17, 1957) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer who writes, records, and performs world music with Celtic and Middle Eastern influences. McKennitt is known for her refined and clear soprano vocals. She has sold more than 14 million records worldwide.

Early life and education
McKennitt was born in Morden, Manitoba, of Irish and Scottish descent to parents Jack McKennitt (died 1992) and Irene née Dickey (1931–2011). In Morden, she developed her love for music, influenced, in part, by the musical traditions of the local Mennonite community.
McKennitt enrolled at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg to become a veterinarian. While in Winnipeg she discovered folk music, including fellow Canadians Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Gordon Lightfoot. After performing at the inaugural Winnipeg Folk Festival in 1974, McKennitt developed an interest in Celtic music and visited Ireland to hear it for herself. Developing a passion for Celtic music, she learned to play the Celtic harp and began busking at various places, including St. Lawrence Market in Toronto to earn money to record her first album.
In 1981, she moved to Stratford, Ontario, to join the Stratford Festival acting company, and still resides there.

Career
Initial success: 1985–1998
McKennitt's first album, Elemental, was released in 1985, followed by To Drive the Cold Winter Away (1987), Parallel Dreams (1989), The Visit (1991), The Mask and Mirror (1994), A Winter Garden (1995), and The Book of Secrets (1997). All of her work is released under her own label, Quinlan Road.
In 1990, McKennitt provided the music for the National Film Board of Canada documentary The Burning Times, a feminist revisionist account of the Early Modern European witchcraft trials. She and the musical team she headed would later re-record the documentary's main theme on her album The Visit under the title ""Tango to Evora"".
In 1993, she toured Europe supporting Mike Oldfield. In 1995, her version of the traditional Irish song ""Bonny Portmore"" was featured in the Highlander series, followed by the 1994 film Highlander 3: The Sorcerer. McKennitt's single ""The Mummers' Dance"" received airplay in North American markets during the spring of 1997, and was used as the theme song for the short-lived TV series Legacy. It also saw use in the trailer for a wide-release 1998 Drew Barrymore film Ever After.
Her music appeared in the movies The Santa Clause, Soldier, Jade, Holy Man, The Mists of Avalon, and Tinker Bell. It was also featured in the television series Roar, Due South, and Full Circle (Women and Spirituality).

Personal tragedy and hiatus
In July 1998, McKennitt's fiancé Ronald Rees, his brother Richard, and their close friend Gregory Cook drowned in a boating accident on Georgian Bay. She was deeply affected by the event, and she founded the Cook-Rees Memorial Fund for Water Search and Safety in the same year. At the time of the incident, she was working on a live album of two performances called Live in Paris and Toronto. The proceeds from this album were donated to the newly created memorial fund, totalling some three million dollars.
After the release of the live album, McKennitt decided that she would substantially reduce the number of her public performances, and she did not release any new recordings until the studio album An Ancient Muse in 2006.

Return to music: 2006–present
During 2005, McKennitt began work on the album that would become An Ancient Muse, her seventh full-length studio album, released in November 2006. In September 2006, she performed live at the Alhambra. The performance premiered on PBS and in August 2007 was released on a three-disc DVD/CD set titled Nights from the Alhambra.
In 2008, McKennitt wrote and composed a song she titled ""To The Fairies They Draw Near"" as the theme song for Disney's direct-to-video animated film Tinker Bell. She also provided the narration for the film.
In early 2008, she returned to Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios to record A Midwinter Night's Dream, an extended version of her 1995 mini-album A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season. The album was released on October 28, 2008.
Since the release of An Ancient Muse, McKennitt has toured consistently, with a European and North American An Ancient Muse tour in 2007 and another extensive tour across Canada and United States later in 2007, a tour of Europe in 2008 and a Mediterranean tour in 2009 with stops in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Hungary and Italy.
On September 17, 2009, McKennitt announced that she planned to release a two-disc album titled A Mediterranean Odyssey. The first CD, ""From Istanbul to Athens"", consisted of 10 new live recordings made during her 2009 Mediterranean tour, including songs she had never before recorded in concert. The second CD, ""The Olive and the Cedar"", had a Mediterranean theme which McKennitt herself curated. It contained previously released studio recordings created between 1994 and 2006.
November 16, 2010, saw the US release (November 12 for Europe) of McKennitt's latest studio album, The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Recorded at the Sharon Temple, Ontario, it consists of nine traditional Celtic songs. ""Every once and again there is a pull to return to one's own roots or beginnings, with the perspective of time and experience, to feel the familiar things you once loved and love still"", said McKennitt.
When McKennitt released The Wind that Shakes the Barley she visited several countries to help promote the album. During the promotional tour she performed an hour-long concert in the studios of German radio station SWR1, accompanied only by Brian Hughes (guitars) and Caroline Lavelle (cello) who have long been part of her tours and recordings. This live concert was released on CD in 2011. Called Troubadours on the Rhine, the album was nominated for a 2012 Grammy for Best New Age Album.
On November 30, 2012, McKennitt lent her support to Kate Winslet's Golden Hat Foundation together with Tim Janis, Sarah McLachlan, Andrea Corr, Hayley Westenra, the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys, Dawn Kenney, Jana Mashonee, Amy Petty, and a choir, along with others, performing on ""The American Christmas Carol"" concert at Carnegie Hall.
McKennitt's 10th studio album, Lost Souls, was released on May 11, 2018. She planned a tour to support the album's release in 2018 and 2019.
She had a small acting role in the 2018 film Road to the Lemon Grove, as the voice of God.
In 2019, McKennitt released the live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall, recorded earlier that year in London.

Legacy
Genre
McKennitt's music has generally been classified as World or Celtic music even though it contains aspects and characteristics of music from around the globe and is sometimes classified as folk music in record stores.
McKennitt is occasionally compared to Enya, but McKennitt's music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as ""The Lady of Shalott"" by Lord Tennyson, ""Prospero's Speech"" (the final soliloquy in William Shakespeare's The Tempest), the Northumbrian murder ballad ""The Twa Sisters"" (which inspired ""The Bonny Swans"" on The Mask and Mirror), ""Snow"" by Archibald Lampman, ""Dark Night of the Soul"" by St. John of the Cross, Dante's Inferno, William Blake's ""Lullaby"", Yeats' ""The Stolen Child,"" ""The English Ladye and the Knight"" by Sir Walter Scott, and ""The Highwayman"" by Alfred Noyes.

Influences
Before McKennitt composes any music, she engages in considerable research on a specific subject which then forms the general concept of the album. Before creating Elemental and Parallel Dreams, she travelled to Ireland for inspiration from the country's history, folklore, geography and culture. The album The Mask and Mirror was preceded by research in Spain where she studied Galicia, a Celtic section of Spain, along with its abundant Arabic roots. The result was an album that included elements of Celtic and Arabic music. According to the jacket notes, her album An Ancient Muse was inspired by travels among and reading about the various cultures along the Silk Road.

Documentaries
Late in the 1990s, McKennitt created No Journey's End, a half-hour documentary, for American television in which she discussed the influences behind her music. No Journey's End contained excerpts from several songs from the albums Parallel Dreams, The Visit, and The Mask and Mirror It also shows live performances of the songs ""The Lady of Shalott"", ""Santiago"", and ""The Dark Night of the Soul"". It was later released on DVD and VHS, the former also containing music videos for ""The Mummers' Dance"" and ""The Bonny Swans."" A bonus copy of the DVD was included with the 2004 remastered versions of McKennitt's CDs.
In 2008, McKennitt released A Moveable Musical Feast, based on her 2007 An Ancient Muse tour. The DVD included interviews with McKennitt, her band, crew, fans and professional colleagues from the Canadian music industry.

Court case
In 2005, McKennitt was involved in an acrimonious court case in England when her former friend and employee, Niema Ash, published a book, Travels with Loreena McKennitt: My Life as a Friend, that contained intimate details of their friendship. McKennitt argued that much of the book contained confidential personal information that Ash had no right to publish. The English courts found that there had indeed been a breach of confidence and a misuse of McKennitt's private information, and the case set important precedents in the law of England and Wales on the privacy of public figures. The House of Lords affirmed the lower court's decisions in 2007.

Loscil,"Loscil is the electronic/ambient music project of Scott Morgan from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Morgan launched the project in Vancouver in 1998 while a member of the multimedia collective Multiplex, which curated audiovisual events at an underground cinema called The Blinding Light. The name Loscil is taken from the ""looping oscillator"" function (loscil) in Csound.
Morgan was also the drummer for the Vancouver indie band Destroyer. As Loscil, he has also produced numerous special projects, remixes, and collaborations with other musicians, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Murcof/Vanessa Wagner, Sarah Neufeld, Daniel Bejar, bvdub, Rachel Grimes, and Kelly Wyse.

Career
Loscil graduated from Simon Fraser University's School for the Contemporary Arts, where he studied with computer-music pioneer Barry Truax.

2000s
A self-released album titled A New Demonstration of Thermodynamic Tendencies caught the attention of experimental music label Kranky, which signed Morgan on to release his debut album Triple Point in 2001. The album features six tracks off his first independent release as well as four new tracks.
Loscil followed up the release with Submers, an aquatic-themed album. Each track on the album is named after a submarine. The last track on the album was produced in honour of the people who died on the Russian submarine K-141 Kursk.
Loscil's 2004 album First Narrows (a reference to the official name of the Vancouver bridge, also known as Lions' Gate Bridge) marked the incorporation of improvised performances by a number of guest musicians: Nyla Raney on cello, Tim Loewen on guitar and Jason Zumpano on Rhodes piano. Consequently, the music pieces (or tone poems) on First Narrows are ""more organic and looser in nature"" than Morgan's previous work.
Eight of Loscil's tone poems were featured on the film score of the 2004 documentary Scared Sacred by the award-winning documentary filmmaker Velcrow Ripper.
In 2005, Morgan released Stases, a collection of drones based upon the backgrounds of his work for Kranky. The album was made available as a free download-only release from One Records.
The theme of Loscil's fourth major album, released in 2006, continued the conceptual ascent that each of his previous albums took, from the ""subatomic level"" and watery depths of Triple Point and Submers, respectively, to the surface alluded to by First Narrows and the sky referenced in Plume.
Plume also continued Morgan's musical integration of other musicians' work into his ambient compositions, including those by Josh August Lindstrom on vibes and xylophone and Krista Michelle Marshall and Stephen Michael Wood on EBow guitar, as well as Zumpano again on piano.

2010s
In a 2014 interview with Exberliner, Loscil described a facet of his 2014 album thus: ""Vancouver is the ideal setting, and I say that in a sort of ironic way. The nature is so beautiful but it’s coupled with human intervention. [My 2014 album] Sea Island is really inspired by that contrast. That area being a nature reserve as well as an industrial area and an airport is both beautiful and kind of horrific. I relish that contrast. There’s a balance there that I find interesting from a musical perspective. It opens the door to interpretation.""
In December 2016, American webzine Somewherecold ranked Loscil's Monument Builders No. 4 on their Somewherecold Awards 2016 list.
In 2019, Loscil released Equivalents, a reworking of piano samples inspired by Alfred Stieglitz’ black-and-white photographs of clouds. Pitchfork described the album as ""full of wispy high pitches that swirl around waves of pink noise and slowly moving tone clusters.""

2020s
In March 2021, Loscil announced the May 28 release of a new 10-track album called Clara. As basis for the tracks, Loscil used a short orchestral recording, which is from a single three-minute composition performed by a 22-piece string orchestra in Budapest. Upon its release, Clara was met with critical acclaim, attaining on reviews aggregator Metacritic a score of 85, indicating ""universal acclaim"".

Low (David Bowie album),"Low is the eleventh studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 14 January 1977 through RCA Records. The first of three collaborations with the producer Tony Visconti and the musician Brian Eno that became known as the Berlin Trilogy, the project originated following Bowie's move to France in 1976 with his friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their drug addictions. There, Bowie produced and co-wrote Pop's debut studio album, The Idiot, featuring sounds the former would explore on his next record. After completing The Idiot, sessions for Low began at Hérouville's Château d'Hérouville in September 1976 and ended in October at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, where Bowie and Pop had relocated.
An art rock and experimental rock record influenced by German bands such as Tangerine Dream, Neu!, Harmonia and Kraftwerk, Low features Bowie's first explorations in electronic and ambient styles. Side one consists primarily of short, direct avant-pop song-fragments, with mostly downbeat lyrics reflecting Bowie's state of mind, and side two comprises longer, mostly instrumental tracks, conveying musical observations of Berlin. Visconti created the distinctive drum sound using an Eventide H910 Harmonizer, a pitch-shifting device. The cover artwork, a profile of Bowie from the film The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), was intended as a visual pun, meaning ""low profile"".
RCA refused to issue Low for three months, fearing it would be a commercial failure. Upon release, it divided critical opinion and received little promotion from RCA or Bowie, who opted to tour as Pop's keyboardist. Nevertheless, it reached number 2 in the UK and number 11 in the US. Two singles were released: ""Sound and Vision"", a UK top five, and ""Be My Wife"". The success prompted RCA to release The Idiot in March 1977. In mid-1977, Bowie played on Pop's follow-up album Lust for Life before recording his album ""Heroes"", which expanded on Low's musical approach and features a similar mix of songs and instrumentals.
In later decades, critics have rated Low one of Bowie's best works, and it has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. It influenced numerous post-punk bands and its drum sound has been widely imitated. A forerunner in the development of the post-rock genre of the 1990s, Low has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set.

Background and inspiration
In 1974, David Bowie developed a cocaine addiction. It worsened over the next two years, affecting his physical and mental state. He recorded Young Americans (1975) and Station to Station (1976), and filmed The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), while under the drug's influence. Bowie attributed his growing addiction to Los Angeles, where he moved from New York City in early 1975. His drug intake escalated to the point where, decades later, he recalled almost nothing of the recording of Station to Station, saying, ""I know it was in L.A. because I've read it was.""

After completing Station to Station in December 1975, Bowie began work on a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paul Buckmaster, who worked with Bowie on the 1969 album Space Oddity. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the music, but withdrew his work when he was invited to submit it along with the work of other composers: ""I just said, 'Shit, you're not getting any of it.' I was so furious, I'd put so much work into it."" The Station to Station co-producer Harry Maslin argued Bowie was ""burned out"" and could not complete the work. Bowie eventually collapsed, saying later, ""There were pieces of me laying all over the floor."" Only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack was released, evolving into the Low track ""Subterraneans"".
When Bowie presented his material for the film to the director Nicolas Roeg, Roeg decided it was unsuitable. He preferred a more folk-styled sound, although the soundtrack's composer John Phillips described Bowie's contributions as ""haunting and beautiful"". Six months after Bowie's proposal was rejected, he sent Roeg a copy of Low with a note that read, ""This is what I wanted to do for the soundtrack. It would have been a wonderful score.""
The soundtrack abandoned, Bowie decided he was ready to free himself from the Los Angeles drug culture and move back to Europe. He began rehearsals for the Isolar tour to promote Station to Station in January 1976; the tour began on 2 February. Though it was critically acclaimed, Bowie became a controversial figure during the tour. Speaking as his persona the Thin White Duke, he made statements about Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany that some interpreted as expressing sympathy for or promoting fascism. Bowie later blamed his erratic behaviour during this period on his addictions and precarious mental state, stating: ""It was a dangerous period for me. I was at the end of my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity.""
After performing the 7 May 1976 show in London, Bowie caught up with the former Roxy Music keyboardist and conceptualist Brian Eno backstage. The two had met occasionally since 1973. After leaving Roxy Music, Eno had released two solo albums in 1975 in the ambient genre: Another Green World and Discreet Music. Bowie listened to Discreet Music regularly on the American leg of the tour. The biographers Marc Spitz and Hugo Wilcken later recognised Another Green World in particular as a major influence on the sound Bowie aimed to create for Low; Christopher Sandford also cites Eno's Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) (1974) as an influence. Bowie and Eno became infatuated with the German musical movement known as krautrock, including the acts Tangerine Dream, Neu!, Kraftwerk and Harmonia. Eno had worked with Harmonia in the studio and on stage, and Bowie exhibited a krautrock influence on Station to Station, particularly its title track. After meeting, the pair agreed to stay in touch.

Development
At the conclusion of the Isolar tour on 18 May 1976, Bowie and his wife Angela moved to Switzerland, although the two would rarely spend time there. David booked studio time later in the summer at the Château d'Hérouville in Hérouville, France, where he made plans to write and produce an album for his old friend, the singer Iggy Pop. Although the two had been friends for many years, the last time they worked together officially was in 1973, when Bowie was hired to mix the Stooges' Raw Power (1973). After the Stooges' demise, Pop descended into drug addiction. By 1976, he was ready to get sober and accepted Bowie's invitation to accompany him on the Isolar tour and then move to Europe with him. The two relocated to the Château, where Bowie had recorded his 1973 covers album Pin Ups. Afterwards, Bowie travelled back to Switzerland, where he spent the next few weeks writing and planning his next album.
Bowie and Pop regrouped at the Château at the end of June 1976. Through August, they recorded what would become Pop's debut studio album The Idiot (1977). Bowie composed much of the music, and Pop wrote most of the lyrics, often in response to the tunes Bowie was creating. During the album's recording, Bowie developed a new process whereby the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by overdubs; the lyrics and vocals were written and recorded last. He heavily favoured this ""three-phase"" process, which he would use for the rest of his career. Because The Idiot was recorded before Low, it has been referred to as the unofficial beginning of Bowie's Berlin period, as its music features a sound reminiscent of that which Bowie would explore in the Berlin Trilogy.
After completing The Idiot, Bowie and Pop travelled to Hansa Studios in West Berlin to mix the album. Because Tony Visconti was already in line to co-produce Bowie's next album, Bowie called on him to help mix the record to familiarise himself with his new way of working. Bowie became fascinated with Berlin, finding it a place for a great escape. In love with the city, Bowie and Pop decided to move there in a further attempt to erase their drug habits and escape the spotlight. Although Bowie was ready to move fully to Berlin, he had already booked another month of studio time at the Château after The Idiot, so recording began there. Although The Idiot was completed by August 1976, Bowie wanted to be sure he had his own album in stores before its release. The Château owner and The Idiot bassist Laurent Thibault opined that ""[Bowie] didn't want people to think he'd been inspired by Iggy's album, when in fact it was all the same thing"".

Recording and production
History and personnel
The Low sessions began on 1 September 1976. The album had the working title New Music: Night and Day. Although Low is considered the first of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy, most of it was recorded at the Château d'Hérouville in France. Returning from the Station to Station sessions were guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray and percussionist Dennis Davis. Along with Eno, new members included Roy Young, the former keyboardist for the Rebel Rousers, and Ricky Gardiner, former guitarist of Beggars Opera. A guest during the Château sessions was Visconti's then-wife Mary Hopkin, credited as Mary Visconti. She contributed backing vocals to ""Sound and Vision"".
Bowie and Visconti co-produced the album, with contributions from Eno. Visconti, who was absent for the recording of Station to Station because of conflicting schedules, was brought back to co-produce after mixing The Idiot. In 2000, Bowie stressed Visconti's importance as co-producer, stating that ""the actual sound and texture, the feel of everything from the drums to the way that my voice is recorded,"" was due to Visconti. Eno was not a co-producer, despite being widely perceived as such. Visconti said: ""Brian is a great musician, and was very integral to the making of those three albums [Low, ""Heroes"" and Lodger]. But he was not the producer.""
Like The Idiot, the Low sessions began with Bowie and the rhythm players running through the backing tracks quickly, beginning in the evening and continuing into the night, which biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook believes fit the mood of the music perfectly. As he had done on Station to Station, Bowie left Alomar in charge of the guitar, bass and percussion arrangements, with instructions about how they should sound. Bowie brought many song ideas he had in Switzerland to the sessions; some, including ""What in the World"", were brought back from The Idiot.
According to biographer Paul Trynka, Eno arrived after the backing tracks for side one were ""essentially"" finished. Shortly before arriving, Eno had recorded with Harmonia, who would serve as a major influence on the recording of Low. On his arrival, Eno and Bowie sat down with the musicians and informed them of the next stage in the recording process. According to Young, they played tapes of the Man Who Fell to Earth soundtrack for the musicians and said they planned something similar. Young added he and some of the other musicians were not fond of the idea, as it was outside their experiences. Bowie thought RCA would feel the same way, warning: ""We don't know if this will ever be released, but I have to do this."" Visconti insisted on completing the project, telling Bowie and Eno: ""Wasting a month of my time with David Bowie and Brian Eno is not wasting a month of my time."" Two weeks into the project, Visconti compiled a tape and played it for Bowie, who was surprised and enthusiastic that they had an album.

Drum sound
Low is noted for its unusual drum sound, described by biographer David Buckley as ""brutal"" and ""mechanistic"". Davis played the drums, which Visconti processed using an Eventide H910 Harmonizer. The Harmonizer was the first commercially available pitch-shifting device, which could alter the pitch of a sound without changing the speed. When Bowie asked what it did, Visconti replied, ""It fucks with the fabric of time.""
Visconti rigged the Harmonizer to Davis's snare drum and monitored the results through his headphones. Speaking to Buckley, Visconti said: ""My brain nearly exploded when I found what I could do with drums."" He fed the pitch-altered sound back into the device, creating ""an infinite dropping of [the] pitch, ever renewing itself"".
Buckley describes the sound, particularly evident on ""Speed of Life"", ""Breaking Glass"" and ""Sound and Vision"", as ""revolutionary"" and ""stunning"". Davis said it sounded ""as big as a house"". Bud Scoppa of Phonograph Record compares the sound to ""cherry bombs exploding under tin cans"". Trynka writes that Davis's ""spirit and energy"" propel the album's first side ""ever onward"". On its release, Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine called the drum sound one of the best sounds he had ever heard; Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone later described it as ""one of rock's all-time most imitated drum sounds"".

Studio atmosphere
With no deadline or planned structure, the mood during the sessions, says Seabrook, was ""upbeat and relaxed"". The studio was in the middle of the French countryside, and the musicians bonded and experimented regularly. According to Trynka, Eno was responsible for Bowie's motivation. Even Alomar – the most resistant to Eno's ""avant-garde bullshit"" – warmed to the experimentation.
Seabrook writes that everyone ate together, watched the British television programme Fawlty Towers in their free time, and entertained each other with stories. Gardiner said, ""We had some good conversations about music, astrology – the world."" Davis was the ""comedian"" during the sessions, performing acts and telling tales. As well as contributing backing vocals to ""What in the World"", Pop was present throughout the sessions. Gardiner recalled him being ""fit, healthy and positive"". Like Davis, he encouraged a positive atmosphere by telling stories of his time with the Stooges. 
The sessions were not without problems. Most of the Château's staff were on holiday, leaving an inexperienced engineer and a kitchen staff who did not serve a variety of meals. Months after the sessions, Visconti said: ""We found the studio totally useless. The people who own it now don't seem to care. We all came down with dysentery."" Bowie and Visconti both contracted food poisoning.
Bowie was in a fragile state of mind throughout the sessions, as his days of cocaine addiction were not far behind him. ""Low was largely drug-free,"" he remarked. ""That was the first instance in a very long time that I'd gone into an album without anything like that to help me along. I was scared, because I thought that maybe my creativity had to be bound up with drugs – that it enhanced my ability to make music. But that album turned out okay."" He also had conflicts with his wife and faced legal problems after firing his manager Michael Lippman; he left the sessions in September 1976 to work on resolving the case. Despite the problems, Visconti recalled that he, Bowie and Eno were working ""at their peak"".
By the end of September, Bowie and Visconti had grown tired of the Château. Bowie was mentally drained; Visconti frustrated by the lack of outside assistance. After recording the wordless vocals for ""Warszawa"", Bowie, Visconti, Pop and Bowie's assistant Coco Schwab left France for West Berlin. The sessions continued at Hansa Studios. According to Nicholas Pegg and Seabrook, it was not the same ""Hansa by the Wall"" location where Low would be mixed and ""Heroes"" would be recorded. At Hansa, the final tracks, ""Weeping Wall"" and ""Art Decade"", were completed, as well as vocal overdubs for the Château recordings. Recording continued until early October 1976, and mixing was finished later that month.

Songs
Low features Bowie's first explorations of electronic and ambient music. Ultimate Classic Rock and Consequence of Sound retrospectively categorised Low as art rock and experimental rock, respectively. Along with its successor ""Heroes"", the songs on Low emphasise tone and atmosphere, rather than guitar-based rock. German bands like Tangerine Dream, Neu! and Kraftwerk influenced the music. Seabrook considers Neu! the biggest influence on Bowie's new musical direction; he explained that their 1975 album Neu! '75 is, like Low and ""Heroes"", characterised by a song/instrumental split and contains a song titled ""Hero"". Ron Hart of The Observer recognised Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity (1975) as an influence, noting that album's harmony of ""experimentalism and repetition"" as providing the template for Low.
Side one consists primarily of short, direct avant-pop song-fragments; side two comprises longer, mostly instrumental tracks. In 1977, Bowie said side one was about himself and his ""prevailing moods"" at the time and side two is about his musical observations of living in Berlin. Musically, one reviewer characterised side one as a direct extension of Young Americans and Station to Station. Regarding the song/instrumental split, Visconti said: ""We felt that getting six or seven songs with Bowie singing, with choruses and verses, still make for a good album ... then making the second side instrumental gave a perfect yin-yang balance."" Biographer Chris O'Leary writes that the instrumental pieces share the theme of ""a tour of an imaginary Eastern Europe by the isolate, paranoiac character of Low's manic side"". Some tracks, including ""Speed of Life"" and ""A New Career in a New Town"", were originally going to have lyrics, but Bowie could not come up with suitable words and left them as instrumentals. The instrumentals feature contributions from Eno, who used his portable EMS AKS synthesiser. Visconti recalled, ""It had no keyboard, just a joystick, and he came up with wonderful sounds you can hear all over the album that weren't produced by conventional instruments.""

Side one
Author Peter Doggett describes ""Speed of Life""  as a perfect opening track, in the sense that it brings the audience into ""a subject too profound for words"". It features a rapid fade-in that Pegg believes makes for a ""bizarre"" opener, writing that ""[it's as if] the listener has just arrived within earshot of something that's already started"". ""Breaking Glass"" is a song-fragment, featuring six lines of lyrics, two of them demanding the audience ""listen"" and ""see"". The lyrics were inspired by Angie Bowie's new relationship with drummer Roy Martin. Eno said of the track, ""the feeling around was that we'd edit together ... and turn it into a more normal structure"" before Alomar vetoed the idea and recommended leaving it as it was. Credited to Bowie, Murray and Davis, Alomar recalled the trio mainly composed the song. O'Leary writes ""What in the World"" was created around the beginning of the sessions and was possibly slated for inclusion on The Idiot; it features backing vocals from Pop. The song is one of the few tracks on Low to combine art rock with more straightforward pop. According to Pegg, it features a ""wall of synthesiser bleeps against a barrage of guitar sound [and] distorted percussion effects"". The lyrics describe a little girl who is stuck in her room.

""Sound and Vision"" contains wordless backing vocals from Hopkin, which she recorded before there were lyrics, a title or a melody. Bowie's vocals take a full 1:45 to appear; Eno insisted on this to ""confound listener expectations"". Described by Bowie as his ""ultimate retreat song"", the lyrics reflect his mental state following his long period of drug addiction. They provide a stark contrast to the music itself, which is more joyous and upbeat. Buckley writes that the track is the closest to a ""conventional pop song"" on the album. The lyrics of ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" reference an incident when Bowie kept ramming his car into that of a drug dealer who was ripping him off in Los Angeles. In a broader context, the lyrics are a metaphor for making the same mistake repeatedly and Bowie's obsessive need to travel and change his lifestyle. O'Leary calls the song ""the depression in the middle of the 'manic' side"". Seabrook considers it the only song on side one that has a definite beginning and end.
Bowie described his lyrics to ""Be My Wife"" as ""genuinely anguished, I think"". They reflect Bowie's feelings of loneliness, his inability to settle, and constitute a plea for human connections. Several biographers have suggested the lyrics allude to Bowie's failing marriage. Musically, the track is led by a ""barrelling bar-room piano"", played by Young. Wilcken writes that ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" and ""Be My Wife"" are the only tracks on Low that have more conventional song structures. ""A New Career in a New Town"", as its title suggests, is an instrumental that acts as a musical transition. It begins as an electronic piece, before moving into a more rock-style tune enhanced by a harmonica solo from Bowie. Doggett and O'Leary describe the solo as reminiscent of blues music. The title reflects Bowie's upcoming move to Berlin.

Side two
""Warszawa"", the opening track of what O'Leary calls Low's ""night"" side, is named after the Polish city of Warsaw, which Bowie visited in April 1976. He found the landscape to be desolate and wanted to capture this through music. Eno mostly composed the song. He heard Visconti's four-year-old son playing A, B, C in a constant loop on the studio piano and used this phrase to create the main theme. The piece is haunting, featuring wordless vocals from Bowie that Doggett describes as reminiscent of a ""monkish vocal chorale"". Buckley calls it the ""most startling"" piece on the album. In 1977, Bowie said that ""Art Decade"", a pun on ""art decayed,"" is about West Berlin, ""a city cut off from its world, art and culture, dying with no hope of retribution"". Heavily influenced by Eno's ambient work, the piece paints visual impressions and evokes feelings of melancholy and beauty. O'Leary writes that for a time, the piece was co-credited to Eno. Hansa engineer Eduard Meyer played cello on the track.
Bowie played every instrument on the third instrumental, ""Weeping Wall"". Influenced by minimalist composer Steve Reich, the main melody is an adaptation of the tune ""Scarborough Fair"". Bowie uses synthesisers, vibraphone, xylophone and wordless vocals to create a sense of frustration and imprisonment. The piece is reportedly meant to evoke the pain and misery caused by the Berlin Wall. Bowie described ""Subterraneans"" as a portrait of ""the people who got caught in East Berlin after the separation, hence the faint jazz saxophones representing the memory of what it was"". Originally recorded for the aborted The Man Who Fell to Earth soundtrack, the piece contains wordless vocals similar to ""Warszawa"". Doggett describes Bowie's saxophone solo as ""remarkable"".

Artwork and release
George Underwood, Bowie's school friend, designed Low's cover artwork. Similar to the artwork for Station to Station, it features an altered still frame from The Man Who Fell to Earth. Bowie is seen in profile as his character from the film, Thomas Jerome Newton, wearing a duffel coat set against an orange background. His hair is the same colour as the background, which Wilcken says ""underlines the solipsistic notion of place reflecting person, object and subject melding into one"". Wilcken notes that as The Man Who Fell to Earth was out of theatres by the time of Low's release, the design choice was not to promote the film, but to show the connection between it and the album. Buckley writes that the cover was a visual pun, meaning 'low profile'; many did not understand the joke until Bowie pointed it out in a later interview.
Bowie's previous albums, Young Americans and Station to Station, were massive commercial successes. RCA Records was eager to have another best-seller from the artist but, on hearing Low, label staff were shocked. In a letter to Bowie, RCA rejected the album and urged him to make a record more like Young Americans. Bowie kept the rejection letter on his wall at home. His former manager, Tony Defries, also tried preventing its release due to his royalty settlement in the artist's fortunes following their acrimonious 1975 split. After Bowie refused to make any changes, RCA delayed Low from its original planned release date in November 1976. According to Seabrook, the label's executives considered the album to be ""distinctly unpalatable"" for the Christmas market.
RCA eventually released Low on 14 January 1977—less than a week after Bowie's 30th birthday—with the catalogue number PL 12030. The album received little to no promotion from both RCA or Bowie, who felt it was his ""least commercial"" record to that point. He opted to tour as Iggy Pop's keyboardist instead. Low became a commercial success, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 37 before peaking at number two the following week; Slim Whitman's Red River Valley kept the album from the top spot. It remained on the chart for 30 weeks. In the US, Low entered the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart at number 82, peaking at number 11 four weeks later and remaining on the chart for 20 weeks.

Singles
""Sound and Vision"" was released as the first single on 11 February 1977, with the instrumental ""A New Career in a New Town"" as the B-side. It reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Bowie's highest charting new single in the UK since ""Sorrow"" in 1973. The song did not fare so well in the US, peaking at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and signalling Bowie's commercial downturn in the country until 1983. Although Bowie did not promote it, Pegg writes the single was an ""instant turntable favourite"" and was bolstered by the BBC's usage for television commercials. The single's UK success confused RCA executives. Bowie intimidated the label and persuaded RCA to release Pop's The Idiot in March 1977.
""Be My Wife"" was released as the second single on 17 June 1977, backed by the instrumental ""Speed of Life"". It became Bowie's first single that failed to chart since his pre-Ziggy days (1972). Despite this, a music video—his first since 1973—promoted the song. An extended version of ""Breaking Glass"" was released as a single in Australia and New Zealand in November 1978. The single edit was created by splicing in a repeated verse of the original album recording. This rare version was made available for the first time in 2017 on Re:Call 3, part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) compilation.

Critical reception
Upon release, Low divided critical opinion. Rolling Stone's John Milward said that ""Bowie lacks the self-assured humour to pull off his avant-garde aspirations"" and found the album's second side weaker than its first, due to the band inflicting ""discipline into Bowie's writing and performance"". Another reviewer, Dave Marsh, gave Low two stars out of five, finding a lack of ""thought"" and ""real songs"", calling the majority of side two ""as limpid as the worst movie soundtrack"". He ultimately found the record a new low point for the artist. A reviewer for Record Mirror found the album boring at first listen, and upon repeated listens, felt Bowie had hit an ""all time low"", releasing an album that lacks a ""genuine vision"" with in cohesive music and few lyrics. NME's Charles Shaar Murray gave the album an extremely negative assessment, describing it as ""a state of mind beyond desperation"". He felt that the record encouraged the listener to feel down and offered no help in getting back up, stating, ""It's an act of purest hatred and destructiveness. It comes to us in a bad time and it doesn't help at all."" Murray ultimately asked, ""Who needs this shit?""

In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau found side one's seven ""fragments"" to be ""almost as powerful as the 'overlong' tracks on Station to Station"", but described ""the movie music on side two"" as banal. He revised his opinion on the second side after the release of ""Heroes"", writing that Low ""now seems quite pop, slick and to the point even when the point is background noise"". Christgau included it at number 26 on his ""dean's list"" of the year's best albums for the 1977 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn found some of the album as ""striking"" and ""satisfying"" as Ziggy but felt the rest lacked mass appeal. Robin Denslow agreed, calling Low Bowie's ""least commercial"" yet ""most experimental"" work yet in The Guardian.
Other reviewers praised the record. NME's Ian MacDonald found Low ""stunningly beautiful [...] the sound of Sinatra reproduced by Martian computers"". He considered it a conceptual sequel to Station to Station and concluded that Low is ""the ONLY contemporary rock album"". Michael Watts of Melody Maker called it ""the music of Now"", praising the album as feeling ""right for the times"", despite its lack of popularity. A reviewer for Billboard described the second side as ""adventurous"" with an appeal that was as yet uncertain, while Canadian critic Dave Winnitowy found Low ""hideously interesting"". Though John Rockwell of The New York Times called the lyrics ""mindless"" and described the instruments as ""strange and spacey"", he found the album ""alluringly beautiful"". Sounds magazine's Tim Lott considered Low both Bowie and Eno's best work thus far and a ""mechanical classic"".
Bowie's musical direction perplexed some reviewers. Rockwell felt that Bowie's fans would find Low was his finest work after they overcame their shock at hearing it for the first time. In National RockStar, David Hancock was surprised the record was Bowie's, calling it ""his most bizarre and adventurous LP"". Kris Needs in ZigZag described Low as strange and shocking but believed it was one of Bowie's greatest achievements.  Phonograph Record's Bud Scoppa felt the album made little sense. He found it ""the most intimate and free recording this extraordinary artist has yet made"", and believed listeners would be ""baffled"" by it or ""give in"" to it.

Subsequent events
Although RCA was hoping he would tour to support Low, Bowie opted instead to continue to support Pop on his tour to promote The Idiot. Bowie was adamant about not taking the spotlight away from Pop, often staying behind his keyboards and not addressing the audience. The tour began on 1 March 1977 and ended on 16 April. At the end of the tour, Bowie and Pop returned to the studio to record Pop's second studio album Lust for Life (1977). Bowie played a minor role in Lust for Life, allowing Pop to compose his own arrangements for the tracks, resulting in a sound more reminiscent of Pop's earlier work. Recording took place at Hansa by the Wall in West Berlin and was completed in two and a half weeks, from May to June 1977. Although Bowie had told interviewers in 1978 he planned to do a third collaboration with Pop, the album would be their last official collaboration until the mid-1980s.
After completing Lust for Life in mid-June 1977, Bowie travelled to Paris to film a music video for ""Be My Wife"". He contacted Eno to discuss their next collaboration; recording for the follow-up ""Heroes"" took place at Hansa by the Wall from July to August 1977. Developing the  material found on Low, the songs on ""Heroes"" have been described as more positive in tone and more atmosphere than those of its predecessor. The albums are similarly structured, side one featuring more conventional tracks and side two mainly featuring instrumentals. Eno played a much greater role on ""Heroes"" than on Low, being credited as co-author of four of the ten tracks. Although well-received in its own right, critical and public opinion has typically favoured Low as the more groundbreaking record. The final release of the Berlin Trilogy, Lodger (1979), abandoned the electronic and ambient styles and the song/instrumental split that defined the two earlier works, in favour of more conventional song structures, which The Quietus described as presaging world music.

Influence and legacy
In the decades since its release, Low has been acclaimed for its originality and cited as an influence on the post-punk genre. Susie Goldring of BBC Music wrote: ""Without Low, we'd have no Joy Division, no Human League, no Cabaret Voltaire, and I bet, no Arcade Fire. The legacy of Low lives on."" Spitz also acknowledges the influence of the album on post-punk, naming Joy Division, Magazine, Gang of Four and Wire as bands influenced by Low's ""odd anti-aggression and unapologetic, almost metaphorical use of synthesised music"". Music journalist Simon Reynolds said: ""I think it's Low's inhibition and repression that Joy Division and others responded to. The fact that the music, while guitar-based and harsh and aggressive, never rocks out. It's imploded aggression."" James Perone suggested that both ""What in the World"" and ""Be My Wife"" foreshadowed the punk/new wave sound of English band the Stranglers, particularly their 1977 releases Rattus Norvegicus and No More Heroes.
In the second edition of his book All Time Top 1000 Albums (1998), Colin Larkin cites Gary Numan, Ultravox and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark as artists influenced by Low. Wilcken finds Radiohead's album Kid A (2000), particularly the track ""Treefingers"", to reflect a similar influence. William Doyle of The Quietus wrote that before the release of Kid A, Bowie created the blueprint ""reinvention"" album with Low, a record from an artist at the peak of their popularity that confounded his fans' expectations. Bjorn Randolph of Stylus Magazine felt the album had a crucial influence on the post-rock genre that came to prominence among underground musicians nearly two decades after Low's release. Doggett writes that, like Station to Station before it, Low established Bowie as an artist who was ""impossible to second-guess"". He found Bowie's five-year progression from Hunky Dory to Low daring and courageous.

Bowie's biographers have highlighted the influence the album had on Joy Division, as have the band themselves; their original name was ""Warsaw"", a reference to ""Warszawa"". Wilcken writes that Joy Division imitate the ""split mentality"" of Low on their final album Closer (1980), a record which contains progressively darker track sequencing. Joy Division's drummer Stephen Morris told Uncut magazine in 2001 that when making their 1978 An Ideal for Living EP, the band asked the engineer to make the drums sound like ""Speed of Life""; ""Strangely enough he couldn't."" Like Morris, many musicians, producers and engineers tried to imitate Low's drum sound. Visconti refused to explain how he crafted the sound, asking them instead how they thought it had been done. Approximations began appearing throughout the rest of the 1970s and, by the 1980s, were found on almost every record on the charts. Seabrook credits Bowie as being indirectly responsible for the ""thumping backbeat"" heard on tracks ranging from Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" to Duran Duran's ""Hungry Like the Wolf"". In an interview with Musician magazine in 1983, Bowie expressed his dismay, stating, ""That depressive gorilla effect was something I wish we'd never created, having had to live through four years of it with other English bands.""
Many musicians have discussed the album's influence. On learning the title of the album was Low (without an ""e""), English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe ""retaliated"" by naming his 1977 EP Bowi (without an ""e""). Robert Smith, of the English rock band the Cure, listened to the record frequently while making their 1980 album Seventeen Seconds. In 1994, musician Trent Reznor of the American rock band Nine Inch Nails cited Low as a key inspiration for The Downward Spiral (1994), crediting its ""song-writing"", ""mood"" and ""structure[s]"" as influences. Dave Sitek of the American rock band TV on the Radio stated: ""That particular album, that song 'Warszawa', that's when I knew music was the ultimate force, at least in my own life."" Bowie worked with the band in 2003.
In 1992, the American composer and pianist Philip Glass produced a classical suite based on the album, titled ""Low"" Symphony, his first symphony. It consisted of three movements based on Low tracks: ""Subterraneans""; ""Some Are"" (an outtake); and ""Warszawa"". The Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra recorded the symphony at Glass' Looking Glass Studios in New York and it was released in 1993. Speaking of the album, Glass said: ""They were doing what few other people were trying to do—which was to create an art within the realm of popular music. I listened to it constantly."" Of his decision to create a symphony based on the record, Glass said: ""In the question of Bowie and Eno's original Low LP, to me there was no doubt that both talent and quality were evident there... . My generation was sick to death of academics telling us what was good and what wasn't."" The ""Low"" Symphony acknowledges Eno's contributions to the original record and portraits of Bowie, Eno and Glass appear on the album cover. Bowie was flattered by the symphony and praised it, as did Pegg. Glass followed up the ""Low"" Symphony with classical adaptations of the other ""Berlin"" records with ""Heroes"" and Lodger in 1997 and 2019, respectively.

Reappraisal
Commentators continue to regard Low as one of Bowie's best works. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that with the album, Bowie ""confirmed his place at rock's cutting edge"", concluding that ""the record is defiantly experimental and dense with detail, providing a new direction for the avant-garde in rock & roll"". Dele Fadele of NME found the record a ""futuristic touchstone that still stands"". In 2001, Sheffield wrote that Low contained some of the artist's best work. ""[The album] flows together into a lyrical, hallucinatory, miraculously beautiful whole, the music of an overstimulated mind in an exhausted body, as rock's prettiest sex vampire sashays through some serious emotional wreckage."" Sheffield concluded by noting the timelessness of the record, calling it one of Bowie's ""most intense and influential"" records. Goldring praised the album as ""ambitious"" and felt it complimented Bowie's artistic growth, the singer having turned 30 on its release. In a 2013 readers' poll for Rolling Stone, Low was voted Bowie's fourth best album. The magazine noted its underappreciation at the time of release and the recognition as a masterpiece in the ensuing decades.
Some reviewers have considered Low Bowie's greatest artistic achievement. Following Bowie's death, Bryan Wawzenek of Ultimate Classic Rock listed Low as his greatest album, writing: ""Low is more than songs and sounds. The creative partnership behind the record forged a feeling, a mood, a place. Like very few of the best albums ever recorded, Low contains a universe you can inhabit, for 40 minutes at a time. It's Bowie's masterpiece."" Laura Snapes of Pitchfork gave the album a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it shows Bowie succeeding in setting a new path for himself following a period of drug addiction. Snapes summarises side one as feeling like ""having the carpet ripped out from under you by three wizards who have plans to fly it elsewhere"". Although she believed side two's instrumentals feel ""a little ponderous by today's standards"", their ability to provoke imagery of different worlds is ""something to behold"". The album's 40th anniversary in 2017 attracted reviews. Hart noted Low contains music that sounds both of its time and before its time, shrouded with ""forward-thinking artfulness"" that remains unmatched in 2017, further stating that it is an album ""that will make you dance, think and weep all in [...] 38 minutes."" Doyle praised Low's production and its ability to ""transport the listener to certain frontiers of place and thought in a very powerful way"". He described Low as ""a moment of pure discovery that most other records have failed to surpass"", adding that the record is open to interpretation by each listener.

Rankings
Low has frequently appeared on lists of the greatest albums of all time. Ranking the 100 best albums ever made, Sounds placed it at number 35 in 1986 and The Guardian ranked it number 62 in 1997. A year later, Q readers voted it the 43rd greatest album of all time. On lists of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, Q and The Observer ranked Low numbers 16 and 39, respectively. In 2004, Pitchfork named it the greatest album of the 1970s; Erlewine described it as ""a record that hurtles toward an undefined future while embracing ambiguity"", as well as ""an album about rebirth, which is why it still possesses the power to startle."" Similarly, Paste included it at number 34 in their list of the 70 best albums of the 1970s, and Ultimate Classic Rock later featured Low in a similar list of the 100 best rock albums from the 1970s in 2015. In 2013, NME listed the album as the 14th greatest of all time in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Larkin ranked it numbers 120 and 47 in the second and third editions of All Time Top 1000 Albums, respectively. In 2003, Low was ranked number 249 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was ranked number 251 in a 2012 revised list and number 206 in a 2020 revised list. In 2023, British GQ ranked it the second best electronic album of all time, behind Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine (1978).
The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Reissues
Low has been reissued several times.  RCA reissued the album on vinyl in 1980 and released it on compact disc for the first time in the mid-1980s. A 1991 CD release by Rykodisc contained three bonus tracks, including a remix of ""Sound and Vision"" and the outtakes ""Some Are"" and ""All Saints"". EMI released the 1991 edition in the UK on CD, Cassette and LP, while it was subsequently rereleased on AU20 Gold CD. The reissue charted at number 64 on the UK Albums Chart in September 1991. A 1999 CD release by EMI, without bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound. In 2017, the album was remastered for Parlophone's A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set. It was released in CD, vinyl and digital formats.

Ludovico Einaudi,"Ludovico Maria Enrico Einaudi OMRI (Italian: [ludoˈviːko eiˈnaudi] ; born 23 November 1955) is an Italian pianist and composer. Trained at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, Einaudi began his career as a classical composer, later incorporating other styles and genres such as pop, rock, folk, and world music.
Einaudi has composed the scores for a number of films and television productions, including This Is England, The Intouchables, I'm Still Here, the TV miniseries Doctor Zhivago, and Acquario (1996), for which he won the Grolla d'oro. His music was used as the score for the Golden Globe and Academy Award-winning films Nomadland and The Father.
He has also released a number of solo albums for piano and other instruments, notably I Giorni in 2001, Nightbook in 2009, and In a Time Lapse in 2013.  On 1 March 2019, Einaudi announced a seven-part project named Seven Days Walking, which was released over the course of seven months in 2019.
In 2005, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

Early life and education
Einaudi was born in Turin, Piedmont. His father, Giulio Einaudi, was a publisher working with authors including Italo Calvino and Primo Levi, and founder of Giulio Einaudi Editore, while his paternal grandfather, Luigi Einaudi, was President of Italy between 1948 and 1955. His mother, Renata Aldrovandi, played the piano to him as a child. Her father, Waldo Aldrovandi, was a pianist, opera conductor, and composer who emigrated to Australia after World War II.
Einaudi started composing his own music as a teenager, first writing by playing a folk guitar. He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, obtaining a diploma in composition in 1982. That same year he took an orchestration class taught by Luciano Berio and was awarded a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. According to Einaudi, ""[Luciano Berio] did some interesting work with African vocal music and did some arrangements of Beatles songs, and he taught me that there is a sort of dignity inside music. I learnt orchestration from him and a very open way of thinking about music."" He also learned by collaborating with musicians such as Ballaké Sissoko from Mali and Djivan Gasparyan from Armenia. His music is ambient, meditative, and often introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.

Music career
1980s
After studying at the conservatory in Milan and subsequently with Berio, Einaudi spent several years composing in traditional forms, including several chamber and orchestral compositions. He soon garnered international attention and his music was performed at venues such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Tanglewood Music Festival, Lincoln Center, and the UCLA Center for Performing Arts.
In the mid-1980s, he began to search for more personal expression in a series of works for dance and multimedia, and later for piano.
Some of his collaborations in theater, video, and dance included compositions for the Sul filo d'Orfeo in 1984, Time Out in 1988, a dance-theater piece created with writer Andrea De Carlo, The Wild Man in 1990, and the Emperor in 1991. Later collaborations include Salgari (Per terra e per mare) (1995), an opera/ballet commissioned by the Arena di Verona with texts by Emilio Salgari, Rabindranath Tagore, and Charles Duke Jr, and E.A. Poe (1997), which was conceived as a soundtrack for silent films.

Soundtracks
Einaudi began using his style to compose film soundtracks in the mid-1990s. He started with two films by Michele Sordillo, Da qualche parte in città in 1994 and Acquario in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d'oro for best soundtrack. In 1998, he composed the soundtrack for Treno di panna and the score for Giorni dispari by Dominick Tambasco.
In 2000, he collaborated with Antonello Grimaldi on Un delitto impossibile, and he also composed the soundtrack for Fuori del mondo, for which he won the Echo Klassik award in Germany in 2002. After the release of his debut album, some excerpts were included in the film Aprile by Nanni Moretti. In 2002, his soundtrack for Luce dei miei occhi was named best soundtrack at the 2002 Italian Music Awards.
In 2002, Einaudi won an Italian award for Best Film Score for Luce dei miei occhi. AllMusic gave his score for the 2002 TV serial Doctor Zhivago 4.5/5 stars and published a glowing review, comparing it in skill to Maurice Jarre's score of the previous film adaptation.
In 2004, his soundtrack for Sotto falso nome received the prize for the best film music at the Avignon Film Festival.
In 2010, Einaudi wrote the music for the trailer of Black Swan. His ""Due Tramonti"" was featured in the film I'm Still Here (2010), directed by Casey Affleck. His composition ""Nuvole Bianche"" was featured in the film Insidious (2010), directed by James Wan, the British TV drama This Is England 86, and in the TV series Derek (2012), directed by and starring Ricky Gervais. To The Intouchables (2011), the biggest box office movie in French history, he contributed the tracks ""Fly"", ""Writing Poems"", ""L'origine nascosta"", ""Cache-cache"", ""Una Mattina"", and ""Primavera.""  The film This Is England featured Fuori dal mondo and Dietro casa.  The British TV drama series This Is England '88 also contained the tracks ""Fuori Dalla Notte"", ""Solo"" (a bonus track from Nightbook), ""Berlin Song"", and ""Distacco"".

Solo releases
Einaudi is signed to Decca Records and is published by Chester Music Limited, part of the Music Sales Group of Companies.

After the multi-media-inspired Time Out in 1988, in 1992 he released Stanze, which he had composed for harp. The album was performed by Cecilia Chailly, one of the first musicians to use an electric harp. Einaudi released his first solo piano album, Le Onde, in 1996, under BMG. The album is based on the novel The Waves by British writer Virginia Woolf, and enjoyed mainstream success, particularly in Italy and the UK. His 1999 followup, Eden Roc, was also released on BMG, with shorter pieces. For the project he collaborated with the Armenian duduk musician Djivan Gasparyan.
His next solo piano release, I Giorni (2001), was inspired by his travels in Africa. The solo piano track ""I Giorni"" was featured in a BBC promotion for arts and culture programs, and attracted much interest due to Greg James' airing of the piece on BBC Radio 1 in June 2011. James mentioned that he found the piece therapeutic when he was studying at university. Due to repeated airings that month, the track entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on 12 June 2011.

In 2003, Einaudi released the live album La Scala Concert 03.03.03, which was recorded at the famous La Scala opera house in Milan. His 2003 album Diario Mali is another collaboration, with Einaudi on piano and Malian musician Ballaké Sissoko on kora. In 2004, Einaudi released the album Una Mattina on Decca Records. The 2006 album Divenire consists of piano accompanied by orchestra. The album also includes the artist's critically acclaimed track ""Primavera."" It was recorded by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with Einaudi as the piano master. Shortly after its release, Einaudi went on tour to various places in the UK, playing both the music on Divenire and orchestral arrangements of his other works. The album topped the iTunes classical chart.
In October 2009, Nightbook was released. The album saw Einaudi take a new direction with his music as he incorporated synthesized sounds alongside his piano. The album was conceived and recorded in response to the German painter and sculptor Anselm Kiefer, as well as an exhibit space where Einaudi performed for a gallery opening for Kiefer. It was also inspired by the drums and electronics of the Whitetree Project, a performing trio Einaudi formed with Robert and Ronald Lippok of To Rococo Rot, a German electronic group. In Italy, the album went Gold with more than 35,000 copies sold.
Einaudi's album In a Time Lapse was released on 21 January 2013, with US and Canadian supporting tours. He also appeared on KCRW in Los Angeles. On 17 September 2013, Einaudi performed various songs from In a Time Lapse, together with a new ensemble, at the annual iTunes Festival held at the Roundhouse in London. The group intimately rehearsed this performance in the barn of Einaudi's house. In March 2016, the world premiere of a new piano concerto, ""Domino"", took place at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.

Style
In a review of Elements, Classicalite's Steve Nagel writes that ""because Einaudi errs so much on the side of minimalism and pop that it might be more appropriate to label his music as a product of the New Age movement, which—although seemingly less ambitious than broader classical structures—concentrates more on relaxation, cohesion, elements of nature and an air of optimism"". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian, in a negative review of a 2016 live performance, critiques Einaudi the performer with ""[he] casts himself as the antithesis to the stuffy conservatoire—but then plays music that is less adventurous than your average indie band's"", complaining that ""Einaudi compounds this by being a mediocre pianist. He can finesse a phrase, but is proudly anti-virtuosic, playing only simple arpeggios and limpid four-note melodies"".

Personal life
In 2016, Einaudi participated in the Greenpeace campaign to save the Arctic.

Lustmord,"Brian Williams is a Welsh musician, sound designer and film score composer. He has released albums under the name Lustmord starting in the 1980s and through the present.
Williams began as a recording artist within the industrial genre, working with Chris & Cosey and SPK. Shifting his work to Lustmord, Williams continued to employ the threatening aesthetics of industrial, while employing reverb and similar effects to evoke an atmosphere of cosmic horror. Starting with the 1989 album Heresy, Lustmord albums have been centered on manipulating sampled recordings with a computer. These samples infamously included field recordings made in locations such as crypts, caves, and slaughterhouses. Williams now downplays the sinister connotations of these locations and says they were picked for ""acoustics"". 
The influence of Williams work on subsequent artists has led critics to call him ""a reluctant pioneer of the dark ambient genre who regards his music as neither dark nor ambient.""

Biography
Williams was raised in the town of Bethesda, Gwynedd in Wales in a family of working class origin. He moved to London, living in a Lambeth squat. There he befriended Throbbing Gristle members Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter, who urged him to make his own music.

As Lustmord
Williams began releasing records as Lustmord with a self-titled debut (as ""Lustmørd"") in 1980.  ""Lustmord"" in German translates literally as “lust murder,” and alludes to a painting tradition in Weimar-era Germany, in which artists like Otto Dix and George Grosz painted scenes of rape and mutilated female bodies that captured the nihilism of the interwar period.
Williams released Lustmord's sophomore album Paradise Disowned in 1984 on which he continued to refine his sound. Critics and Williams himself considered his Lustmord third album, 1989's Heresy, to be his breakthrough work. Williams has attributed Heresy's success to his use of an Atari computer as a digital audio workstation. In retrospectives of Lustmord's work and the dark ambient genre, critics have called Heresy a milestone.
Lustmord has extracted field recordings made in crypts, caves, and slaughterhouses, and combined it with occasional ritualistic incantations and Tibetan horns. His treatments of acoustic phenomena encased in digitally expanded bass rumbles have a dark-ambient quality. Some of Lustmord's most notable collaborations include Robert Rich on the critically acclaimed Stalker, Jarboe, John Balance of Coil, Monte Cazazza, Clock DVA, Chris & Cosey, Paul Haslinger, and experimental sludge group Melvins on Pigs of the Roman Empire. He worked with Tool again in 2019, providing the ocean and wave sound effects on the track ""Descending"" on their album Fear Inoculum.
Williams collaborated with Graeme Revell and Paul Haslinger to contribute as ""musical sound designer"" and occasionally as an additional composer on 44 Hollywood film soundtracks, most notably on The Crow and Underworld.

Lustmord worked on Tool's DVD singles and remixed versions of ""Schism"" and ""Parabola,"" which were released on 20 December 2005. Lustmord also contributed to Tool's 2006 album 10,000 Days with the atmospheric storm sounds on the title track, ""10,000 Days"". He later worked again with Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan, collaborating on Keenan's project Puscifer debut album ""V"" is for Vagina, as well as providing several remixes for ""V"" is for Viagra. The Remixes. Lustmord eventually generated a collection of dub remixes of several tracks from ""V"" is for Vagina known as ""D"" Is for Dubby - The Lustmord Dub Mixes. The nine-track LP was released as a digital download on 17 October 2008, available directly from the Puscifer website. He also did some additional music including the track ""The Western Approaches"" feat. Wes Borland on guitar for the documentary Blood into Wine.
Lustmord released the album [ O T H E R ] on California-based label Hydra Head Records in July 2008. It features guest appearances by Adam Jones, King Buzzo, and Aaron Turner.

Live performances
Lustmord appeared live for the first time in 25 years as part of the high mass observance by the Church of Satan. The ceremony took place on 6 June 2006. A recording of the performance titled Rising was released. Lustmord himself noted that the offer was ""one of those things that was just too funny to say 'no' to"".
Lustmord performed for the second time in 29 years at Unsound Festival Kraków on 22 October 2010.
Lustmord performed at Art's Birthday celebration (initiated by Robert Filliou) at Södra Teatern in Stockholm, Sweden, on 15 January 2011. He performed in New York for the first time on 9 and 10 April 2011 at the Unsound Festival, coming to the attention of the New York Times.
Lustmord's first performance in the Netherlands was in September 2011 at the Incubate Festival.
Lustmord played for the first time in Moscow, Russia, on 8 April 2012, at Cinema 35mm. Bad Sector played the first act of the show.

Video games
Around 1999, Lustmord was also involved with the video game Planescape: Torment—his work eventually went unused when the project changed direction. He provided music and sound design for a variety of other projects since, such as Far Cry Instincts, Underworld and NVIDIA demos, many of which include collaborations with Haslinger. He was also involved with the 2003 game Master of Orion. In 2015 he composed the soundtrack for Evolve with Jason Graves., and composed the soundtrack of the horror game Scorn together with Aethek.

Films
Lustmord composed the soundtrack of the 2017 film First Reformed and the 2020 film The Empty Man.
Lustmord had two songs used in the TV show Vikings: Valhalla seasons one and two: “Babel” and “Y Gair.”

Personal life
In early 1990s, Williams relocated to California from London with his wife Tracey, who is a fabricator at Legacy Effects. He is an atheist and has noted that while his ominous music gives an impression to some people that he's ""somehow dark and [he] live[s] in a castle or in a dungeon"", and that although he's ""very serious about certain aspects of [his] work"", he's ""not that serious about [himself]"".

M83 (band),"M83 (French pronunciation: [ɛm katʁ vɛ̃ tʁwa]) are a French electronic music group formed in Antibes in 1999. Initially the duo of multi-instrumentalists Nicolas Fromageau and Anthony Gonzalez, Fromageau parted ways shortly after touring for their second album Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Gonzalez remains the sole constant member of the project, as the primary songwriter and lead vocalist.
The band has released nine studio albums, including the Grammy Award-nominated Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, in addition to two soundtracks. Gonzalez records primarily on his own, with numerous guest musicians. The band is signed to Mute Records and found breakout success in 2011 with ""Midnight City"", Hurry Up, We're Dreaming's lead single. Their sound has been described as dream pop, new wave, shoegaze, as well as ambient.

Early life
Anthony Gerard Gonzalez (born 13 March 1980) grew up in Antibes, France together with his brother Yann. His family had a great interest in football and Gonzalez had trials with AS Cannes, while his maternal grandfather is the French international Laurent Robuschi. At the age of 14 he was injured, and turned to music instead when his parents bought him a guitar. He developed his interest in music and American culture at secondary school. With Fromageau, he formed a post-rock group called My Violent Wish.

Career
2001–2005: First recordings
At 17, Gonzalez bought a synth to record a demo, which he sent to a number of French labels. When Paris-based Gooom Records seemed interested, he recruited Nicolas Fromageau to ""help me because I didn't feel like I had the shoulders to carry the project on my own"". They decided to name their band M83, after the galaxy of that name.
In spring 2001, while Gonzalez was still in college, M83 released its self-titled debut album recorded on an 8-track. It did not attract much attention outside Europe until September 2005, when Mute Records reissued it for worldwide release. M83's second album, Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, followed in spring 2003 (summer 2004 in North America) to widespread critical acclaim. After worldwide touring for Dead Cities resumed, Fromageau left the band; he later formed the band Team Ghost in 2009.
Gonzalez returned to the studio to record the group's third studio album, Before the Dawn Heals Us, released in January 2005. In 2016, the song ""Lower Your Eyelids to Die with the Sun"" was featured in the trailer for the film A Monster Calls starring Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver. Later in 2005, M83 provided a remix of ""The Pioneers"" by Bloc Party, which was also included on Bloc Party's remix album Silent Alarm Remixed. M83 also remixed Placebo's ""Protège-Moi"", Goldfrapp's ""Black Cherry"", Depeche Mode's ""Suffer Well"", Van She's ""Kelly"", and The Bumblebeez's ""Vila Attack"". Similarly, M83's songs have been remixed by Gooom labelmates Montag and Cyann & Ben.

2006–2009: Digital Shades Vol. 1 and Saturdays = Youth
In 2006, after the Before the Dawn Heals Us US tour, Anthony Gonzalez continued to explore a musical direction already heard on earlier M83 tracks and began writing and recording a collection of ambient works. The album was recorded primarily at his home studio with the assistance of Antoine Gaillet. The resulting project was called Digital Shades Vol. 1, and was released in September 2007 with a sleeve illustrated by Laurent Fetis (known for his work with DJ Hell, Beck, and Tahiti 80). It is intended to be part of an ongoing series of ambient works.
Saturdays = Youth, M83's fifth studio album, was released in April 2008. It was recorded with Ken Thomas (known for his work with Sigur Rós, The Sugarcubes, Boys in a Band, Cocteau Twins, and Suede), Ewan Pearson (who has also produced for Tracey Thorn, The Rapture and Ladytron) and Morgan Kibby (of The Romanovs). The album features a more focused approach to song structure and form, and Gonzalez stated that the main influence of the album came from music of the 1980s: ""I think that '80s music is such a brilliant period for music history. It was the occasion for me to do a tribute to this '80s music, but [it was] also a tribute to my teenage years because the main theme of the album is being a teenager, and being a teenager means a lot to me."" Four singles were released from the album: ""Couleurs"" in February 2008, ""Graveyard Girl"" in April, ""Kim & Jessie"" in July, and ""We Own the Sky"" in December. Redbull and Snowboarder Travis Rice used ""We Own the Sky"" as the opening song in the 2008 snowboard film That's It That's All. M83 also appeared on a limited edition split 7-inch single with Maps in 2008; M83 remixed Maps' ""To the Sky"", while Maps provided a remix of M83's ""We Own the Sky"".
In December 2008, M83 supported Kings of Leon on its UK tour. In January and February 2009, M83 supported The Killers across United States tour dates and toured with Depeche Mode on its Tour of the Universe in Italy, Germany, and France. In July, M83 appeared at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In July 2009, M83 appeared at the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio. Gonzalez, unprovoked, physically assaulted an elderly security guard when Gonzalez attempted to have members of the crowd join him on an unreinforced stage platform. The band later apologized to its fans for the incident. In 2010, on the eve of turning 30, Gonzalez moved to Los Angeles.

2010–2015: Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, Oblivion and commercial success
In Spring 2010, M83 composed the score of French director Gilles Marchand's film Black Heaven. On 5 July 2010, the Black Heaven Soundtrack was released, which included two new songs by M83 called ""Black Hole"" and ""Marion's Theme"", along with five tracks from his back catalog. The soundtrack also includes songs from the score by Emmanuel D'Orlando, Moon Dailly and John & Jehn. However, his feelings towards the record were largely negative, leaving him depressed.
In 2011, Gonzalez started working on a new batch of songs for an album slated for release later in the year. He described the tracks as darker and ""very, very, very epic"". Speaking with Spin, he said of the new album ""It's a double album. It's mainly about dreams, how every one is different, how you dream differently when you're a kid, a teenager, or an adult. I'm really proud of it. If you're doing a very long album, all the songs need to be different and I think I've done that with this one."" He recorded again with Morgan Kibby as well as others, including Medicine's mastermind Brad Laner, Nine Inch Nails bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen and Zola Jesus.
Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is Gonzalez's first double album, something he had dreamed of making ever since hearing The Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. ""I wanted to make a very eclectic album but also something not too long. Making a double album was a dream of mine for a long, long time and I felt ready to make this move,"" he explains. Discussing the sound and process of creating this album, Gonzalez says it was ""written like a soundtrack to an imaginary movie with different ambiances, different atmospheres, different tempos, different orchestrations and different instrumentation.... When I make an album it's always about nostalgia, melancholy in the past and memories.""
On 19 July 2011, the breakthrough single ""Midnight City"", the first from Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, was released for streaming and free download on the band's official website. Beginning in October, they toured North America and Europe to promote the album; Active Child supported the US leg of the tour. The album placed 3rd in Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2011 list; the single ""Midnight City"" was placed 1st on the Top 100 Tracks list. On 26 January 2012, M83 came in at number 5 on the Triple J Hottest 100 with the single ""Midnight City"". The track received further exposure in 2013 as the remixed soundtrack to the Gucci Premier fragrance television advert featuring Blake Lively. It was also used in the 2013 film Warm Bodies.
On 28 June 2012, it was announced that M83 would compose the soundtrack for the 2013 movie Oblivion, directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Tom Cruise. The score was co-written with Joseph Trapanese. The soundtrack album was released on 9 April 2013 by Back Lot Music featuring Susanne Sundfor on vocals. On 26 February 2014, a new song titled ""I Need You"" was included on the Divergent soundtrack. The song ""Wait"" was featured in the 2014 film The Fault in our Stars. It was also featured in the ""Perception"" episode of Revenge in 2012, ""The Backup Dan"" episode of Gossip Girl in 2012, ""Imperfect Circles"" episode of Under the Dome in 2013 and ""The World Has Turned and Left Me Here"" episode of The Vampire Diaries in 2014. More recently, ""Wait"" was used as part of the documentary ""The Day We Walked On The Moon"" commemorating the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing and screened in the UK by ITV in July 2019 and in the same year, in a feature film titled Five Feet Apart. Also from Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, two tracks, ""Another Wave from You"" and ""Outro"", featured in the 2014 remake of The Gambler. In 2015 and 2016, British-Franco-Canadian drama Versailles, uses ""Outro"" as the theme title. ""Outro"" was also featured in the popular snowboarding documentary The Art of Flight, in the reveal trailer for the games ""Paragon"" and ""Kerbal Space Program 2"", in a Mazda commercial entitled ""Feel Alive"" in 2018, and as the final song in the finale of both the USA Networks TV show Mr. Robot and Fox TV show Enlisted. Moonchild was featured in Top Gear's McLaren Mercedes SLR Oslo challenge. The Italian-French film Suburra from 2015 features music by M83 extensively.
In August 2014, the first three albums produced by the band were re-released by Mute Records with additional material available separately for download. Gonzalez justified the reissues by noting that physical copies of the albums were hard to find and sold for ""a ridiculous amount of money"". On 2 March 2015, M83, with indie pop group Haim, released the song ""Holes in the Sky"" from The Divergent Series: Insurgent soundtrack. He also participated in Jean-Michel Jarre's album Electronica 1: The Time Machine.

2016–present: Junk, Volta, Tour, DSVII, and Fantasy
On 1 March 2016, M83's seventh studio album Junk was announced along with its lead single, ""Do It, Try It"". The album was released on 8 April 2016. The band then embarked on a tour across North America and Europe during the first half of 2016. On 5 December 2016, it was announced that Gonzalez of M83 would be the composer and musical director for Cirque du Soleil's touring show, Volta.
In July 2019, Gonzalez announced M83's eighth studio album, DSVII (standing for Digital Shades, Vol. II). It was released on 20 September 2019. In December 2021, Gonzalez announced a re-release of Hurry Up We're Dreaming for its 10th anniversary. On 10 January 2023, M83 released the single ""Oceans Niagara"", and released their ninth studio album, Fantasy, on 17 March 2023. A tour of North America in support of the album followed.

Style
The band's aesthetic is characterized by dense guitar and synthesizer layering, extensive use of reverb effects, and lyrics often sung softly in a dream pop style. Gonzalez has been inspired by cultural and musical facets of the 1980s, and his songs have been described as ""adult-scripted teen dreams"". Inspiration for his music includes bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins, Depeche Mode, Jean-Michel Jarre, and Tangerine Dream.

Maarten van der Vleuten,"Maarten van der Vleuten (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmaːrtə(ɱ) vɑn dər ˈvløːtə(n)]) is a Dutch producer, composer and recording artist born in Vught, The Netherlands in 1967. Between 1987 and 2007 he used over two dozens of aliases, producing Detroit techno, electro, house, experimental and ambient music.
In early 2008 he announced that he would only use his real name for future releases. He recorded for R&S Records, Outrage Recordings, Apollo Records (Belgium), Djax-Up-Beats, See Saw, ESP and Klang Elektronik to name just a few.
Since 1996 he is also releasing music on his own label Signum Recordings (and its two sublabels Passiflora and Glam). Maarten's musical vision knows no limits: working in his own studio, he's constantly experimenting and exploring all aspects of (danceable) music, looking for innovation and bringing new angles to it. Due to his experimental vision towards his music, Van Der Vleuten's productions are not mainstream material. As a result of that he has gained more credits from within the ""underground"" scene. Or as the database of the Dutch Rock & Pop Institute writes; ""one of the pioneers of the dutch dance scene"".

Aliases
All known aliases in alphabetical order:
48V Phantom Power, Cliche, Cryptic, DJ Dusk, DJ G-Spot, Dutch Department Of Techno, E144, E414, Error 144, Error 441, Flash Back, Flux, Frantic, G.S.G, Gangrene, In-Existence, Integrity, Major Malfunction, N.Cantado, The Noise Architect, Orpheus, Party Marty, Pultec, V48, Vandervleuten, Zimt.

In-Existence
""In-Existence"" is the alias van der Vleuten uses for his ambient-related musical projects. In 1993 the debut album Moonwater by In-Existence was released on the ambient label Apollo Records (Belgium), a subsidiary of R&S Records. (Musically a mix between Detroit techno and ambient)
On Van Der Vleuten's own label Signum Recordings the follow-up was released 1998; Private Rituals. A mix of ambient, worldmusic and classical. Guest musicians that appear on the album are; Edwin Paanakker, Eddie Persijn, Frans Friedrich and Choir Jeroen Bosch. The album Vow of Silence, on Tonefloat, musically referred to the debut with ambient-techno influences.
The fourth album ...Of Truth, Eternal Beauty And Nought... again sounded familiar with the ambient-techno influences. The opening track Capezzoli Di Venere is a 45-minute, almost neo-romantic sounding piece of spacious sounds and rhythmic sequences which is quite a contradiction to the extremely dark final title I Have This Pain.
The tone has been set and the last In-Existence album De Verkenningen continues with dark, droned sounds. The last track on the album, Vierde Verkenning is used by Dutch contemporary artist Frank Havermans and can be heard inside the art-installation KAPKAR / TT-C2P. The installation is part of the exhibition Tangible Traces- Dutch Architecture and Design by Netherlands Architecture Instituut and will travel around the world for two years, opening at November 10, 2007, during the Seventh São Paulo Biennale of Architecture in Brazil. Up to now the exhibition travelled to Vienna (Austria) and Hong Kong.

Mannheim Steamroller,"Mannheim Steamroller is an American neoclassical new-age music ensemble founded and directed by percussionist/composer Chip Davis in 1974. The group is known primarily for its Fresh Aire series of albums, which blend classical music with elements of new age and rock, and for its modern recordings of Christmas music. The group has sold 28 million albums in the U.S. alone.

History
Beginnings
Mannheim Steamroller began as an alias for record producer and composer Chip Davis. The name ""Mannheim Steamroller"" comes from an 18th-century German musical technique, Mannheim roller (German: Mannheimer Walze), a crescendo passage having a rising melodic line over an ostinato bass line, popularized by the Mannheim school of composition.
Before the fame of Steamroller, Davis had been best known for collaborating with his friend Bill Fries on the songs of the country music character ""C. W. McCall"", of ""Convoy"" fame. The song was based on the character created by Fries and music composed by Davis for a series of Clio winning ads for Metz Baking Company for their Old Home Bread product. Davis was named 1976's Country Music Writer of the Year, a genre he is not fond of.
Even before the height of McCall's popularity, Davis produced an unusual album of classical music performed entirely by Davis and musical collaborator and keyboardist Jackson Berkey, using electric bass (played by Eric Hansen) and synthesizers.

Fresh Aire and American Gramaphone
Since no major label would handle the distribution of Fresh Aire, Davis founded his own music label, American Gramaphone (a play on the German classical record label Deutsche Grammophon), to release the album, which was published in 1975 under the pseudonym Mannheim Steamroller. Fresh Aire II was subsequently released in 1977, and Fresh Aire III was released in 1979. The first four Fresh Aire albums constituted an exploration of the four seasons, with Fresh Aire being spring, Fresh Aire II being fall, Fresh Aire III being summer, and Fresh Aire IV being winter. All four of these albums maintained the blend of baroque classical music, light jazz, and rock and featured Jackson Berkey's virtuosic keyboard work. Davis and Berkey used whatever instrument seemed appropriate to the piece, using a toy piano on one piece and a full pipe organ on another, with copious interleaving of piano and harpsichord. In 1981 Davis released Fresh Aire Interludes, an album that compiled Berkey's ten piano interludes from the first four Fresh Aire albums.
Davis then moved into exploring some other themes, with Fresh Aire V subtitled ""To the Moon"", Fresh Aire VI exploring Greek mythology, Fresh Aire 7 based on the number 7, and Fresh Aire 8 based on the theme of infinity. A live tour of the early albums featured a prominent light show and multimedia components, along with spoken poetry by Almeda Berkey. While the music was slightly different from the album versions, it was played in lockstep at each show, as it had to coordinate the live musicians with recorded tracks of strings and other orchestral parts.
In 1986, Mannheim Steamroller released music composed for a PBS special called Saving the Wildlife, which featured one track from Fresh Aire VI and twelve new tracks. In 1987, Davis collaborated with guitarist/composer Mason Williams for the album Classical Gas. The music was composed entirely by Williams but produced and arranged by Davis. The album opens with a remake of Williams' 1968 instrumental ""Classical Gas"", which used the original arrangement.

Christmas music success
Steamroller found its greatest fame beginning in 1984 when Davis released his first holiday album, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas, featuring modern contemporary interpretations of Yuletide favorites. This was followed by A Fresh Aire Christmas in 1988.
Steamroller's Christmas music caught the ear of conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh when it was used as bumper music for football games toward the end of the NFL season around the holidays. In turn, he began using it as bumper music on his radio show during the holiday season. As a result, Manheim Steamroller found a whole new audience among conservatives, and became one of the most requested Christmas music artists of all time.
Steamroller released Christmas in the Aire in 1995. Like its two predecessors, it showcased creative approaches to old carols, as well as some new carol-like compositions. At the end of 1997, they released a live album of Christmas music, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live. Their fourth all-new Christmas album, Christmas Extraordinaire, was released in 2001. While Steamroller's third and fourth Christmas releases sold well, they fell short of the sales of Christmas and A Fresh Aire Christmas. Christmas Celebration, a compilation of favorite tracks from the previous studio albums (with one new song), was released in 2004.
The studio album Christmas Song was released in late 2007 and features guest vocals by Johnny Mathis and Olivia Newton-John (on a remake of ""Christmas Lullaby"" from their third Christmas album). Steamroller co-founder Jackson Berkey is absent from the lineup. The CD Christmasville was released in 2008. Their next release was a 25th anniversary Christmas box set consisting of previously released material, and in 2011 they released Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Symphony with members of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.
Manheim Steamroller's top nine best selling albums are all Christmas albums.

Other work
Musically, as the 1990s progressed, Davis moved into the mainstream of ""progressive rock"" music with a heavier reliance on synthesized instruments and less humor. Titles like ""Small Wooden Bach'ses"" from Fresh Aire III were not seen, nor mechanisms like the creative use of a cricket on the same album or the Gregorian chant on Fresh Aire II. Davis's music became closer to the ""light jazz"" style that gained prominence in the 1990s, especially with the Day Parts albums.
Steamroller developed a full-length theatrical motion picture based on their Christmas albums, but the plans for production fell through. Instead, the following year, they collaborated with Olivia Newton-John for yet another Christmas album called The Christmas Angel: A Family Story, a mostly spoken-word recording scored with previously released material. In 2003 they released a CD titled Halloween.
In addition to their Fresh Aire and Christmas collections, Steamroller has released: an album of Disney music (1999's Mannheim Steamroller Meets the Mouse); an album celebrating American heritage, (2003's American Spirit, which reunited Davis with C.W. McCall and featured a remake of ""Convoy""); and an album Yellowstone, mixing prior Davis compositions and a series of classical pieces by Ottorino Respighi and others.
Mannheim Steamroller's An American Christmas is a 12-hour nationally broadcast special radio program of music and narrated stories, heard on over 250 stations across the United States. The program is hosted by Davis and is produced and distributed each year by WestStar TalkRadio Network.
In 2008, Davis underwent surgery, which prevented him from touring or performing with the band. Rather than ultimately force the tour to stop while he recovered, Davis opted to hire additional musicians to replace him temporarily. He also decided to create two different lineups of the band, nicknamed the ""red"" and ""green"" touring companies.
The group appeared in the 2011 and 2013 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, playing their version of ""Deck the Halls.""
A new album composed and performed in the design of the Fresh Aire series, Exotic Spaces, was set for release in March 2018. The album features songs that were inspired by famous – and exotic – sites, such as Egypt's pyramids and the Taj Mahal. Instrumentation comes from exotic and ethnic instruments mixed with the drums, harpsichord, and synthesizers. The album was officially released in September 2019, prior to the 2019 Christmas tour.

Marconi Union,"Marconi Union are an English ambient music band formed in Manchester in 2003 by Richard Talbot and Jamie Crossley. In 2011, their live keyboardist Duncan Meadows became a full time member.

History
Marconi Union formed in 2003, when Talbot and Crossley met while working in a Manchester record shop. They have a reputation for being somewhat elusive as they frequently refuse interview requests and show little interest in promoting themselves despite having attracted considerable critical acclaim. More recently they have given several online interviews and appeared in Electronic Sound Magazine. Their self-produced debut album, Under Wires and Searchlights, appeared in 2003 on the independent label Ochre Records. They were picked up by All Saints Records shortly after.
In 2005, they released  Distance which featured a darker, more electronic sound. The follow-up, A Lost Connection, was originally slated for release on All Saints, but the band became victims of label politics following its takeover by Warner Bros. Frustrated by the delays and with two full-length albums recorded and awaiting release, Talbot and Crossley launched their own digital label, MU Transmissions, which started to sell their music through their website. Starting in 2008, Marconi Union gave away 12 downloads on their website, each of which was available for one month only. The tracks were completely exclusive and included outtakes, unreleased tracks and alternate mixes. In 2009 these were released as the compilation album 13.  Also in 2009, Marconi Union released a new album, Tokyo on the German-based label Binemusic. According to press releases and reviews, the album was inspired by images of the Japanese city. In 2010, A Lost Connection was remastered and released on CD. In the same year, the group announced Duncan Meadows, their live keyboardist, had joined on a permanent basis.
In July 2011, a new album, Beautifully Falling Apart (Ambient Transmissions Vol:1) was released on Just Music. Musically this was a diversion from previous releases, being largely beatless and with a greater emphasis on texture. Despite this move away from the more commercial aspects of their earlier work, it was met with critical acclaim.
Different Colours is their first album featuring Meadows as a full-time member, and once again differed in approach and sound from its predecessors. This time, the focus was on tightly structured arrangements, assimilating ideas from jazz and soundtrack composers like Bernard Herrmann with the intention of producing a more soulful sound. Different Colours achieved greater commercial success than their previous releases, and featured in several best of the year lists. The long-running radio show Echoes named it CD of the month.
In September 2012, Marconi Union appeared at the annual Punkt! Festival in Kristiansand, Norway, at the invitation of Brian Eno. As per the Festivals format instead of performing a regular set they performed two live remixes, one of Cyclobe and the other of S.C.U.M.
Over a period of two years, predating the arrival of Meadows, Talbot and Crossley also collaborated with Jah Wobble; the results being released as the album Anomic in June 2013.
In 2015 a limited edition E.P. cassette titled Departures was released, which was later made available on major digital streaming platforms in 2020. 2016 saw the release of their next album Ghost Stations. In 2017 an expanded edition of the Tokyo album was released, entitled Tokyo+. Their next album was Dead Air released in 2019.
On 1 September 2021, the group announced the release of their new single, ""Strata"". This is the first single from their album Signals, released in November 2021.

""Weightless""
On 16 October 2011, Marconi Union released ""Weightless"", an 8-minute track in collaboration with Lyz Cooper, of the British Academy of Sound Therapy, and Radox Spa. The song features guitar, piano and manipulated field recordings. It is punctuated throughout by low tones that supposedly induce a trance-like state.
It was reported in a study conducted at the Sussex Innovation Centre in Brighton that listening to the track reduced anxiety of the patients by up to 65%, being 11% better at inducing relaxation than other relaxing music. In November 2011, Marconi Union were featured in Time magazine's list of Inventors of the Year for recording ""Weightless"", describing it as ""the world's most relaxing song"". In January 2017 it charted in the Billboard charts. Despite the success of Weightless, the band has shied away from playing it live, seeing it as a separate project, and has concentrated on playing new material and selections from their critically acclaimed back catalogue.

Other activities
Marconi Union has worked on several visual arts projects. In 2015 they created ""Weightless / Endless"", an online installation in association with the Marina Abramovic Institute and later that year provided the soundtrack to ""A Distant Light"", a large-scale installation shown in Oxford Street, London in association with the Selfridges department store. Amongst others they have remixed Max Richter, Digitonal and Vok and have been remixed by Biosphere, Steve Jansen (Japan) and others.

Max Richter,"Max Richter (; German: [ˈʁɪçtɐ]; born 22 March 1966) is a German-born British composer and pianist. He works within postminimalist and contemporary classical styles. Richter is classically trained, having graduated in composition from the University of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Music in London, and studied with Luciano Berio in Italy.
Richter arranges, performs, and composes music for stage, opera, ballet and screen. He has collaborated with other musicians, as well as with performance, installation and media artists. He has recorded eight solo albums, and his music is widely used in cinema, such as the score of Ari Folman's animated war film Waltz with Bashir (2008).
As of December 2019, Richter has passed one billion streams and one million album sales.

Early life and career
Richter was born in Hamelin, Lower Saxony, West Germany. He grew up in Bedford, England, United Kingdom, and his education was at Bedford Modern School and Mander College of Further Education. He studied composition and piano at the University of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Music, and with Luciano Berio in Florence. After finishing his studies, Richter co-founded the contemporary classical ensemble Piano Circus. He stayed with the group for ten years, commissioning and performing works by minimalist musicians such as Arvo Pärt, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Julia Wolfe, and Steve Reich. The ensemble was signed to Decca/Argo, producing five albums.
In 1996, Richter collaborated with Future Sound of London on their album Dead Cities, beginning as a pianist, but ultimately working on several tracks, as well as co-writing one track (titled Max). Richter worked with the band for two years, also contributing to the albums The Isness and The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness. In 2000, Richter worked with Mercury Prize winner Roni Size on the Reprazent album In the Møde. Richter produced Vashti Bunyan's 2005 album Lookaftering and Kelli Ali's 2008 album Rocking Horse.

Solo work
Richter's solo albums include:

Memoryhouse (2002)
Reviewed by Andy Gill as ""a landmark work of contemporary classical music"", Max Richter's solo debut Memoryhouse, an experimental album of ""documentary music"" recorded with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, explores real and imaginary stories and histories. Several of the tracks, such as ""Sarajevo"", ""November"", ""Arbenita"", and ""Last Days"", deal with the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict, while others are of childhood memories (e.g. ""Laika's Journey""). The music combines ambient sounds, voices (including that of John Cage), and poetry readings from the work of Marina Tsvetaeva. BBC Music described the album as ""a masterpiece in neoclassical composition."" Memoryhouse was first played live by Richter at the Barbican Centre on 24 January 2014 to coincide with a vinyl re-release of the album.

Pitchfork gave the re-release an 8.7 rating, commenting on its extensive influence:In 2002, Richter’s ability to weave subtle electronics against the grand BBC Philharmonic Orchestra helped suggest new possibilities and locate fresh audiences that composers such as Nico Muhly and Michał Jacaszek have since pursued. As you listen to new work by Julianna Barwick or Jóhann Jóhannsson, thank Richter; just as Sigur Rós did with its widescreen rock, Richter showed that crossover wasn't necessarily an artistic curse.

The Blue Notebooks (2004)
Chosen by The Guardian as one of the best classical works of the century, The Blue Notebooks, released in 2004, featured the actress Tilda Swinton reading from Kafka's The Blue Octavo Notebooks and the work of Czesław Miłosz. Richter has stated that The Blue Notebooks is a protest album about the Iraq War, as well as a meditation on his own troubled childhood. Pitchfork described the album as ""Not only one of the finest record of the last six months, but one of the most affecting and universal contemporary classical records in recent memory."" To mark the 10th anniversary of its release, Richter created a track-by-track commentary for Drowned in Sound, in which he described the album as a series of interconnected dreams and an exploration of the chasm between lived experience and imagination. The second track, ""On the Nature of Daylight"", is used in both the opening and closing sequences of the sci-fi film Arrival, and the soundtrack for Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. It is also used in episode 3 ""Long, Long Time"" of HBO series The Last of Us.
On the eve of its 2018 re-issue, marking the 15th anniversary of its release, Fact named the album ""one of the most iconic pieces of classical and protest music of the 21st century."" The re-release included a new cover design and several new tracks that were originally composed for the project. Richter also released another single, ""Cypher"", which is an 8 minutes classical-electronic track based upon the theme of ""On the Nature of Daylight"".

Songs from Before (2006)
In 2006, he released his third solo album, Songs from Before, which features Robert Wyatt reading texts by Haruki Murakami.

24 Postcards in Full Colour (2008)
Richter released his fourth solo album 24 Postcards in Full Colour, a collection of 24 classically composed miniatures for ringtones, in 2008. The pieces are a series of variations on the basic material, scored for strings, piano, and electronics.
Discussing the album with NPR Classical in 2017 Richter stated ""People were downloading ringtones at the time and I felt this was a missed opportunity for composers. That there was a space opening up, maybe a billion little loudspeakers walking around the planet, but nobody was really thinking of this as a space for creative music. So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then, of course, in the poetic sense, the idea of these little sounds carrying objects traversing the planet, I started to think of these as a connection, as a sort of postcard into somebody's life, into their space.""

Infra (2010)
Richter's 2010 album Infra takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London, and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House. Infra comprises music written for piano, electronics and string quintet, plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album.
Pitchfork described the album as ""achingly gorgeous"" and The Independent newspaper characterised it as ""a journey in 13 episodes, emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness.""

Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons (2012)
Richter's 'recomposed' version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons, was premiered in the UK at the Barbican Centre on 31 October 2012, performed by the Britten Sinfonia, conducted by André de Ridder and with violinist Daniel Hope. Although Richter said that he had discarded 75% of Vivaldi's original material, the parts he does use are phased and looped, emphasising his grounding in postmodern and minimalist music, and leading one critic to quip parenthetically, ""(Perhaps you could call Richter a baroque decomposer?)."" The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK, Germany and the US. The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed.

Sleep and  From Sleep (2015)
In 2015, Richter released his most ambitious project to date, a collaboration with visual artist, and creative partner, Yulia Mahr, titled Sleep, an 8.5 hour listening experience targeted to fit a full night's rest. The album itself contains 31 compositions, most of them reaching 20–30 minutes in duration, all based around variations of 4-5 themes. The music is calm, slow, mellow and composed for piano, cello, two violas, two violins, organ, soprano vocals, synthesisers and electronics. Strings are played by the American Contemporary Music Ensemble (Ben Russell, Yuki Numata Resnik, Caleb Burhans, Clarice Jensen and Brian Snow), vocals are by Grace Davidson, and the piano, synthesisers and electronics are played by Richter himself.
Richter also released a 1-hour version of the project, From Sleep, that contains roughly 1 shortened version of every ""theme"" from Sleep (hence its title), and is supposed to act as a shorter listening experience for the Sleep project.
Richter has described Sleep as an eight-hour-long lullaby. It was released on CD and vinyl. The work was strongly influenced by Gustav Mahler's symphonic works.
The entire composition was performed on 27 September 2015, from midnight to 8:00 A.M. as the climax of the ""Science and Music"" weekend on BBC Radio 3. The performance broke several records, including the longest live broadcast of a single musical composition in the history of the network.
Sleep was chosen by Jarvis Cocker to be the BBC Radio 6 Album of the year for 2015 and by Pitchfork as one of the 50 best ambient albums of all time.
The full-length Sleep has been played live by Richter at the Concertgebouw (Grote Zaal) Amsterdam; the Sydney Opera House; in Berlin (as part of Berliner Festspiele's Maerz Musik Festival), in Madrid (as part of Veranos de la Villa) and in London (at the Barbican). In November 2017,  Sleep was played at the Philharmonie de Paris.
Sleep was performed for its first outdoor performance and largest performance to-date in Los Angeles, CA on 27–28 July and 28–29 July 2018. The performance took place in Grand Park, opposite Los Angeles Music Center.  Each performance had 560 beds and was timed so the final movement, ""Dream 0 (till break of day)"" would occur at dawn.  Richter played with members of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble.
In September 2018 it was played in the Antwerp cathedral for an audience of 400 which were provided with beds for the night. In August 2019 it was performed in Helsinki, as part of the Helsinki Festival, in the tent arena, with half the audience in two-person tents.
""I think of it as a piece of protest music,"" Richter has said. ""It’s protest music against this sort of very super industrialised, intense, mechanised way of living right now. It’s a political work in that sense. It’s a call to arms to stop what we’re doing.

Three Worlds: Music from Woolf Works (2017)
Three Worlds: Music From Woolf Works is Max Richter’s eighth album, released in January 2017. The music is taken from the score Richter composed for the ballet Woolf Works in collaboration with choreographer Wayne McGregor at the Royal Opera House in London, which follows a three-part structure offering evocations of three books by Virginia Woolf (Mrs Dalloway, Orlando, and The Waves). The album features classical and electronic sound as well as an original voice recording of Woolf herself.

Voices (2020)
Richter's Voices project, a collaboration with visual artist Yulia Mahr, is inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and features an  'upside down' orchestra, a concept he developed to reflect his dismay of post-truth politics in the 21st century. The album contains readings of the declaration by Eleanor Roosevelt and actress Kiki Layne, with a further 70 readings crowd-sourced from around the world.
The accompanying music videos by Yulia Mahr dealt with the artist's own experiences of migration. The video 'Mercy' won a BAFTA award.
The opening piece on the album was played by Yo-Yo Ma at his concert ""A New Equilibrium"" honouring the 75th anniversary of the UN's creation.

Exiles (2021)
On 6 August 2021, the new album Exiles was released. The album was recorded in 2019, in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, with the collaboration of a conductor Kristjan Järvi and the Baltic Sea Philharmonic. The  Exiles also includes extended versions of previously released works such as ""The Haunted Ocean"", ""Infra 5"", ""Flowers Of Herself"", ""On The Nature Of Daylight"" and ""Sunlight"". Max Richter describes the Exile album as a serious work because of its theme of the subject, which has an emotional texture.

Film and television work
Richter has created numerous film and television soundtracks over the years. He rose to prominence with his score to Ari Folman's Golden Globe-winning film Waltz with Bashir in 2007, in which he supplanted a standard orchestral soundtrack with synth-based sounds and winning him the European Film Award for Best Composer. He also scored the independent feature film Henry May Long, starring Randy Sharp and Brian Barnhart, in 2008, and wrote the music for Feo Aladag's film Die Fremde (with additional music by Stéphane Moucha).
In 2010, Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter Earth"" was remixed with Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"" for the Martin Scorsese film Shutter Island. In July 2010, ""On the Nature of Daylight"" and ""Vladimir's Blues"" were featured throughout the BBC Two two-part drama Dive, which was co-written by BAFTA-winning Dominic Savage and Simon Stevens. ""On the Nature of Daylight"" was also featured in an episode of HBO's television series Luck. Four tracks—""Europe, After the Rain"", ""The Twins (Prague)"", ""Fragment"", and ""Embers""—were used in the six-part 2005 BBC documentary Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution produced by Laurence Rees. Richter also wrote the soundtrack to Peter Richardson's documentary, How to Die in Oregon, and the score to Impardonnables (2011) directed by André Téchiné.
An excerpt of the song ""Sarajevo"" from his 2002 album Memoryhouse was used in the international trailer for the Ridley Scott film Prometheus. The track ""November"", from the same album, was featured in the international trailer for Terrence Malick's 2012 film, To the Wonder, and in the trailer for Clint Eastwood's 2011 film, J. Edgar. Films featuring Richter's music released in 2011 include French drama Sarah's Key by Gilles Paquet-Brenner and David MacKenzie's romantic thriller Perfect Sense. In 2012 he composed the scores for Henry Alex Rubin's Disconnect and Cate Shortland's Australian-German war thriller Lore. Richter again collaborated with Folman on The Congress, which was released in 2013.
Richter composed the original soundtrack for the HBO series The Leftovers, created by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta, which was premiered in June 2014. Some of these compositions are included in the albums Memoryhouse and The Blue Notebooks. He also composed the score for the WW1 feature film Testament of Youth in 2014.
In 2016, Richter composed the score to ""Nosedive"", an episode of Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror. Also that year, he scored Luke Scott's debut feature Morgan and the political thriller Miss Sloane, while his piece ""On the Nature of Daylight"" opened and closed Denis Villeneuve's film Arrival. ""On the Nature Of Daylight"" also closes episode 7 of Castle Rock, ""The Queen"". He composed all the music in BBC One's drama Taboo which was broadcast in January and February 2017.
In 2017, The Current War used Richter's ""Spring 1"".
In 2017, documentary film maker Nancy Buirski used the track combining Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter Earth"" with Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"", first heard in Shutter Island, in her film The Rape of Recy Taylor.
In December 2017, an excerpt of Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons was used in The Crown season 2 as the theme for Princess Margaret's (Vanessa Kirby) turbulent courtship with photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones (Matthew Goode).
In 2018, Richter composed music for the films Hostiles by Scott Cooper starring Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike, White Boy Rick starring Matthew McConaughey, the German film Never Look Away, and Mary Queen of Scots starring Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. He also composed music for the mini-series My Brilliant Friend on HBO.
In 2019, Richter scored the film Ad Astra starring Brad Pitt with additional music by Nils Frahm and Lorne Balfe. An excerpt of his rendition of Dona nobis pacem was used for the fifth season of the BBC series Peaky Blinders created by Steven Knight.
In 2021, his piece ""On The Nature of Daylight"" was, yet again, used in a TV show The Handmaid's Tale for a scene in season 4, episode 9. Interestingly, three years earlier Elisabeth Moss, the lead actress of the show, starred in Richter's music video of the same piece. As a director of the episode, as well as the star, Moss specifically chose the piece.
In October 2021, Richter composed the original score for the Apple TV series Invasion.
In 2023 the track ""On The Nature of Daylight"" was featured in the third episode of the HBO series The Last of Us.

Ballet, opera and stage works
Richter wrote the score to Infra as part of a Royal Ballet-commissioned collaboration with choreographer Wayne McGregor and artist Julian Opie. The production was staged at the Royal Opera House in London in 2008. In 2011, Richter composed a chamber opera based on neuroscientist David Eagleman's book Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives. The opera was choreographed by Wayne McGregor and premiered at the Royal Opera House Linbury Studio Theatre in 2012. The piece received positive reviews, with London's Evening Standard saying ""[it] fits together rather beautifully"". Their collaboration continued in April 2014 with Wayne McGregor's 'Kairos'; a ballet set to Richter's recomposition of the Four Seasons and part of a collaborative program involving three different choreographers titled 'Notations' with Ballett Zürich. In 2015 Richter and McGregor collaborated again on a new full-length ballet, Woolf Works, inspired by three novels by Virginia Woolf.
Crystal Pite has also choreographed a ballet to Richter's Vivaldi Recomposed, titled The Seasons' Canon, which premiered at the Opera National de Paris in 2016. Sol Leon and Paul Lightfoot choreographed a piece to Richter's ""Exiles"" for the Nederlands Dans Theater.
In 2012/13, Richter contributed music to The National Theatre of Scotland's production of Macbeth, starring Alan Cumming. The play opened at New York's Lincoln Centre and subsequently moved to Broadway. The company had previously used Richter's ""Last Days"" in their acclaimed production of Black Watch.
Richter worked on a project based on Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings and Antonio Vivaldi's The Four Seasons and made a ballet with artist Idris Khan.
Richter was called upon again by past collaborator Wayne McGregor to score and produce an adaptation of Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam trilogy commissioned by the National Ballet of Canada and The Royal Ballet in 2022, wherein his orchestral and electronically produced compositions, both alone and together, help to realize Atwood's dystopian vision.

Other collaborations
In 2010, Richter's soundscape The Anthropocene formed part of Darren Almond's film installation at the White Cube gallery in London. The composer has also collaborated with digital art collective Random International on two projects, contributing scores to the installations Future Self (2012), staged at the MADE space in Berlin, and Rain Room (2012/13) at London's Barbican Centre and MOMA, in New York.

Personal life
Richter met visual artist Yulia Mahr at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988. They began living together, in Islington, London, in 1993 and went on to have three children, born in 1998, 1999 and 2008. They married in 2003 and celebrated with a garden party.
The couple lives in Oxfordshire and their three children, two black Labradors and a cat. They have previously also lived in Edinburgh and Berlin.

Michael Hedges,"Michael Alden Hedges (December 31, 1953 – December 2, 1997) was an American acoustic guitarist and songwriter.

Early years
The son of Thayne Alden Hedges and Ruth Evelyn Hedges Ipsen, Michael Hedges was born in Sacramento, California. His life in music began in Enid, Oklahoma, playing flute and guitar. He enrolled at Phillips University in Enid to study classical guitar and composition under E. J. Ulrich, who Hedges credited as his biggest influence from his academic training. Hedges studied as a composition major at Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland where he applied his classical  background to steel-string acoustic guitar, also studying electronic music.
Hedges made a living by playing and singing in bars and restaurants in Baltimore while a student at Peabody. From 1976 to 1977 he played electric guitar and flute for a local group called Lotus Band, which he left to start performing as a solo acoustic act. In 1980, he made plans to move to California to study music at Stanford University. Hedges was contacted in February 1981 by William Ackerman who heard him perform at the Varsity Theater in Palo Alto. On a napkin, Ackerman signed Hedges to a recording contract with Windham Hill Records.

Recordings
Hedges' first two albums for Windham Hill were Breakfast in the Field and Aerial Boundaries. He wrote nearly exclusively in alternate tunings. His early recordings and most of the Breakfast in the Field album were recorded on the Ken DuBourg guitar and his Martin D-28, named ""Barbara"". Some of the techniques he used include slap harmonics (created by slapping the strings over a harmonic node), use of right hand hammer-ons (particularly on bass notes), use of the left hand for melodic or rhythmic hammer-ons and pull offs, percussive, syncopated slapping on the guitar body, as well as unusual strumming. He made extensive use of string damping as employed in classical guitar, and was known to insist strongly on the precise duration of sounds and silences in his pieces. He played guitar variants like the harp guitar (an instrument with additional bass strings), and the TransTrem guitar. He was a multi-instrumentalist who played piano, percussion, tin whistle, harmonica, and flute. Bassist Michael Manring contributed to nearly all of Hedges' records.
Frustrated that his published work reflected only the instrumental side of his creative output, Hedges convinced Windham Hill to release Watching My Life Go By, a 1985 studio recording of his vocal originals written over a span of five years—songs often performed at his concerts leading up to the album's release. His fourth album, a live recording called Live on the Double Planet, was assembled from 40 of his live concerts from 1986 to 1987.
His musical education was largely in modern 20th-century composition. He listened to Martin Carthy, John Martyn, and the Beatles, but his approach to composition owed much to Igor Stravinsky, Edgard Varèse, Anton Webern, and Steve Reich, in addition to experimental composers such as Morton Feldman. He saw himself as a composer who played guitar, rather than a guitarist who composed music. He was often categorized as a new-age musician because of his association with Windham Hill.
Hedges toured briefly with Leo Kottke. These shows included solo performances by Kottke and Hedges and, as a finale, a number of duets including performances of Kottke's ""Doodles"" with Hedges playing a high-strung parlor guitar.
Hedges' Aerial Boundaries album, released in 1984, included a tribute piece to the works of acoustic guitarist Pierre Bensusan, simply entitled ""Bensusan"". Bensusan posthumously returned tribute on his 2001 release Intuite (""Favored Nations""), with a composition entitled ""So Long Michael"".

Personal life
Hedges was married to flautist Mindy Rosenfeld but the couple divorced in the late 1980s. He was the father of two children, Mischa Aaron Hedges and Jasper Alden Hedges.

Death
According to his manager Hilleary Burgess, Hedges was driving home from San Francisco International Airport after a visit to a girlfriend in Long Island, New York. His car apparently skidded off a rain-slicked S-curve and down a 120-foot (37 m) cliff. Hedges was thrown from his car and appeared to have died nearly instantly. His body was found a few days afterward. After his death, his album Oracle won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.
Hedges' unfinished last recordings were completed for the album Torched with the help of  Burgess and friends David Crosby and Graham Nash.

Guitars
Hedges regularly used the following instruments:

1971 Martin D-28 guitar (nicknamed ""Barbara"") with a combination of a Sunrise S-1 magnetic pickup and FRAP contact pickup under the treble strings
A 1978 Ken DuBourg custom made steel string guitar (stolen and returned many years later)
A custom 1980s Takamine guitar with his name on the headstock
Lowden L-25 guitars
Martin J-65M guitars
1920s Dyer harp guitar configured with a FRAP/autoharp pickup combo / reconfigured with Sunrise S-1 and two Barcus Berry magnetic pickups for the sub-basses (glued straight to the body)
Steve Klein electric harp guitar with a Steinberger TransTrem bridge
circa 1913 black Knutsen harp guitar (often incorrectly referred to as a Dyer) with a FRAP/autoharp pickup combo—and rattlesnake tail wedged under the sub-basses at the headstock
Custom Ervin Somogyi acoustic (as credited on Breakfast in the Field)

Michael Hedges Interview by Anil Prasad
Peabody Reports Michael's Death at the Wayback Machine (archived February 18, 1998)
Michael Hedges: Harp Guitar Player of the Month"
Michael Nyman,"Michael Laurence Nyman, CBE (born 23 March 1944) is an English composer, pianist, librettist, musicologist, and filmmaker. He is known for numerous film scores (many written during his lengthy collaboration with the filmmaker Peter Greenaway), and his multi-platinum soundtrack album to Jane Campion's The Piano. He has written a number of operas, including The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat; Letters, Riddles and Writs; Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs; Facing Goya; Man and Boy: Dada; Love Counts; and Sparkie: Cage and Beyond. He has written six concerti, five string quartets, and many other chamber works, many for his Michael Nyman Band. He is also a performing pianist. Nyman prefers to write opera over other forms of music.

Early life and education
Nyman was born in Stratford, London, to a family of secular Jewish furriers who immigrated from Poland.
Nyman was educated at the Sir George Monoux Grammar School, Walthamstow. He studied from 1961 until 1967 at King's College London, and at the Royal Academy of Music until 1967 with Alan Bush and Thurston Dart, focusing on piano and seventeenth-century baroque music. He won the Howard Carr Memorial Prize for composition in July 1964. In 1965–66 Nyman secured a residency in Romania to study folk-song, supported by a British Council bursary.

Career
Work as music critic, 1968–1976
Nyman says he discovered his aesthetic by playing the aria ""Madamina, il catalogo è questo"" from Mozart's Don Giovanni on his piano in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis, which ""dictated the dynamic, articulation and texture of everything I've subsequently done."" It subsequently became the base for his 1977 piece In Re Don Giovanni.
In 1969, Nyman provided the libretto of Harrison Birtwistle's opera Down by the Greenwood Side and directed the short film Love Love Love (based on the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love""). He then settled into music criticism, where he is generally acknowledged to have been the first to apply the term ""minimalism"" to music in a 1968 article in The Spectator magazine about the English composer Cornelius Cardew). He wrote introductions for George Frideric Handel's Concerti grossi, Op. 6, and interviewed George Brecht in 1976.. His 1976 album Decay Music was produced by Brian Eno. In 1974 Nyman published an influential book on experimental music called Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond, which explored the influence of John Cage on classical composers.

Founding of Campiello Band and collaboration with Peter Greenaway, 1976–1990
In the 1970s, Nyman was a member of the Portsmouth Sinfonia – the self-described World's Worst Orchestra. He was the featured pianist on the orchestra's recording of Bridge Over Troubled Water on the Martin Lewis-produced 20 Classic Rock Classics album, on which the Sinfonia gave their unique interpretations of the pop and rock repertoire of the 1950s–1970s. 
In 1976, he formed the Campiello Band, which became the Michael Nyman Band, for a production of Carlo Goldoni's Il Campiello. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, the band later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, three saxophones, trumpet, horn, bass trombone, bass guitar and piano. Many of Nyman's works are written for his ensemble, with the lineup variously altered and augmented.
One of his earliest film scores was the 1976 British sex comedy Keep It Up Downstairs, followed by numerous films, many of them European art films, including eleven directed by Peter Greenaway. Nyman drew frequently on early music sources in his scores for Greenaway's films: Henry Purcell in The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) (which included Memorial and Miserere Paraphrase), Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber in A Zed & Two Noughts (1985), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Drowning by Numbers (1988), and John Dowland in Prospero's Books (1991), largely at the request of the director. He wrote settings to various texts by Mozart for Letters, Riddles and Writs, part of Not Mozart. 
In 1987 Nyman composed the opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, for soprano, alto, tenor and instrumental ensemble (based on Nyman's score for the ballet La Princesse de Milan);  the opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), based on a case-study by Oliver Sacks; and five string quartets. 
He also recorded pop music with the Flying Lizards; a version of his Bird List from the soundtrack to Peter Greenaway's The Falls (1980) appears on their album Fourth Wall as ""Hands 2 Take"".

1990s
In 1990 he composed Ariel Songs for soprano and band; in 1993 MGV (Musique à Grande Vitesse)  for band and orchestra; concertos for saxophone, piano (based on The Piano score), violin, harpsichord, trombone, and saxophone & cello recorded by John Harle and Julian Lloyd Webber;
In 1991 Nyman composed The Michael Nyman Songbook based on poetry by Paul Celan, Arthur Rimbaud, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and William Shakespeare. His Six Celan Songs off this collection were composed for Ute Lemper, with whom he recorded the album. Ute Lemper also performed in the 1992 concert film of the same name, directed by Volker Schlöndorff.
In 1993, Nyman's popularity increased after he wrote the score to Jane Campion's award-winning 1993 film The Piano. The album became a classical music best-seller with over three million copies. His soundtrack won an Ivor Novello Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and American Film Institute award. He was nominated for a British Academy Award and a Golden Globe. 
He  produced a soundtrack for the silent film Man with a Movie Camera which largely reworked material he wrote for the soundtrack of the 1996 video game Enemy Zero. 

His forays into Hollywood were Gattaca (1997), Ravenous (1999) (with musician Damon Albarn), and The End of the Affair (1999). Gattaca was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music.
In 1999, Nyman created a group called Foster's Social Orchestra, which specialised in the work of Stephen Foster. One of their pieces appeared in the film Ravenous and an additional work, not used in the film, appeared on the soundtrack album.

21st century
In 2000, he produced an opera on the subject of cloning on a libretto by Victoria Hardie titled Facing Goya, an expansion of their one-act opera Vital Statistics. The lead, a widowed art banker, is written for contralto and the role was created by Hilary Summers. His newest operas are Man and Boy: Dada (2003) and Love Counts (2005), both on libretti by Michael Hastings.
From 2002–2005 he was a composer-in-residence at Badisches Staatstheater in Karlsruhe, Germany.
He composed the music for the children's television series Titch which is based on the books written and illustrated by Pat Hutchins.
On 7 July 2007, Nyman performed at Live Earth in Japan. Nyman began a long-term artistic collaboration with the filmmaker Max Pugh which resulted in many short art films, three experimental feature documentaries and a number of video installations. In 2008 Nyman realised, in collaboration with the cultural association Volumina, Sublime, an artist's book that unified his music with his passion for photography.
In October 2009, Nyman released The Glare, a collaborative collection of songs with David McAlmont. The album – recorded with the Michael Nyman Band – finds McAlmont putting lyrics based on contemporary news stories to 11 pieces of Nyman music drawn from different phases of his career. 
In 2012, he made a soundtrack for film, Everyday. Keith H. Yoo in 2012 commissioned Nyman to write a 26-minute piano quintet in four movements titled Through the Only Window. It premiered at the gala dinner for his father Yoo Byung-eun's photographic exhibition ""Through My Window"" in the Tuileries Garden of The Louvre in Paris on 25 June 2012. The work has been recorded by Nyman Quintet in the Abbey Road Studios, and has been released on Nyman's record label. In 2013 Nyman was again commissioned to compose a piece for Yoo Byung-eun's exhibition in the Orangerie Hall of the Palace of Versailles, and wrote the 32-minute-long symphony in four movements, Symphony No. 6 ""AHAE"", representing the four seasons in nature as depicted by Ahae, a pseudonym for Yoo Byung-eun. The London Symphony Orchestra premiered both pieces at L'Opéra of the Palace of Versailles in Paris on 8 September 2013 under the baton of the composer. They were also recorded.
In 2015 he performed in Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera at the Potemkin Stairs. The show was part of the 6th Odesa International Film Festival and gathered approximately 15,000 spectators.

Personal life
He was married to Aet Nyman (née Toome), with whom he has two daughters, Molly and Martha. His first string quartet quotes ""Unchained Melody"" in homage to Aet, who appears in Greenaway's The Falls, for which he also composed music. Molly is also a composer and in collaboration with Harry Escott has written several film scores, including for The Road to Guantanamo by her father's frequent collaborator Michael Winterbottom. Martha is a development researcher for the BBC.
In 2005, Nyman reported that he had been a supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C. for 33 years.

Honours
Nyman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.
Nyman was awarded an honorary doctorate (DLitt) from The University of Warwick on 30 January 2007. At the degree ceremony, The University of Warwick Brass Society and Chamber Choir, conducted by Paul McGrath, premiered a specially composed procession and recession fanfare by Nyman.
In 2015, he was awarded the Golden Duke for Lifetime Achievement, the special award of the 6th Odesa International Film Festival.

Works
Besides his compositions Nyman is also a filmmaker, having made over 80 films, his first shot in 1968.

Nyman's music re-used
Nyman's ""The Heart Asks Pleasure First"" (from The Piano) is the music on which Italian rock noir band Belladonna's song ""Let There Be Light"" is based. Released in December 2010, the track features Michael Nyman himself on piano.
Nyman's ""The Heart Asks Pleasure First"" (from The Piano) was used as backing music for one of the bank advertisements for Lloyds TSB broadcast on television. It has also been featured in episodes of 20/20.

Nyman's music for Peter Greenaway's films has been used in the Japanese television program Iron Chef.
Popular ""Chasing Sheep is Best Left to Shepherds"" (from The Draughtsman's Contract) constituted the main theme of Spanish TV program Queremos Saber, presented by Mercedes Milà in the nineties. In 2013, it was sampled in the Pet Shop Boys single ""Love Is a Bourgeois Construct"", produced by Stuart Price.
Nyman features in '9 Songs' (Michael Winterbottom, 2004) playing at the Hackney Empire on his 60th birthday.

Michael Shrieve,"Michael Shrieve (born July 6, 1949) is an American drummer, percussionist, and composer. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Santana, playing on the band's first seven albums from 1969 to 1974. At age 20, Shrieve was the second youngest musician to perform at Woodstock. His drum solo during ""Soul Sacrifice"" in the Woodstock film has been described as ""electrifying"", although he considers his solo during the same piece in 1970 at Tanglewood the superior performance.

History
Shrieve's first full-time band was called Glass Menagerie, followed by experience in the house band of an R&B club, backing touring musicians including B.B. King and Etta James. At 16, Shrieve played in a jam session at the Fillmore Auditorium, where he attracted the attention of Santana's manager, Stan Marcum. When he was 19, Shrieve jammed with Santana at a recording studio and was invited to join that day.
On August 16, 1969, Santana played the Woodstock Festival, shortly after Shrieve's twentieth birthday, but before the release of their eponymous first album (1969). He remained with Santana for Abraxas (1970), Santana III (1971), Caravanserai (1972), Welcome (1973), Borboletta (1974) and the live Lotus (1974). He co-wrote four of the tracks on Caravanserai, as well as co-produced the album.
Shrieve left the original Santana band to pursue solo projects. He moved to London to record the 1976 album Automatic Man with guitarist Pat Thrall, bass guitarist Doni Harvey and keyboardist Todd Cochran (billed as Bayete). While in London Shrieve was part of the fusion supergroup Go with Stomu Yamashta, Steve Winwood, Al Di Meola and Klaus Schulze, releasing two studio albums Go (1976) and Go Too (1977) and the live album Go Live from Paris (1976).
He played in the band Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve (with Sammy Hagar, Neal Schon, and Kenny Aaronson). Later, he played drums on (former Supertramp member) Roger Hodgson's first solo album, In the Eye of the Storm.
From 1979 to 1984, Shrieve collaborated as a percussionist in Richard Wahnfried, a side project of Klaus Schulze (another drummer turned electronic composer) while recording with Schulze his own first ""solo"" album of electronic music, Transfer Station Blue, in 1984.
Shrieve was also credited for playing percussion on the 1980 album Emotional Rescue by The Rolling Stones and in 1984, he played on Mick Jagger's She's the Boss album. When Jagger, Nile Rodgers and Shrieve were mixing the album at The Power Station in New York City, Jaco Pastorius invited Shrieve for a recording session downstairs. This recording remains unreleased.
In 1997, Shrieve joined former Santana musicians Neal Schon, Gregg Rolie, José ""Chepito"" Areas, Alphonso Johnson, and Michael Carabello to record Abraxas Pool.
Shrieve has also collaborated with David Beal, Andy Summers, Steve Roach, Jonas Hellborg, Buckethead, Douglas September, Freddie Hubbard and others. He has served as a session player on albums by Todd Rundgren and Jill Sobule.
In 2004, Michael appeared on the track ""The Modern Divide"" on the Revolution Void album Increase the Dosage. The album was released under a Creative Commons license.
As of April 2010, Shrieve lives in Seattle, Washington, where he plays in a fusion jazz group, Spellbinder, with Danny Godinez, Joe Doria, Raymond Larsen, and Farko Dosumov.
Shrieve has composed music for several films, most notably Paul Mazursky's Tempest and Apollo 13.
Shrieve currently plays a DW Collector's Series drum set and recently joined the Istanbul Agop cymbals family.  He's played a variety of other drum sets in the past as well including sets by Camco, Premier and most notably, Ludwig, as seen in the Woodstock footage.  He also played both Zildjian and later Paiste cymbals in his early days before becoming a long time Sabian user.

Honors
In 1998 Shrieve was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for his work with Santana.
In March 2011, Rolling Stone Magazine Readers picked The Best Drummers of All Time: Shrieve ranked #10.

Michael Shrieve Biography
2013 Audio Interview with Michael Shrieve from the podcast ""I'd Hit That""
Interview on Rundgren Radio April 6, 2010"
Michael Stearns,"Michael Stearns (born October 16, 1948) is an American musician and composer of ambient music. He is also known as a film composer, sound designer and soundtrack producer for large format films, theatrical films, documentaries, commercials, and themed attractions.

Biography
Growing up in Tucson, Arizona, Stearns started practicing guitar at 13. At 16, he played in a surf music band, sometimes backing artists such as The Lovin' Spoonful and Paul Revere & the Raiders.  Evolving to acid rock, he began composing music on multiple instruments in 1968 and, while in university and in the Air Force, spent a few years studying electronic music synthesis, the physics of musical instruments, and accumulating equipment (musical instruments, tape recorders...) for his first studio.
The studio opened in Tucson, Arizona in 1972 where he produced jingles and commercials for local radio and television, and nationally released jingles for Schlitz Beer and Greyhound Bus Lines. Stearns's interest in experimental ""space"" music though left him unsatisfied, as he found no audience to play his musical ideas, which could be at this time only related to the drug experience. After three years, Stearns underwent a spiritual crisis and thought about abandoning his career as a musician.
In 1975, Stearns met Emilie Conrad and Gary ""Da'oud"" David. Emily Conrad ran meditation classes in a workshop named Continuum, with Gary David performing on a Minimoog and looped tapes during the classes. Stearns and his girlfriend Susan Harper moved in Los Angeles, California, to join Emily Conrad, and Michael Stearns became a resident musician and composer until 1981. He developed then on synthesizers musical ideas that would feed his first solo albums.
By 1977, Stearns had formed a small independent record label (Continuum Montage) with Susan Harper and a close friend and investor, David Breuer. The same year came the first releases on tape, Desert Moon Walk and Sustaining Cylinders, followed by Ancient Leaves, his first album released on LP, in 1978.
In the same years, Stearns started out playing with Fred Stofflet a percussionist, then with Don Preston, the former keyboardist for The Mothers of Invention. Both of them were playing for Emily David's classes. After that, Stearns, Stofflet and Craig Hundley, a friend of Gary David's, started a free jazz group called ""Alivity"". Kevin Braheny came to one of their concerts and became friends with Stearns. He later joined Stearns to play live for Continuum, bringing his Serge synthesizer with him, on which Stearns would record his album Morning Jewel in 1979 before building his own Serge synthesizer. In the same period, Stearns started working with Craig Huxley scoring movies and developed a friendship with Stephen Hill.
In 1981, Continuum moved to a new location and Stearns began a solo career. He put together some ideas he performed live during the workshops on his Serge and came to his classic Planetary Unfolding. Ideas of the same kind were put together to form the album Light Play in 1983 and the track ""Return"" on the album Lyra.
Stearns signed on the label Sonic Atmospheres in 1984, on which some of his earlier works would be re-released (Light Play became M'Ocean in 1984, Morning Jewel became Jewel in 1985, and Planetary Unfolding was given a new release in 1985). In 1984, Chronos was the first film music done entirely by Stearns after years of collaboration with Huxley or Maurice Jarre. In 1986, he provided ""electronic images and textures"" for Constance Demby's album Novus Magnificat. After two more releases for Sonic Atmospheres, Plunge (1986) and Floating Whispers (1987), Stearns signed to Stephen Hill's new label Hearts of Space Records and released Encounter.
In the next years, Stearns worked again with Ron Fricke, scoring Baraka, his best-known composition, and released several albums, working with Steve Roach, Kevin Braheny and/or Ron Sunsinger (1989 : Desert Solitaire, 1994 : Singing Stones and Kiva) or alone (1993 : Sacred Sites, 1995 : The Lost World).
In 2000 and 2001, Stearns, now established in Santa Fe, New Mexico, released several albums on his own label Earth Turtle : Within, The Middle of Time, Spirits of the Voyage, The Storm, and Sorcerer. Stearns was involved in the music for the film Samsara which premiered in 2011.
In 2020, Stearns scored the music for the movie Switzerlanders.
He also released 2 albums, Convergence with Erik Wøllo in 2020 and Beyond Space And Time with Steve Roach in 2021.

Instruments
In his earlier albums, he often used the Serge Modular synthesizer, giving his music a twinkling and ""cosmic"" sound. In 1982, he built ""The Beam"", a 12-foot-long (3.7 m) acoustic instrument strung with 24 piano strings, designed by Jonathan W. Lazell and built with the help of Paul Abell. He has since used it in many albums (solo or collaboration) as well as in concert and film scores. At the end of the eighties, his sound became deeper and closer to Steve Roach's style. Michael Stearns' music is always very ambient and woven with sounds of nature or human voices. But it can also be more melodic with great themes evoking wide spaces or great landscapes.

Mike Oldfield,"Michael Gordon Oldfield (born 15 May 1953) is an English musician, songwriter, and producer best known for his debut studio album Tubular Bells (1973), which became an unexpected critical and commercial success. Though primarily a guitarist, Oldfield plays a range of instruments, which includes keyboards and percussion, as well as vocals. He has adopted a range of musical styles throughout his career, including progressive rock, world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient, and new age music.
Oldfield took up the guitar at age ten and left school in his teens to embark on a music career. From 1967 to 1970, he and his sister Sally Oldfield were a folk duo the Sallyangie, after which he performed with Kevin Ayers. In 1971, Oldfield started work on Tubular Bells which caught the attention of Richard Branson, who agreed to release it on his new label, Virgin Records. Its opening was used in the horror film The Exorcist and the album went on to sell over 2.7 million copies in the UK. Oldfield followed it with Hergest Ridge (1974), Ommadawn (1975), and Incantations (1978), all of which feature longform and mostly instrumental pieces.
In the late 1970s, Oldfield began to tour and release more commercial and song-based music, beginning with Platinum (1979), QE2 (1980), and Five Miles Out (1982). His most successful album of this period was Crises (1983), which features the worldwide hit single ""Moonlight Shadow"" with vocalist Maggie Reilly. After signing with WEA in the early 1990s, Oldfield's most significant album of the decade was Tubular Bells II (1992) and he experimented with virtual reality and gaming content with his MusicVR project. In 2012, he performed at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games held in London. Oldfield's discography includes 26 studio albums, nine of which have reached the UK top-ten. His final album, Return to Ommadawn was released in 2017. Oldfield's label announced his retirement in 2023.

Early life
Childhood
Oldfield was born on 15 May 1953 in Reading, Berkshire, to Raymond Henry Oldfield (1923–2016), an English general practitioner, and Maureen (née Liston), an Irish nurse. 
His mother, originally from Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, emigrated to England to enter the nursing profession. He has two elder siblings, sister Sally and brother Terence. When Oldfield was seven, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, David, who had Down syndrome and died in infancy. His mother was prescribed barbiturates, to which she became addicted. She had mental health problems and would spend much of the rest of her life in mental institutions, dying in early 1975, shortly after Oldfield had started writing Ommadawn.
His childhood was a complex blend of solitary interests and familial challenges, all under the roof of his family home at 35 Western Elms Avenue in Reading. Oldfield's early years were marked by his mother's recurring health issues, which cast a shadow over the family. Amidst this, there were brief moments of joy, such as when his father gifted him a Bob Dylan album, sparking an interest in music. However, the family also faced tragedy with the birth of Oldfield's brother David, who had Down syndrome and a heart condition, leading to a short and hidden life away from the family.
Music became a solace and a point of connection for Oldfield. He was introduced to the guitar by his sister Sally's boyfriend, and his fascination with the instrument grew. Every Christmas, his father would play a guitar that knew only three chords, igniting Oldfield's passion for the instrument. He also found an affinity for the piano, tinkering and creating tunes on a small, white grand piano in their living room.
Sally's record player was a gateway to the modern music world for Oldfield, where he discovered the sounds of Elvis and bands including the Shadows. Despite these musical influences, Oldfield often felt isolated, a feeling that was exacerbated by his experiences at a Catholic convent school, St Joseph’s on Upper Redlands Road, where he felt like a fish out of water.
At Western Elms Avenue, the attic workshop was a haven for young Oldfield, where he and his father bonded over building model aeroplanes. This shared activity was a respite from his usual solitude and an early indicator of his meticulous nature. Oldfield’s adventurous spirit was evident in his homemade parachute jump off the roof, a testament to his fearless character.
Despite the idyllic setting, life at Western Elms Avenue had its share of childhood antics and learning experiences. Oldfield would lay pennies on the nearby railway to be flattened by passing trains, a simple pleasure that brought him a sense of wonder. He also built a camp by the railway with friends, which was destroyed by other boys, an incident that stayed with him over the years.
A poignant memory from this period was the golf club incident at Western Elms Avenue, where a well-intended swing during a playful moment resulted in an accident with a young friend, an event that led to a lasting estrangement.
Oldfield’s education continued at a junior school called Highlands, which was a gentler environment compared to St Joseph’s. It was here, amidst the natural setting, that he could enjoy lessons outdoors and where his creativity was nurtured. Church visits introduced him to the solemn beauty of Latin mass music, which he appreciated despite the sense of obligation that accompanied these family outings.
The social isolation Oldfield felt was a constant thread throughout his youth. His mother, in an attempt to integrate him with his peers, would organize birthday parties. Yet, these events only highlighted his discomfort as he felt disconnected from the other children. The isolation was further compounded by a significant age gap between Oldfield and his siblings, which left him feeling distant from family play.
Through the blend of music, ingenuity, and the challenges of growing up at Western Elms Avenue, Oldfield's childhood laid the foundations for the introspective and innovative artist he would become.

Teenage years
Oldfield attended Highlands Junior School, St. Edward's Preparatory School (still located in Tilehurst Road) and Presentation College (Bath Road), all in Reading. When he was thirteen, the family moved to Harold Wood, then in Essex, and Oldfield attended Hornchurch Grammar School where, having already displayed musical talent, he earned one GCE qualification in English.
Oldfield took up the guitar aged ten, first learning on a 6-string acoustic instrument which his father had given to him. He learned technique by copying parts from songs, by folk guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, that he played on a portable record player. He tried to learn musical notation but was a ""very, very slow"" learner, saying: ""If I have to, I can write things down. But I don't like to."" By the time he was 12, Oldfield played the electric guitar and performed in local folk and youth clubs and dances, earning as much as £4 (equivalent to £82 in 2021) per gig. During a six-month break from music that Oldfield had around this time, he took up painting. In May 1968, when Oldfield turned fifteen, his school headmaster requested that he cut his long hair. Oldfield refused and left abruptly. He then decided to pursue music on a full-time, professional basis.

Career
1968–1972: Early career
After leaving school Oldfield accepted an invitation from his sister Sally to form a folk duo the Sallyangie, taking its name from her name and Oldfield's favourite Jansch tune, ""Angie"". They toured England and Paris and struck a deal with Transatlantic Records, for which they recorded one album, Children of the Sun (1969). After they split in the following year Oldfield had a nervous breakdown. He auditioned as bassist for Family in 1969 following the departure of Ric Grech, but the group did not share Roger Chapman's enthusiasm towards Oldfield's performance. Oldfield spent much of the next year living off his father and performing in an electric rock band named Barefoot that included his brother Terry on flute, until the group disbanded in early 1970.
In February 1970, Oldfield auditioned as the bassist in the Whole World, a new backing band that former Soft Machine vocalist Kevin Ayers was putting together. He landed the position despite the bass being a new instrument for him, but he also played occasional lead guitar and later looked back on this time as providing valuable training on the bass. Oldfield went on to play on Ayers's albums Shooting at the Moon (1970) and Whatevershebringswesing (1971), and played mandolin on Edgar Broughton Band (1971). All three albums were recorded at Abbey Road Studios, where Oldfield familiarised himself with a variety of instruments, such as orchestral percussion, piano, Mellotron, and harpsichord, and started to write and put down musical ideas of his own. While doing so Oldfield took up work as a reserve guitarist in a stage production of Hair at the Shaftesbury Theatre, where he played and gigged with Alex Harvey. After ten performances Oldfield grew bored of the job and was fired after he decided to play his part for ""Let the Sunshine In"" in 7/8 time.

1971–1991: Virgin years
Tubular Bells
By mid-1971, Oldfield had assembled a demo tape containing sections of a longform instrumental piece initially titled ""Opus One"". Attempts to secure a recording deal to record it professionally came to nothing. In September 1971, Oldfield, now a session musician and bassist for the Arthur Louis Band, attended recording sessions at The Manor Studio at Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, owned by businessman Richard Branson and run by engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth. Branson already had several business ventures and was about to launch Virgin Records with Simon Draper. Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demos and took them to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week of recording time at The Manor, after which Oldfield had completed what became ""Part One"" of his composition, Tubular Bells. He recorded ""Part Two"" from February to April 1973. Branson agreed to release Tubular Bells as the first record on the Virgin label and secured Oldfield a six-album deal with an additional four albums as optional.
Tubular Bells was released on 25 May 1973. Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the multi-layered recording, and its style moved through diverse musical genres. Its 2,760,000 UK sales puts it at No. 42 on the list of the best-selling albums in the country. The title track became a top-10 hit single in the US after the opening was used in the film The Exorcist in 1973. It is today considered to be a forerunner of the new-age music movement.

Hergest Ridge to Incantations
In 1974, Oldfield played the guitar on the critically acclaimed album Rock Bottom by Robert Wyatt.
In late 1974, his follow-up LP, Hergest Ridge, was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by Tubular Bells. Although Hergest Ridge was released over a year after Tubular Bells, it reached No. 1 first. Tubular Bells spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No. 2 before its one week at the top. Like Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's Herefordshire country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering world music piece Ommadawn released after the death of his mother, Maureen.
In 1975, Oldfield recorded a version of the Christmas piece ""In Dulci Jubilo"" which charted at No. 4 in the UK.
In 1975, Oldfield received a Grammy award for Best Instrumental Composition in ""Tubular Bells – Theme from The Exorcist"".
In 1976, Oldfield and his sister joined his friend and band member Pekka Pohjola to play on his album Mathematician's Air Display, which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's Througham Slad Manor in Gloucestershire by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay. Oldfield's 1976 rendition of ""Portsmouth"" remains his best-performing single on the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 3.
Oldfield recorded the double album Incantations between December 1977 and September 1978. This introduced more diverse choral performances from Sally Oldfield, Maddy Prior, and the Queen's College Girls Choir. When it was released on 1 December 1978, the album went to No. 14 in the UK and reached platinum certification for 300,000 copies sold.
In 1979, Oldfield supported Incantations with a European tour that spanned 21 dates between March and May 1979. The tour was documented with the live album and concert film, Exposed. Initially marketed as a limited pressing of 100,000 copies, the strength of sales for the album were strong enough for Virgin to abandon the idea shortly after, transferring it to regular production. During the tour Oldfield released the disco-influenced non-album single ""Guilty"", for which he went to New York City to find the best session musicians and write a song with them in mind. He wrote a chord chart for the song and presented it to the group, who completed it in the studio. Released in April 1979, the song went to No. 22 in the UK and Oldfield performed the song on the national television show Top of the Pops.
Oldfield's music was used for the score of The Space Movie (1980), a Virgin Films production that celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. In 1979, he recorded a version of the signature tune for the BBC children's television programme Blue Peter, which was used by the show for 10 years.

Platinum to Heaven's Open
Oldfield's fifth album, Platinum, was released in November 1979 and marked the start of his transition from long compositions towards mainstream and pop music. Oldfield performed across Europe between April and December 1980 with the In Concert 1980 tour.
In 1980, Oldfield released QE2, named after the ocean liner, which features a variety of guest musicians including Phil Collins on drums. This was followed by the European Adventure Tour 1981, during which Oldfield accepted an invitation to perform at a free concert celebrating the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in Guildhall. He wrote a new track, ""Royal Wedding Anthem"", for the occasion.
His next album, Five Miles Out, followed in March 1982, with the 24-minute track ""Taurus II"" occupying the whole of side one. The Five Miles Out World Tour 1982 saw Oldfield perform from April to December of that year. Crises saw Oldfield continue the pattern of one long composition with shorter songs. The first single from the album, ""Moonlight Shadow"", with Maggie Reilly on vocals, became Oldfield's most successful single, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 1 in nine other countries. The subsequent Crises Tour in 1983 concluded with a concert at Wembley Arena to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Tubular Bells. The next album, Discovery, continues with this trend, being the first single ""To France"" and subsequent Discovery Tour 1984.
Oldfield later turned to film and video, writing the score for Roland Joffé's acclaimed film The Killing Fields and producing substantial video footage for his album Islands. Islands continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, ""Islands"", sung by Bonnie Tyler and ""Magic Touch"", with vocals by Max Bacon (in the US version) and Glasgow vocalist Jim Price (Southside Jimmy) in the rest of the world, were the major hits. In the US ""Magic Touch"" reached the top 10 on the Billboard album rock charts in 1988. During the 1980s, Oldfield's then-wife, Norwegian singer Anita Hegerland, contributed vocals to many songs including ""Pictures in the Dark"".
Released in July 1989, Earth Moving features seven vocalists across the album's nine tracks. It is Oldfield's first to consist solely of rock and pop songs, several of which were released as singles: ""Innocent"" and ""Holy"" in Europe, and ""Hostage"" in the US.
For his next instrumental album, Virgin insisted that Oldfield use the title Tubular Bells 2. Oldfield's rebellious response was Amarok, an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes, unpredictable bursts of noise and a hidden Morse code insult, stating ""Fuck off RB"", allegedly directed at Branson. Oldfield did everything in his power to make it impossible to make extracts and Virgin returned the favour by barely promoting the album.
in February 1991, Oldfield released his final album for Virgin, Heaven's Open, under the name ""Michael Oldfield"". It marks the first time he handles all lead vocals. In 2013, Oldfield invited Branson to the opening of St. Andrew's International School of The Bahamas, where two of Oldfield's children were pupils. This was the occasion of the debut of Tubular Bells for Schools, a piano solo adaptation of Oldfield's work.

1992–2003: Warner years
By early 1992, Oldfield had secured Clive Banks as his new manager and had several record label owners listen to his demo of Tubular Bells II at his house. Oldfield signed with Rob Dickins of WEA Warner and recorded the album with Trevor Horn as producer. Released in August 1992, the album went to No. 1 in the UK. Its live premiere followed on 4 September at Edinburgh Castle which was released on home video as Tubular Bells II Live. Oldfield supported the album with his Tubular Bells II 20th Anniversary Tour in 1992 and 1993, his first concert tour since 1984. By April 1993, the album had sold over three million copies worldwide.
Oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles, with The Songs of Distant Earth (based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name) exhibiting a softer new-age sound. In 1994, he also had an asteroid, 5656 Oldfield, named after him.
In 1995, Oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles by producing the Celtic-themed album Voyager. In 1992, Oldfield met Luar na Lubre, a Galician Celtic-folk band (from A Coruña, Spain), with the singer Rosa Cedrón. The band's popularity grew after Oldfield covered their song ""O son do ar"" (""The sound of the air"") on his Voyager album.
In 1998, Oldfield produced the third Tubular Bells album (also premiered at a concert, this time in Horse Guards Parade, London), drawing on the dance music scene at his then new home on the island of Ibiza. This album was inspired by themes from Tubular Bells, but differed in lacking a clear two-part structure.
During 1999, Oldfield released two albums. The first, Guitars, used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, The Millennium Bell, consisted of pastiches of a number of styles of music that represented various historical periods over the past millennium. The work was performed live in Berlin for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999–2000.
He added to his repertoire the MusicVR project, combining his music with a virtual reality-based computer game. His first work on this project is Tres Lunas launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the game.
In 2002 and 2003, Oldfield re-recorded Tubular Bells using modern equipment to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original. He had wanted to do it years before but his contract with Virgin kept him from doing so. This new version featured John Cleese as the Master of Ceremonies, as Viv Stanshall, who spoke on the original, died in the interim. Tubular Bells 2003 was released in May 2003.

2004–present: Mercury years
On 12 April 2004, Oldfield launched his next virtual reality project, Maestro, which contains music from the Tubular Bells 2003 album and some new chillout melodies. The games have since been made available free of charge on Tubular.net.
In 2005, Oldfield signed a deal with Mercury Records UK, who secured the rights to his catalogue when the rights had reverted to himself. Mercury acquired the rights to Oldfield's back catalogue, in July 2007. Oldfield released his first album on the Mercury label, Light + Shade, in September 2005. It is a double album of music of contrasting mood: relaxed (Light) and upbeat and moody (Shade). In 2006 and 2007, Oldfield headlined the Night of the Proms tour, consisting of 21 concerts across Europe. Also in 2007, Oldfield released his autobiography, Changeling.
In March 2008, Oldfield released his first classical album, Music of the Spheres; Karl Jenkins assisted with the orchestration. In the first week of release the album topped the UK Classical chart and reached No. 9 on the main UK Album Chart. A single ""Spheres"", featuring a demo version of pieces from the album, was released digitally. The album was nominated for a Classical Brit Award, the NS&I Best Album of 2009.
In 2008, when Oldfield's original 35-year deal with Virgin Records ended, the rights to Tubular Bells and his other Virgin releases were returned to him, and were then transferred to Mercury Records. Mercury announced that his Virgin albums would be reissued with bonus content from 2009. In 2009, Mercury released the compilation album The Mike Oldfield Collection 1974–1983, that went to No. 11 in the UK chart.
In 2008, Oldfield contributed a new track, ""Song for Survival"", to the charity album Songs for Survival in support of Survival International. Oldfield's daughter Molly played a large part in the project. In 2010, lyricist Don Black said that he had been working with Oldfield. In 2012, Oldfield was featured on Journey into Space, an album by his brother Terry, and on the track ""Islanders"" by German producer Torsten Stenzel's York project. In 2013, Oldfield and York released a remix album entitled Tubular Beats.
Oldfield performed live at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London. His set included renditions of Tubular Bells, ""Far Above the Clouds"" and ""In Dulci Jubilo"" during a segment about the National Health Service. This track appears on the officially released soundtrack album Isles of Wonder. Later in 2012, the compilation album Two Sides: The Very Best of Mike Oldfield was released and reached No. 6 in the UK.
In October 2013, the BBC broadcast Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story, a documentary on Oldfield's life and career. Oldfield's rock-themed album of songs, titled Man on the Rocks, was released on 3 March 2014 by Virgin EMI. The album was produced by Steve Lipson. The album marked a return of Oldfield to a Virgin branded label, through the merger of Mercury Records UK and Virgin Records after Universal Music's purchase of EMI. The track ""Nuclear"" was used for the E3 trailer of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.
In 2015, Oldfield told Steve Wright on his BBC radio show that a sequel album to Tubular Bells was in early development, which he aimed to record on analogue equipment. Later in 2015, Oldfield revealed that he had started on a sequel to Ommadawn. The album, named Return to Ommadawn, was finished in 2016 and released in January 2017. It went to No. 4 in the UK. Oldfield again hinted at a fourth Tubular Bells album when he posted photos of his new equipment, including a new Telecaster guitar.
A 50th anniversary edition of Tubular Bells was released on 26 May 2023. It features a new master of the original album along with an additional previously unreleased 8 minute track, the ""Introduction to Tubular Bells 4"". ""Introduction to Tubular Bells 4"" was recorded by Oldfield as a demo in 2017, and his record label has indicated that he decided not to go forward with the Tubular Bells 4 project, and that this ""may well be the last piece ever to be recorded by Oldfield"".

Musicianship
Oldfield's 1970s recordings were characterised by a very broad variety of instrumentation predominantly played by himself, plus assorted guitar sound treatments to suggest other instrumental timbres (such as the ""bagpipe"", ""mandolin"", ""Glorfindel"" and varispeed guitars on the original Tubular Bells).
During the 1980s Oldfield became expert in the use of digital synthesizers and sequencers (notably the Fairlight CMI) which began to dominate the sound of his recordings: from the late 1990s onwards, he became a keen user of software synthesizers. He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's Amarok, 1996's Voyager and 1999's Guitars).
While generally preferring the sound of guest vocalists, Oldfield has frequently sung both lead and backup parts for his songs and compositions. He has also contributed experimental vocal effects such as fake choirs and the notorious ""Piltdown Man"" impression on Tubular Bells.

Guitars
Over the years, Oldfield has used a range of guitars. Among the more notable of these are:

1963 Fender Stratocaster
Serial no. L08044, in salmon pink (fiesta red). Used by Oldfield from 1984 (the Discovery album) until 2006 (Night of the Proms, rehearsals in Antwerp). Subsequently, sold for £30,000 at Chandler Guitars.
1989 PRS Artist Custom 24
In amber, used by Oldfield from the late 1980s to the present day.
1966 Fender Telecaster
Serial no. 180728, in blonde. Previously owned by Marc Bolan, this was the only electric guitar used on Tubular Bells. The guitar was unsold at auction by Bonhams in 2007, 2008 and 2009 at estimated values of, respectively, £25,000–35,000, £10,000–15,000 and £8,000–12,000; Oldfield has since sold it and donated the £6500 received to the charity SANE.
Various Gibson Les Paul, Zemaitis and SG guitars
Used extensively by Oldfield in the 1970s and 80s. The most notable Gibson guitar Oldfield favoured in this time period was a 1962 Les Paul/SG Junior model, which was his primary guitar for the recording of Ommadawn, among other works. Oldfield is also known to have owned and used an L6-S during that model's production run in the mid-1970s. On occasion, Oldfield was also seen playing a black Les Paul Custom, an early reissue model built around 1968.
Oldfield used a modified Roland GP8 effects processor in conjunction with his PRS Artist to get many of his heavily overdriven guitar sounds from the Earth Moving album onwards. Oldfield has also been using guitar synthesizers since the mid-1980s, using a 1980s Roland GR-300/G-808 type system, then a 1990s Roland GK2 equipped red PRS Custom 24 (sold in 2006) with a Roland VG8, and most recently a Line 6 Variax.
Oldfield has an unusual playing style, using fingers and long right-hand fingernails and different ways of creating vibrato: a ""very fast side-to-side vibrato"" and ""violinist's vibrato"". Oldfield has stated that his playing style originates from his musical roots playing folk music and the bass guitar.

Keyboards
Over the years, Oldfield has owned and used a vast number of synthesizers and other keyboard instruments. In the 1980s, he composed the score for the film The Killing Fields on a Fairlight CMI. Some examples of keyboard and synthesised instruments which Oldfield has made use of include Sequential Circuits Prophet-5s (notably on Platinum and The Killing Fields), Roland JV-1080/JV-2080 units (1990s), a Korg M1 (as seen in the ""Innocent"" video), a Clavia Nord Lead and Steinway pianos. In recent years, he has also made use of software synthesis products, such as Native Instruments.

Recording
Oldfield has self-recorded and produced many of his albums, and played the majority of the featured instruments, largely at his home studios. In the 1990s and 2000s he mainly used DAWs such as Apple Logic, Avid Pro Tools and Steinberg Nuendo as recording suites. For composing orchestral music Oldfield has been quoted as using the software notation program Sibelius running on Apple Macintoshes. He also used the FL Studio DAW on his 2005 double album Light + Shade. Among the mixing consoles Oldfield has owned are an AMS Neve Capricorn 33238, a Harrison Series X, and a Euphonix System 5-MC.

Personal life
Family
In 1978, Oldfield married Diana Fuller, a relative of the Exegesis group leader. The marriage lasted for three months. Oldfield recalled that he phoned Branson the day after the ceremony and said he had made a mistake. From 1979 to 1986, Oldfield was in a relationship with Sally Cooper, whom he met through Virgin. They had three children. In 2015, his son Dougal died after collapsing while working at a film production company in London. By the time of birth of their third child, in 1986, the relationship had broken down and they amicably split. Oldfield entered a relationship with Norwegian singer Anita Hegerland, that lasted until 1991. The pair met backstage at one of Oldfield's gigs while touring Germany in 1984. They lived in Switzerland, France, and England. They have two children.
In the late 1990s, Oldfield posted in a lonely hearts column in a local Ibiza newspaper. It was answered by Amy Lauer; the pair dated, but the relationship was troubled by Oldfield's bouts of alcohol and substance abuse and it ended after two months. In 2001, Oldfield began counselling and psychotherapy. Between 2002 and 2013, Oldfield was married to Fanny Vandekerckhove, whom he met while living in Ibiza. They have two sons.

Other
Oldfield and his siblings were raised as Catholic, their mother's faith. 
In June 1978, during the recording of Incantations, Oldfield and his siblings completed a three-day Exegesis seminar, a controversial self-assertiveness programme based on Werner Erhard's EST training programme. The experience had a significant effect on Oldfield's personality, who recalled that he underwent a ""rebirth experience"" by reliving past fears. ""It was like opening some huge cathedral doors and facing the monster, and I saw that the monster was myself as a newborn infant, because I'd started life in a panic."" Following the Exegesis seminar, the formerly reclusive Oldfield granted press interviews, posed nude for a promotional photo shoot for Incantations, and went drinking with news reporters. He had also conquered his fear of flying, gained a pilot's licence, and bought his own plane.
He used drugs in his early life, including LSD, which he said affected his mental health. In the early 1990s, Oldfield set up Tonic, a foundation that sponsored people to receive counselling and therapy.
In 1980, Oldfield, a longtime fan of model aircraft, acquired his pilot's licence. He later became a motorcycle enthusiast and has been inspired to write songs from riding them. He has owned various models, including a BMW R1200GS, Suzuki GSX-R750, Suzuki GSX-R1000, and a Yamaha R1.
Oldfield has lived in Nassau, Bahamas, since 2009 and is a Bahamian citizen. He has also lived in Spain, Los Angeles and Monaco. In 2012, Oldfield stated that he had decided to leave England after feeling that the country had become a ""nanny state"" with too much surveillance and state control. Oldfield has remarked that while he is close to other celebrity residents in the Bahamas, he chose not to live within a wealthy gated community with staff and described his lifestyle as ""austere.""
In 2017, Oldfield expressed support for then US President Donald Trump and said he would have played at Trump's inauguration if he had been invited to do so. In the same interview, he also stated that he was in favour of Brexit.

In 1981, Oldfield was awarded the Freedom of the City of London.

Mixmaster Morris,"Mixmaster Morris (born Morris Gould; 30 December 1965) is an English electronica DJ and underground musician who has also recorded as The Irresistible Force. His work in the 1990s blended ambient music and chill-out influences with UK dance styles.

Life and career
Morris Gould was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, but grew up in Lincolnshire and was educated at Millfield in Somerset, and King's College London. At 15 he founded a punk rock band, The Ripchords, whose sole release, an eponymous EP with four tracks, was championed by the BBC Radio One DJ John Peel. After leaving university, he began working as a DJ in 1985 with his ""Mongolian Hip Hop Show"" on pirate radio station Network 21 in London – the handle Mixmaster Morris was suggested by the station director. After a year of managing a club called ""The Gift"" in New Cross, which had been founded by Keith Gallagher and named after a Velvet Underground song, Morris began releasing material as The Irresistible Force in 1987 in collaboration with singer-songwriter Des de Moor. He became involved with the emerging UK acid house scene, after organising Madhouse at The Fridge, Brixton in 1988 – which was the subject of a piece by Peel in The Observer.
A show with the band Psychic TV led to him becoming full-time DJ with The Shamen, and touring with them on their 'Synergy' tours for nearly two years.
The first release as The Irresistible Force was the single, ""I Want To"" (1988), but success came with the first album, Flying High, released in 1992 on Rising High Records. In 1994, Morris released the second album Global Chillage which featured a holographic sleeve, and was released in the US on Astralwerks. After a period of legal problems, the third album It's Tomorrow Already came out on Ninja Tune.
In 1990, he made one of the first chillout compilations, Give Peace a Dance 2: The Ambient Collection for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, followed by the series Chillout or Die for Rising High Records. A mix tape for Mixmag shared with Alex Patterson was also released as a CD.  The Morning After became his first major-label mix album, followed by Abstract Funk Theory for Obsessive.
Through the 1990s he was a regular DJ in the chill out room at Return to the Source parties in London, around the UK and abroad. In 2003 he released the mix CD God Bless the Chilled for the Return to the Source Ambient Meditations series.
He has produced many remixes since 1985, including Coldcut's ""Autumn Leaves"". This remix was nominated by Norman Cook as his favourite chillout track on BBC Television. His mix for INXS was a Top 20 hit in the UK. Other early remixes were of Lloyd Cole, Dave Howard Singers, Bang Bang Machine, Stump, Higher Intelligence Agency, Sven Väth and Rising High Collective.
In the early 1990s his key residencies were alongside the Detroit masters at Lost, Megatripolis at London's Heaven, and also the Tribal Gathering parties. He became known for wearing holographic suits, produced by the company Spacetime, which he modelled for Vogue magazine. Throughout the decade, Morris wrote about electronic music for the NME, Mixmag, and i-D. He was resident on Kiss FM for several years, and then a regular on Solid Steel, the Ninja Tune syndicated radio show. He made his film debut in Modulations (Caipirinha Films), and his music was used in a number of other films including Groove and Hey Happy.
Morris has played in over fifty countries at nightclubs and parties, and particularly music festivals such as the Full Moon parties in the Mojave Desert, Glastonbury Festival, Rainbow 2000 and Mother SOS in Japan, Chillits in Northern California, and Berlin's Love Parade. He also ran the downtempo night Nubient in Brixton. In 1995, he played at the first The Big Chill festival, and then became a resident for the next 16 years.
He also collaborated with the German musician Pete Namlook under the name Dreamfish, recording two albums. Also with SF-based musician Jonah Sharp and Haruomi Hosono of Yellow Magic Orchestra he made the album Quiet Logic for the Japanese label Daisyworld.
In 1998 he joined the UK's Ninja Tune record label, with whom he toured as a DJ and made three releases. 1999 saw him win 'Best Chillout DJ' at the Ibiza DJ Awards at Pacha, Ibiza, and in 2001 he won the title for a second time, becoming the first DJ to achieve this. He has appeared in many lists of the world's top DJ's including the Ministry of Sound book The Annual and 2003's DJs by Lopez, and URB Magazine's Top 100 DJ list. Morris records regular radio shows for the Japanese internet radio station Samurai FM. In 2006 he started a new club at the Big Chill House in Kings Cross, London, and did a guest mix for BBC Radio 1's The Blue Room show. His essay about jazz was published in the book, Crossfade, and he made a one-off appearance reading it aloud.
In March 2007, together with Coldcut, he organised a tribute show to the writer and philosopher Robert Anton Wilson, which they performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. He also played in Goa for the first time with The Big Chill, and started a new residency at The Prince in Brixton. In May 2008 Morris undertook an ambient mix on BBC Radio 1, and put a The Irresistible Force band together to play at The Big Chill festival. In 2009, he compiled a podcast for Tate Britain to accompany their Altermodern exhibition, and opened a new AV night called MMMTV in Camden. The mix CD, Calm Down My Selector was released in January by Wakyo Records, and he made a tour of Japan to promote it.
In 2010, he won another Ibiza DJ Award, for the third time. In October that year, he was announced as Head of A+R for Apollo Records. 2011 saw him rejoin Bestival as part of their ""Ambient Forest"" team.
2017 saw Morris continue to stay at the top of the psybient/downtempo movement and charts, especially mixcloud where he held top positions in most categories relating to ambient music for the full year. 2017 also saw the triumphant return of Mixmaster Morris with his acclaimed release ""Kira Kira"", a lush soundscape that was received well by many publications and listeners and earned a spot in ""Extreme Chill's"" top twenty of 2017 along with releases by Brian Eno and Steve Roach.

Moby,"Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), known professionally as Moby, is an American musician, songwriter, singer, producer, and animal rights activist. He has sold 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him to be ""among the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United States and the United Kingdom"".
After taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer and remixer. His 1991 single ""Go"" was his mainstream breakthrough, especially in Europe, where it peaked within the top ten of the charts in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart including ""Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)"", ""Feeling So Real"", and ""James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)"". Throughout the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed Everything Is Wrong (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album Animal Rights (1996) alienated much of his fan base.
Moby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album Play (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold. Its seventh single, ""South Side"", featuring Gwen Stefani, remains his only one to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 14. Moby followed Play with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and downtempo music, starting with 18 (2002), Hotel (2005), and Last Night (2008). His later albums saw him explore ambient music, including the almost four-hour release Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep. (2016). Moby continues to record and release albums; his twenty-first studio album, Resound NYC, was released in May 2023.
In addition to his music career, Moby is known for his veganism and support for animal rights and humanitarian aid. He was the owner of TeaNY, a vegan cafe in Manhattan, and Little Pine, a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: Porcelain: A Memoir (2016) and Then It Fell Apart (2019).

Early life and influences
Richard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of Harlem in Manhattan, New York City. He is an only child of Elizabeth McBride (née Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor, who died in a car crash while drunk when Moby was two. His father gave him the nickname Moby three days after his birth as his parents considered the name Richard too large for a newborn baby. The name was also a reference to the ancestry Hall says he was told by his family, though he is not directly related to Herman Melville, author of Moby-Dick. Moby is distantly related to David Melville, inventor of the first United States-patented gas light system.
Moby was raised by his mother, first in San Francisco from 1969 for a short period. He recalled being sexually abused by a staff member at his daycare during this time. This was followed by a move to Darien, Connecticut, living in a squat with ""three or four other drug-addicted hippies, with bands playing in the basement."" The two then moved to Stratford, Connecticut, for a brief time. His mother struggled to support her son, often relying on food stamps and government welfare. They occasionally stayed with Moby's grandparents in Darien, but the affluence of the New York City suburb made him feel poor and ashamed. Shortly before his mother's death in 1997, Moby learned from her that he has a half brother. His first job was a caddy at a golf course.
Moby took up music at the age of nine. He started on classical guitar and received piano lessons from his mother before studying jazz, music theory, and percussion. In 1983, he became the guitarist in a hardcore punk band, the Vatican Commandos, playing on their debut EP Hit Squad for God. Around this time he was the lead vocalist for Flipper for two days; Moby played bass for their reunion shows in the 2000s. Moby formed a post-punk group named AWOL around the time of his eighteenth birthday. He is credited on their only release, a self-titled EP, as Moby Hall.
In 1983, Moby graduated from Darien High School and started a philosophy degree at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. Around this time he had found the instruments he had learned ""sonically limiting"" and moved to electronic music. He spun records at the campus radio station WHUS, which led to DJ work in local clubs and bars. Moby grew increasingly unhappy at university, however, and transferred to State University of New York at Purchase, studying philosophy and photography, to try and renew his interest in studying. He dropped out in April 1984 to pursue DJing and music full-time, which started his interest in electronic dance music. For two years he lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he DJ'd at The Cafe, an under-21 nightclub at the back of a church. In 1987, he started to send demos of his music to record labels in New York City; he failed to receive an offer, which led to a two-year period of ""very fruitless labor"". Around 1988, Moby moved into a semi-abandoned factory in Stamford, Connecticut, that had no bathroom or running water, but the free electricity supply allowed him to work on his music, using a 4-track recorder, synthesizer, and drum machine.
Moby cites English band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) as ""heroes"", without whom he would never have begun making electronic music. His other formative influences include Nick Drake, Suicide, Silver Apples, Eric B. & Rakim, and Public Enemy.

Career
1989–1993: Signing with Instinct, ""Go"", and breakthrough
In 1989, Moby relocated to New York City with his close friend, artist Damian Loeb. In addition to performing DJ sets in local bars and clubs, he played guitar in alternative rock group Ultra Vivid Scene and appeared in the video for their 1989 single ""Mercy Seat"". In 1990, Moby joined Shopwell and played on their album Peanuts. Moby's first live electronic music gig followed in the summer of 1990 at Club MK; he wore a suit for the show. His future manager Eric Härle, who was in attendance, recalled Moby's set: ""The music was amazing, but the show was riddled with technical mishaps. It left me very intrigued and impressed in a strange way.""
By mid-1990, Moby had signed a deal as the sole artist of Instinct Records, an independent New York City-based dance label then still in its infancy. The three-man operation saw Moby answer incoming calls and make records in a studio he set up in the owner's lounge. To appear that Instinct had more artists, Moby's early singles were put out under several names such as Voodoo Child, Barracuda, Brainstorm, and UHF. The first, ""Time's Up"" as The Brotherhood, was co-written by Moby and vocalist Jimmy Mack. This was followed by ""Mobility"", his first single released as Moby, in November 1990, which sold an initial 2,000 copies. He then scored a breakthrough hit with a remix of ""Go"", originally a B-side to ""Mobility"" with an added sample of ""Laura Palmer's Theme"" by Angelo Badalamenti from the television series Twin Peaks. Released in March 1991, it peaked at No. 10 in the UK in October and earned him national exposure there with an appearance on Top of the Pops. Instinct capitalised on Moby's success with the late 1991 compilation Instinct Dance featuring tracks by Moby and his pseudonyms. The following year, Moby revealed that ""Go"" had earned him just $2,000 in royalties.
The success of ""Go"" led to increased demand for Moby to produce more music and to remix other artists' songs. He often arranged for the artist and himself to trade remixes as opposed to being paid for his work, which was the case for his mixes for Billy Corgan and Soundgarden. The increased mainstream exposure led Moby to request a release from his contract with Instinct for a bigger label. Instinct refused, so Moby retaliated by holding out on new material. However, Instinct continued to put out records, mostly from demos, without his consent having previously copied many of his tapes and had the master rights. This was the case for Moby's debut album, Moby, released in July 1992 and formed mostly of previously unreleased demos that Moby considered old and unrepresentative of the musical direction he had taken since. Nonetheless, he claimed Instinct had insisted and had the legal right to put it out. It was re-titled The Story So Far and presented with a different track listing for its UK release. Four singles were released: ""Go"", ""Drop a Beat"", ""Next Is the E"", and a double A-side of ""I Feel It"" with ""Thousand"". The latter was recognised by Guinness World Records as the fastest tempo in a recorded song at 1,015 beats-per-minute.
In 1992, Moby completed his first US tour as the opening act for The Shamen. In mid-1992, Moby estimated that he had earned between $8,000 to $11,000 a year for the past six years. At the 1992 Mixmag awards, he smashed his keyboard after his set. After his second nationwide tour, this time with The Prodigy and Richie Hawtin, in early 1993, a second compilation of Moby's work for Instinct followed named Early Underground. His second and final album on Instinct, Ambient, was released in August 1993. It is a collection of mostly ambient techno instrumentals of a more experimental style. By this time Instinct had agreed to release Moby who then took legal action, claiming that the label demanded ""a ridiculous amount of money"" that he did not have to leave. He also expressed disagreements over the way Instinct had packaged and handled his music. Moby was eventually released after he paid the label $10,000.

1993–1998: Signing with Elektra, Everything Is Wrong, and Animal Rights
In 1993, Moby signed with Elektra Records, which lasted for five years. He secured a deal with Mute Records, a British label, to handle his European distribution. Moby's output for Elektra/Mute began with Move, a four-track EP released in August 1993. He attempted to make it in a professional studio, but he disliked the results and re-recorded it at home. The song ""All That I Need Is to Be Loved (MV)"" is his first song to feature his own vocals. The first single, ""Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)"", reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and No. 21 in the UK. In 1993, Moby toured as the headlining act with Orbital and Aphex Twin. A rift developed between Aphex Twin and himself, partly due to Moby's refusal to tolerate their cigarette smoke, so he travelled to each gig by plane, leaving the rest on the tour bus. In 1994, Moby put out Demons/Horses, an electronic album of two 20-minute tracks under the name Voodoo Child.
Moby's contract with Elektra allowed the opportunity to make his third full-length album, which was underway in 1994. He chose to include a variety of musical styles on the album that he either liked or had been influenced by, including electronic dance, ambient, rock, and industrial music. Everything Is Wrong was released in March 1995 to critical praise; Spin magazine named it Album of the Year and some commentators considered it to be an album ahead of its time as it failed to crack the Billboard 200 or have an impact on the dance charts. In the UK, the album reached No. 25 and the singles ""Hymn"" and ""Feeling So Real"" went to Nos. 31 and 30, respectively. Elektra took advantage of its diverse sound by distributing tracks of the same style to corresponding radio stations nationwide. Early copies put out in the UK and Germany included a bonus CD of ambient music entitled Underwater. Moby toured the album with some headline spots on the second stage at the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. He followed it with a double remix album, Everything Is Wrong—Mixed and Remixed.
The success of Everything Is Wrong had Moby reach a new peak in critical acclaim. The Los Angeles Times thought the 29-year-old Moby was ""poised for greatness [...] to make that big crossover"" from a respected underground artist to a mainstream dance and rock musician. Billboard declared him ""King of techno"" and Spin named him ""the closest techno comes to a complete artist."" In 1995, Moby was approached by Courtney Love to produce the next Hole album, but he declined. He directed the music video for ""Young Man's Stride"" by Mercury Rev. In 1995 and 1996, Moby put out a number of ""self-indulgent dance"" singles under the pseudonyms Lopez and DJ Cake on Trophy Records, his own Mute imprint, so he could release material that he was interested in without concern for its commercial impact. In 1996, Moby contributed ""Republican Party"" to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization and released his second Voodoo Child album, The End of Everything.
While touring Everything Is Wrong, Moby had grown bored with the electronic scene and felt the press had failed to understand his records and take them seriously. This marked a major stylistic change for his next album, Animal Rights, combining guitar-driven rock songs with Moby on lead vocals and softer ambient tracks. Upon completing the album Moby said that it was ""weird, long, self-indulgent and difficult"". Its lead single is a cover version of ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver"" by post-punk group Mission of Burma. Animal Rights was released in September 1996 in the UK, where it peaked at No. 38, and in February 1997 in the US. It was poorly received by his dance fan base who felt Moby had abandoned them, creating doubts as to what kind of artist Moby really was. Moby pointed out that he had not abandoned his electronic music completely and had worked on dance and house mixes and film scores while making Animal Rights.
After Animal Rights, Moby's manager recalled: ""We found ourselves struggling for even the slightest bit of recognition. He became a has-been in the eyes of a lot of people in the industry"". Despite the hit in sales and critical response, Moby promoted the album with a European tour with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Soundgarden, and headlined the Big Top tour with other dance and electronic DJs. He returned to the genre after liking the house music that a friend and DJ had played at a party. In October 1997, Moby displayed his range of music styles with the release of I Like to Score, a compilation of his film soundtrack work with some re-recorded tracks. Among them are updated version of the ""James Bond Theme"" used for Tomorrow Never Dies, music used in Scream, and a cover of ""New Dawn Fades"" by Joy Division, an instrumental version of which appeared in Heat. Late 1997 saw Moby start his first US tour in two years.
In 1998, Elektra granted Moby's request to be released from his deal on the condition that he paid to leave, which amounted to ""quite a lot"". He felt Elektra did little to capitalise on the critical success of Everything Is Wrong, and that it was only interested in radio friendly hits. Left without an American distributor, his only deal remained with the UK-based Mute Records. Moby considered himself an artist that did not belong to a major label as his music did not fit with the genres that they promoted.

1999–2004: Play, worldwide success, and 18
Moby's fifth album, Play, was released by Mute and V2 Records in May 1999. The project originated when a music journalist introduced Moby to the field recordings of Alan Lomax from the compilation album Sounds of the South: A Musical Journey From the Georgia Sea Islands to the Mississippi Delta. Moby took an interest in the songs and formed samples from various tracks which he used to base new tracks of his own. Upon release in May 1999, Play had moderate sales but eventually sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Moby toured worldwide in support of the album, which lasted 22 months. Every track on Play was licensed to various films, advertisements, and television shows, as well as independent films and non-profit groups. The move was criticised and led to some to consider that Moby had become a sellout, but he later maintained that the licenses were granted mostly to independent films and non-profit projects, and agreed to them due to the difficulty of getting his music heard on the radio and television in the past. In 2007, The Washington Post published an article about a mathematical equation dubbed the ""Moby quotient"" that determined to what degree had a musical artist sold out. It was named in reference to his decision to license music from Play.

In 2000, Moby contributed ""Flower"" to Gone in 60 Seconds. He co-wrote ""Is It Any Wonder"" with Sophie Ellis-Bextor for her debut solo album, Read My Lips. Moby: Play - The DVD, released in 2001, features the music videos produced for the album, live performances, and other bonus features. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In 2001, Moby founded the Area:One Festival which toured the US and Canada across 17 shows that summer with a range of artists. The set included Outkast, New Order, Incubus, Nelly Furtado, and Paul Oakenfold, with Moby headlining.
Moby started on the follow-up to Play in late 2000. Prior to working on tracks for 18, he got friends to search for records with vocals that he could use and make samples from and went on to write over 140 songs for the album. At the same time, Moby familiarised himself with the ProTools software and made 18 with it. Released in May 2002, 18 went to No. 1 in the UK and eleven other countries, and No. 4 in the US. It went on to sell over four million copies worldwide. Moby toured extensively for both Play and 18, playing over 500 shows in the next four years. The tour included the Area2 Festival in the summer of 2002, featuring a line-up of Moby, David Bowie, Blue Man Group, Busta Rhymes, and Carl Cox. In December 2002, during a tour stop at Paradise Rock Club in Boston, Moby was punched in the face and sprayed with mace by two or three assailants while signing autographs outside the venue. The incident left him with multiple bruises and cuts.
In February 2002, Moby performed at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. That month he hosted the half-hour MTV series Señor Moby's House of Music, presenting a selection of electronic and dance music videos. His song ""Extreme Ways"" was used in all five of the Bourne films, from 2002 to 2016. Moby said that after it was used for the first, the producers originally sought a different artist for the second but they had too little time to secure someone, leading them to pick ""Extreme Ways"" for the entire series. In 2002, rapper Eminem mocked Moby in his song ""Without Me"" and its music video, dressing up like him and calling him an ""old baldheaded fag"" and his techno music outdated. Eminem had also shot a mock figure of Moby on stage. Moby put the attack down to Eminem having ""this unrequited crush on me.""
In 2003, Moby headlined the Glastonbury Festival on the final day. He co-wrote and produced ""Early Mornin'"" for Britney Spears' album In the Zone released that year. Moby returned to his dance and rave roots with the release of Baby Monkey, the third album under his Voodoo Child moniker, in 2004. Later that year, he collaborated with Public Enemy on ""Make Love Fuck War"", a protest song against the Iraq War.

2004–2010: Hotel, Last Night, and Wait for Me
Moby's seventh album, Hotel, was released in March 2005. The album contains little use of samples, which Moby reasoned to using different audio recording software which had a sampling function that was too difficult to learn, ""so it was me just being lazy"". He nonetheless said that Hotel is a more satisfying album as a result. The instruments were recorded live by Moby except for the drums, for which he enlisted his longtime live drummer Scott Frassetto. The album features vocals from six other performers, including Laura Dawn and Shayna Steele. In 2013, Moby looked back on the album as his least favourite of his career, pointing out that it was the only one not recorded at his home studio. The singles ""Lift Me Up"" and ""Slipping Away"" became top-10 hits across Europe. Early copies of the album included a bonus CD of remixes and ambient music entitled Hotel: Ambient that was released on its own in 2014.
In 2006, he accepted an offer to score the soundtrack for Richard Kelly's 2007 movie Southland Tales, because he was a fan of Kelly's previous film, Donnie Darko. In 2007, Moby also started a rock band, The Little Death with his friends Laura Dawn, Daron Murphy, and Aaron A. Brooks. Following the dissolution of V2 Records in 2007, Moby signed a new deal with Mute Records to handle his American distribution. In 2007 Moby produced and performed on a remake of ""The Bulrushes"" by The Bongos that appeared on the special anniversary edition of the group's debut album Drums Along the Hudson, on Cooking Vinyl Records. From 2007 to 2008 he ran a series of New York club events titled ""Degenerates"".
In 2008, Moby released Last Night, an electronic dance album inspired by a night out in his New York City neighborhood. The album was recorded in Moby's home studio and features various guest vocalists, including Wendy Starland, MC Grandmaster Caz, Sylvia of Kudu, MC Aynzli, and the Nigerian 419 Squad. The singles from Last Night include ""Alice"" and ""Disco Lies"".

Moby wished for the follow-up to Last Night to be emotional, personal, and melodic. He felt creatively inspired by a David Lynch speech at the BAFTA Award ceremony in the UK which prompted him to write new material that he liked with little regard to its mainstream commercial success. He decided against recording in a professional studio as he wanted to record the entire album at home, and chose to have the album mixed using analogue equipment. Wait for Me was released on June 30, 2009. Moby and Lynch discussed the recording process of Wait for Me on Lynch's online channel, David Lynch Foundation Television Beta. The video to the first single, ""Shot in the Back of the Head"", offered as a free download, was directed by Lynch.
Moby held a user-generated content competition to have fans create a video for ""Wait for Me"", the last single from the album, which was to be used as the official video. The winning entry was written and directed by Nimrod Shapira of Israel, and portrays the story of a girl who decides to invite Moby into her life. She attempts to do so by using a book called How to Summon Moby, A Guide for Dummies, putting herself through bizarre and comical steps, each is a tribute to a different Moby video. The single was released in May 2010.
The Wait for Me tour featured a full band. Moby raised over $75,000 from three shows in California to help those affected by domestic violence after funding for the state's domestic violence program had been cut. The tour also saw Moby headline the Falls Festival in Australia and various Sunset Sounds festivals. An ambient version Wait for Me was released in late 2009 as Wait for Me: Ambient, which Moby did not produce.
In 2010, Moby enlisted vocalist Phil Costello as a songwriting partner for a new heavy metal band, Diamondsnake. After writing 13 songs, they recruited guitarist Dave Hill and a drummer named Tomato to complete the line-up. They recorded their self-titled debut album in one day and released it for free on their website. It was promoted with a series of gigs in New York City and Los Angeles. Moby contributed four songs to the soundtrack of The Next Three Days, including the single ""Mistake"".

2010–2015: Destroyed and Innocents
In January 2010, Moby announced that he had started work on a new album. He later summarised its style as: ""Broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m."" The album was promoted with an EP containing three tracks from the album, given free to those who had signed up to Moby's mailing list, entitled Be the One, in February 2011. The album, Destroyed, was released in May 2011. A same-titled book of Moby's photography was released around the time of the album. Moby took to an online poll to decide the next single from Destroyed; the fans picked ""Lie Down in Darkness"". This was followed by ""After"" and ""The Right Thing"", both influenced by what fans had picked. A limited edition remixed version of Destroyed was released in 2012 as Destroyed Remixed and includes new remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost! and System Divine, and a new 30-minute ambient track named ""All Sides Gone"".
Moby toured worldwide throughout 2013, completing acoustic and DJ sets at various concerts and festivals. His DJ set at Coachella was produced in collaboration with NASA with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. On Record Store Day in 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record, The Lonely Night, featuring Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Moby, Photek, Gregor Tresher, and Freescha.
In October 2013, Moby released Innocents. He had worked on the album for the previous 18 months and hired Spike Stent to produce it. Moby used several guest vocalists on the album, and picked Neil Young and ""Broken English"" by Marianne Faithfull as the biggest influences to the musical style on the album. As with Destroyed, the photographs used for the artwork were all shot by Moby. The first single from the album was ""A Case for Shame"", followed by ""The Perfect Life"", which featured Wayne Coyne. A casting call for its video asked ""for obese Speedo-sporting bikers, nude rollerskating ghosts, and an S&M gimp proficient in rhythmic gymnastics"". Moby promoted the album with three shows at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, following his decision to undergo little touring from 2014. He wrote: ""Pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.""
Six of Moby's songs are feature in Charlie Countryman (2013). His music set the tone to Cathedrals of Culture (2014), a 3D documentary film about the soul of buildings, directed by Wim Wenders. In December 2014, Moby performed three shows of ambient music at the Masonic Lodge in Hollywood Forever Cemetery to support the release of Hotel: Ambient. The performances were accompanied by visuals created by himself and with David Lynch.

2016–present: Recent albums and documentary
After Innocents, Moby proceeded to make a new wave dance album with a choir, but realised the difficulty in recording a full choir in his home studio and resorted to multi-tracking vocals performed by himself and guests. He then decided against the new wave album and opted for one made by himself and seven guest vocalists he named the Void Pacific Choir. These Systems Are Failing was announced in September 2016 and coincided with the first single release, ""Are You Lost In The World Like Me?"". Its video, by animator Steve Cutts, addresses smartphone addiction which won a Webby Award. These Systems Are Failing was released on October 14, 2016. Moby's sole live performance of 2016 was at Circle V, a vegan food and music festival that he founded that took place on October 23 at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles. A second album with the Void Pacific Choir name followed in June 2017, entitled More Fast Songs About the Apocalypse, influenced by the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Released for free online, it was marketed from a spoof website using elected President Donald Trump's alleged PR alter-ego, John Miller.

Moby announced his fifteenth studio album, Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt, in December 2017. The announcement coincided with the release of the first single, ""Like a Motherless Child"". In contrast to the politically inspired and punk nature of the two Void Pacific Choir records, the album explores themes of spirituality, individuality, and humanity. The album was released on March 2, 2018. The second single, ""Mere Anarchy"", was described by Moby as ""post apocalypse, people are gone, and my friend Julie and I are time traveling aliens visiting the empty Earth."" ""This Wild Darkness"" was the third single, released in February 2018. Moby described the song as ""an existential dialog between me and the gospel choir: me talking about my confusion, the choir answering with longing and hope."" Moby promoted the album with three live shows in March 2018 with a full band, one at The Echo in Los Angeles and two at Rough Trade in New York City. All profits from the album and gigs were donated to animal rights organizations.
In 2018, Moby was a guest performer on ""A$AP Forever"" by American rapper A$AP Rocky which samples ""Porcelain"". This resulted in Moby's second ever appearance on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, having previously charted for ""Southside"", 17 years prior. Moby contributed several songs to the comedy Half Magic (2018) directed by Heather Graham.
In March 2019, Moby released a follow-up to his first long ambient album, Long Ambients 2.
In January 2020, Moby announced that his new studio album All Visible Objects will be released on May 15. The first single, ""Power is Taken"" featuring D. H. Peligro, was released on the same day as the announcement. All profits from the album will be given to charity.
In December 2020, Moby released another ambient album, Live Ambients – Improvised Recordings Vol. 1. It features tracks recorded under three conditions that he set himself: improvise with nothing written beforehand, no editing of the pieces after recording, and that every part of the process was to be ""calming"". The album was released on digital streaming platforms, followed by videos of Moby performing each track on December 30 on his YouTube channel.
A documentary titled Moby Doc on Moby's life and career was released digitally and theatrically in May 2021. The film was produced by his production company Little Walnut. Moby's next album, Reprise, was also released that month on Deutsche Grammophon. It features orchestral versions of his greatest hits with multiple guest artists. The album charted in 16 countries and includes vocals by Gregory Porter, Kris Kristofferson, Jim James and more. In May 2022, Moby released Reprise Remixes, featuring remixes of tracks from the Reprise from various artists, including Topic, Anfisa Letyago, Planningtorock, and Biscuits.
On June 1, 2022, Moby launched his new record label, Always Centered at Night. He established it to sign ""emerging and fascinating variety of singers to join with me in making music they might not have been able to make elsewhere."" The first single, ""Medusa"", features Grammy nominated singer Aynzli Jones.
On January 1, 2023, Moby released a two-and-a-half-hour ambient album Ambient 23. It was made almost exclusively with dated drum machines and synthesizers, with his ""early ambient heroes"" as sources of inspiration, including Brian Eno and Jean-Michel Jarre.

Collaborations
Moby has collaborated live with many of his heroes while on tour or at fundraisers. He has performed ""Walk on the Wild Side"" with Lou Reed, ""Me and Bobby McGee"" with Kris Kristofferson, ""Heroes"" and ""Cactus"" with David Bowie, ""Helpless"" with Bono and Michael Stipe, ""New Dawn Fades"" with New Order, ""Make Love, Fuck War"" with Public Enemy, ""Whole Lotta Love"" with Slash, and ""That's When I Reach For My Revolver"" with Mission of Burma.
He has performed two duets with the French singer Mylène Farmer (""Slipping Away (Crier la vie)"" in 2006 and ""Looking for My Name"" in 2008) and produced seven songs on her eighth album, Bleu Noir, released on December 6, 2010 and two songs on her twelfth album L'Emprise,released on November 25,2022 . She also sang the vocals to the rework of the song ""Hyenas"" present on the Resound NYC album.
In 1992 he contributed vocals to song ""Curse"" on Recoil's ""Bloodline"" (Alan Wilder's solo project, he was Depeche Mode member at time of that recording). Moby arguably later used this inspiration for his breakthrough 1999 album, Play, for which he used several old field recordings by Alan Lomax, much as Wilder had used a 1937 recording of White's ""Shake 'Em On Down"".
In 2013, Moby was responsible for the soundtrack of the documentary The Crash Reel, who tells the story of snowboarder Kevin Pearce.
On October 16, 2015, Jean Michel Jarre released his compilation album Electronica 1: The Time Machine, which included the track ""Suns have gone"" co-produced by Jarre and Moby.
On September 24, 2016, Moby announced the release of an album titled These Systems Are Failing, released under the name Moby & Void Pacific Choir. The followed the release of two singles from Moby & The Void Pacific Choir in 2015, ""Almost Loved"" & ""The Light Is Clear In My Eyes"".

TV work
Starz aired a special episode of Blunt Talk, the Patrick Stewart comedy which involved Moby. He had been friends with Jonathan Ames for a long time, and ""when we both lived in NY we did a lot of really strange, cabaret, vaudeville type shows together, and we just sort of stayed friends over the years. I guess when he and the other writers were writing Blunt Talk one of them thought it would be funny to include me as Patrick Stewart's character's ex-wife's current boyfriend.""
Moby was one of the first musicians to have an episode on Netflix's new music documentary series titled Once In a Lifetime Sessions; where he records, discusses, and performs his music.
Moby Doc, a documentary about the artist's life was released on May 28, 2021.
His documentary Punk Rock Vegan Movie was released in February 2023.

Business ventures
Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the Little Idiot Collective—a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio that sold the work of an ""illustrators collective"". In May 2002, Moby launched a small raw and vegan restaurant and tea shop called TeaNY in New York City with his then girlfriend Kelly Tisdale. In 2006, Moby said he had removed himself from any previous business projects.
In November 2015, Moby opened the Vegan restaurant Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself. All profits are donated to animal welfare organizations; in May 2016, Moby estimated the year's donations at $250,000. In December 2019, Moby launched the Little Pine lifestyle range of products and merchandise, with all profits donated to six charities.
On August 23, 2016, Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir. The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as ""the coming together of my life's work, animal rights and music. I couldn't be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining.""
The second Circle V event took place on November 18 this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.

Personal life
Moby lived in New York City for 21 years. From 1996 to 2010, he lived in an apartment on Mott Street where he also recorded his albums. He then relocated to the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, spending almost $4 million to purchase a castle known as Wolf's Lair (built in 1927 by developer L. Milton Wolf), spending an additional $3.5 million to restore it. He also owns an apartment in Little Italy, Manhattan. In 2014, Moby sold the castle and downsized to a smaller home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.

In June 2013, Moby and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.
Moby identifies himself as heterosexual and cisgender; in a 2018 interview with The Guardian, he claims to have felt ""disappointed"" to be straight. He does date, but has stated that he feels more comfortable alone than in a relationship. In 2016 he was in a relationship, his first in ten years, that spanned at least eight months. He has no children.
In 2019, in his book Then It Fell Apart, he claimed to have had a brief relationship with actress Natalie Portman in the late 1990s. In response, Portman denied the story and called Moby's account ""disturbing"" (she was 18 at the time, while he was 33), with Portman further describing their interactions as ""a much older man being creepy with me"". He later apologized to Portman, saying: ""I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14 year age difference I absolutely should've acted more responsibly and respectfully."" 
Moby practices meditation and has explored different types, including transcendental, Mettā, and Vipassanā.

Veganism and animal rights
In 1984, Moby was inspired to become a vegetarian by a cat named Tucker that he had found at a dump in Darien, Connecticut. ""My mom and I, with the help of George the dachshund, took care of Tucker and he grew up to be the happiest, healthiest cat I'd ever known"". In November 1987, while playing with Tucker, ""I decided that just as I would never do anything to harm Tucker, or any of our rescued animals, I also would never do anything to harm any animal, anywhere"", and became a vegan. He is a strong supporter of animal rights, and described it as his ""day job"" other than musical projects.
In March 2016, Moby supported the social media campaign #TurnYourNoseUp to end factory farming in association with the nonprofit organization Farms Not Factories.
In 2019, Moby had ""Vegan for life"" tattooed on his neck by his friend, tattoo artist Kat Von D. That November, he had ""Animal rights"" tattooed on his arms to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of being a vegan. He also had ""VX"" tattooed next to his right eye, the ""V"" standing for vegan and the ""X"" for straight edge, referencing his sobriety.
In February 2023 he released Punk Rock Vegan Movie, his documentary about the relationship between the  worlds of punk rock and animal rights.

Drug use
From 1987 to 1995, Moby described his life as a ""very clean"" one and abstained from drugs, alcohol, and ""for the most part"", sex. After taking LSD once at nineteen, he started to suffer from panic attacks which he continued to experience, but he learned to deal with them more effectively. Moby recalls that shortly after his mother died from lung cancer in 1997, he had ""an epiphany"" and began to experiment with alcohol, drugs, and sex. This continued for four years after the commercial success of Play. He became a self-confessed ""old-timey alcoholic"". During his 18 tour in 2002 he found himself being argumentative and alienating close friends. At the end of the year he wished to make amends and live a healthier lifestyle and promised a girlfriend that he would quit alcohol for one month; he lasted two weeks. Moby continued to drink to excess and would ask audiences at concerts to give him drugs. Matters culminated shortly after he turned 43 when he attempted suicide; he had his last drink on October 18, 2008, and has since attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2016, he said of his sobriety: ""Since I stopped and reoriented myself towards things that have meaning, everything has gotten a million times better"".

Spirituality and faith
Moby has adopted different faiths throughout his life. He identified himself as an atheist when he was growing up, followed by agnostic, then ""a good eight or ten years of being quite a serious Christian"", during which time he taught Bible studies. Around 1985, he read the teachings of Christ, including the New Testament and the Gospels and ""was instantly struck by the idea that Christ was somehow divine. When I say I love Christ and love the teachings of Christ, I mean that in the most simple and naïve and subjective way. I'm not saying I'm right, and I certainly wouldn't criticize anyone else's beliefs.""
In the liner notes of Animal Rights (1996), Moby wrote: ""I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a Christian in the conventional sense of the word, where I go to church or believe in cultural Christianity, but I really do love Christ and recognize him in whatever capacity as I can understand it as God. One of my problems with the church and conventional Christianity is it seems like their focus doesn't have much to do with the teachings of Christ, but rather with their own social agenda"". In 2014, Moby pointed out that if he needed to label himself, it would be as a ""Taoist–Christian–agnostic quantum mechanic."" In 2019, Moby said that he is not a Christian, ""but my life is geared towards God [...] I have no idea who or what God might be.""

Charity
Moby is an advocate for a variety of causes, working with MoveOn.org, The Humane Society, and Farm Sanctuary, among others. He created MoveOn Voter Fund's Bush in 30 Seconds contest along with singer and MoveOn Cultural Director Laura Dawn and MoveOn Executive Director Eli Pariser. The music video for the song ""Disco Lies"" from Last Night has heavy anti-meat industrial themes. He also actively engages in nonpartisan activism and serves on the Board of Directors of Amend.org, a nonprofit organization that implements injury-prevention programs in Africa.
Moby is a member of the board of directors of the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function (IMNF), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing scientific inquiry into music and the brain and to developing clinical treatments to benefit people of all ages. He has also performed on various benefit concerts to help increase awareness for music therapy and raise funds for the institute. In 2004, he was honored with the IMNF's Music Has Power Award for his advocacy of music therapy and for his dedication and support to its recording studio program.
He is an advocate of net neutrality and testified before a United States House of Representatives committee debating the issue in 2006.
In 2007, Moby launched MobyGratis.com, a website of unlicensed music for filmmakers and film students to use in any independent, non-commercial, or non-profit film, video, or short. If a film is commercially successful, all revenue from commercial licence fees granted via Moby Gratis is donated to Humane Society of the United States.
In 2008, he participated in Songs for Tibet, an album to support Tibet and the Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. In a 2021 interview, he discussed the experience and called the Dalai Lama ""a wonderful inspired and inspiring man"".
In April 2009, Moby spoke about his personal experiences of Transcendental Meditation at the benefit concert Change Begins Within of the David Lynch Foundation in New York City. In April 2015, Moby performed ""Go"" at the evening of a David Lynch tribute event, hosted at the Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, which highlighted the work of the David Lynch Foundation and raised funds to teach Transcendental Meditation to local youth.
In April 2018, Moby auctioned more than 100 pieces of musical equipment via Reverb.com to raise funds for the nonprofit organization Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, thinking it was better to sell it for a good cause rather than keep it in storage. Moby held a second sale for the organization in June 2018 consisting of his personal record collection, including records that he used for DJ sets in his early career and his personal copies of his albums. A third was held in October 2018 that included the sale of almost 200 analog drum machines, 100 instruments, and his entire vinyl collection.
In 2018, Moby participated in Al Gore's 24-hour broadcast on climate change and other environmental issues.
Moby is an advocate for Best Friends; he was part of the No-Kill Los Angeles (NKLA) launch celebration and directed a lyric video for his song ""Almost Home"" that features dogs and cats from the Best Friends Pet Adoption and Spay/Neuter Center in Mission Hills, California.

Photography
Moby developed an interest in photography at age ten when his uncle, a photographer for The New York Times, gave him a Nikon F camera. He cites Edward Steichen as a major early influence. At 17 he set up a darkroom in his basement and pursued photography while at university. Moby kept his photography private until 2010, when he put some of his work on public display at the Clic Gallery and the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. In May 2011, Moby released a photography book called ""Destroyed"" containing pictures that were taken during the Wait for Me tour in 2010. It was released in conjunction with his same-titled album, and pictures from it were also put on display. From October to December 2014, Moby showcased his Innocents collection of large-scale photographs at the Fremin Gallery, featuring a post-apocalyptic theme and a cast of fictitious cult members wearing masks.

Books
In March 2010, Moby and animal activist Miyun Park released Gristle: From Factory Farms to Food Safety (Thinking Twice About the Meat We Eat), a collection of ten essays by various people in the food industry that they edited to detail ""unbiased, factual information about the consequences of animal production"" and factory farming.
In 2014, Moby began writing an autobiography covering his life and career from his move to New York City in the late 1980s to the recording of Play in 1999. He enjoyed the experience, and wrote approximately 300,000 words before cutting it by half to reach a rough edit of the book. Porcelain: A Memoir was released on May 17, 2016, by Penguin Press. Moby put out the compilation album Music from Porcelain to coincide the book's release, featuring his own tracks and a mixtape of tracks by other artists.
His second memoir, Then It Fell Apart was released on May 2, 2019, and covers his life and career from 1999 to 2009.
In September 2021, Moby published The Little Pine Cookbook, featuring vegan recipes developed from his time owning his restaurant.

NME article about Moby's Play tour (2000)"
Murcof,"Murcof is the performing and recording name of Mexican electronic musician Fernando Corona.
Corona was born in 1970 in Tijuana, Mexico and raised in Ensenada. He was for a time a member of the Tijuana-based Nortec Collective of electronic musicians under the Terrestre project name. In 2000, he returned to Tijuana. Since 2006, Corona has been living in Barcelona, Spain.

Music
Murcof's music is sparse, minimalist electronic music. Many of his compositions are founded on abstract, glitchy, sometimes complex electronic percussion. Harmonic and melodic influences come from classical music (modern classical music, musique concrète, holy minimalism, micropolyphony, baroque music, etc.), ambient music, drone music, berlin school synthesizer music, ethnic music and free improvisation. Rhythms are derived from minimal techno, dub, glitch, industrial music and IDM, and are often aligned around a 4/4 beat. The more recent works in the Murcof catalogue no longer include electronic beats.
His earlier works, like the 2001 EP Monotonu, feature orchestral instruments sampled from recordings of works by modern composers such as Arvo Pärt and Morton Feldman. Some of his later works, like the 2005 album Remembranza, incorporate samples of Corona and his friends playing classical instruments. Besides his personally initiated albums, Corona worked as Murcof on the 2008 commission project The Versailles Sessions, in which he reinterpreted recordings of a baroque ensemble. Live shows of Murcof featured guest musicians from varied musical backgrounds, like jazz trumpet player Erik Truffaz, tabla player Talvin Singh, crossover electronica-classical pianist Francesco Tristano and contemporary composer Philippe Petit.

Biography and influences
Early youth (1970)
Murcof was born as Fernando Corona in 1970 in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. His earliest contact with music came from his home, where his father sang, played bass and accordion. Corona tried some of these instruments as his father bought a very cheap organ for him and his sister. He began to wonder how these sounds were made, becoming primarily interested in the sound design aspect of music. His father's record collection included Bach, The Beatles and The Carpenters. His mother listened more to traditional Mexican music. Corona was taught by his father to pay attention to the compositions and arrangements of both classical and pop music, which helped him to better understand what elements in music he liked or not.
On his eight-year (1978) he moved to Chula Vista, close to the United States border. He went to school and learned English across the U.S. border, in San Diego. A few years later (around 1980) he moved 100 miles south, to a small port called Ensenada.
At the age of eleven (1981) Corona was introduced to electronic music by a friend of his father's who gave him a tape of Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygène. Soon afterwards he got fascinated by electronic‐classical crossover through a present from his father, an album on which Jon Santos plays Bach on a classic Moog synthesizer. This resulted in him purchasing other electronic music from artist such as the Berlin School synthesizer gurus Tangerine Dream, Japanese electronica composer Isao Tomita and Mexican ethnic crossover (new age) composers Jorge Reyes and Antonio Zepada (link in Spanish). The US was Corona's ""window to the world"", as he had to cross the US border to obtain records and magazines.

First electronic instruments (1985)
Around his fifteenth Corona started to play music, taking piano and music theory lessons from 1985 to 1989. He bought his first keyboard in 1985, one out of the Casio Sample Keyboard series, which made him excited as he could use it to record and transform snippets of everyday sounds.
For a while Corona enjoyed an alternative club in Tijuana, called Iguanas. There he developed a taste for mid 80s industrial (Play It Again Sam, Wax Trax! Records and Nettwerk labels, Skinny Puppy, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, KMFDM, and In The Nursery) and synthpop (e.g. Depeche Mode’s A Broken Frame (1982) and Black Celebration (1986)).
Around 1988 Corona acquired some more sophisticated equipment. His first professional keyboard was a synthesizer, the Kawai K1. Corona was “blown away” by the concept of designing his own sounds with oscillators and waveforms. He also began to program sounds on the Commodore 64. He started to write his own compositions influenced by techno pop (e.g. Kraftwerk), acid house and industrial. He continued in that style by forming the live act Vortex together with two of his friends. The group was active from 1988 to 1991.
Besides electronic music Corona was also listening pre‐1900 classical music during his whole teens. His uncle employed him as a warehouse manager around the mid 80s. In 1988 he started his study to become a computer programmer, but dropped out in 1990. By then he was focusing on DJing with his mobile DJ system and later as a resident DJ in a club in Ensenada. From 1992 to 2000 he worked in a nursing agency that dealt primarily with the elderly and terminally ill in San Diego (USA).

Prog-rock (1991)
In this period of time Corona played keys (and occasionally guitar, drums and flute) in the rock band Sonios, which was first influenced by British pop music like The Smiths, but later went into the direction of prog rock, jazz fusion, ambient and post rock. Corona states that this was a learning school for him about the various elements of music. He took influences from the local rock scene. The 1998 Sonios album ‘200 Fonios’ was released on Tijuana indie label Nimboestatic, won various prizes from cultural institutions in the Baja California region, was rated one of the best rock albums of 1998 by the Mexican press and reached a cult status in many places of Mexico and Latin America.

Electro-acoustic projects (1994)
Whilst in Sonios, Corona also engaged in other musical co‐operations like Elohim (1994‐1995), an experimental multimedia group, and Arvoles (1995‐1997), an acoustic‐ambient crossover project including a female vocalist. Then Corona got to compose for modern dance ensembles in Ensenada, an experience that led him to develop a taste for modern academic music, from the dodecaphonism and minimalism of the early 20th century to the experimentalists and serialists of the mid 1900s. Also, he grew tired of pre‐1900 classical music having listened to it for all his teens and adolescence. Upon hearing Xenakis’ Oresteia, plus later Pleiades and Metastasis, as well as Ligeti’s Lux Aeterna his perception of music altered immediately and drastically.
Some of the other composers he became interested in where Igor Stravinsky, Wolfgang Rihm, Giya Kancheli, Arnold Schoenberg, Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi, Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Stefano Scodanibbio (piece: Voyage That Never Ends).
Corona took his electronic experiments in a more extreme direction, playing with feedback effects to create walls of noise. He began to digitally process samples of classical music and mix them up with doom metal, death metal, ambient and noise.
Non‐classical music he listened in that time were for example Steve Roach’s dark ambient record The Magnificent Void (1996). As well as Squarepusher’s mix of jazz, D&B and acid (IDM) on Hard Normal Daddy (1997). And the at that time freshly emerging glitch genre initiated by the Raster-Noton label (formed in 1990 by Alva Noto, Frank Bretschneider and Olaf Benders (byetone)). Also capturing Corona's attention were the ambient noise of Deathprod (active from 1994). And the Icelandic post‐rock band Sigur Rós (active since 1997).
Corona studied cello at the Centro de Estudios Musicales in Ensenada in the years 1993 and 1994. In 1995 and 1996 Corona had private lessons in audio engineering in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. In 1998 and 1998 he studied audio engineering and music arrangement at Harper's Music, Chula Vista, California, USA.

Terrestre and Nortec (1999)
Early 1999 Corona leaves Sonios to fully focus on his solo electronic project Terrestre, for which his goal was to bring together the worlds of ambient electronica, pre‐Hispanic music and other ethnic sounds. For this project Corona sampled from vinyl records in the styles of tambora (small bass drum music), danzón (traditional Cuban dance music which also flourishes in Mexico) and salsa (the broad and internationally used term for popular Cuban dance music like Cuban son montuno, guaracha, chachachá, mambo, bolero, etc.).
In a later period of 1999 he gets an e‐mail from three Tijuana based electronic musicians (Fusible, Bostich and Panoptica) inviting electronic musicians to work with some norteña and tambora tracks downloaded from a studio in Tijuana. This way he became a part of the team of electronic musicians, DJs and graphic artists who would soon develop the Nortec Collective. Nortec's objective is to blend traditional Mexican norteño‐tex‐mex border culture with electronic dance music and visual projections. It grew from being a local phenomenon to getting some worldwide recognition (e.g. by Time Magazine, NY Times).

Murcof - MF Relay / Martes / Monotonu (2001)
In 2001, during his Terrestre activities, Corona's Murcof project comes alive out of the need to explore modern classical territories, like the holy minimalism of Henryk Górecki and Arvo Pärt and the post‐modern atmosphere of Valentyn Sylvestrov. In 2002, whilst experimenting with digital effects on samples of Arvo Pärt and Morton Feldman he creates his first Murcof track: MF Relay, a track with glitchy minimal techno percussion, a synth drone and “sliced and diced” samples from orchestral percussion, choir, piano, strings and woodwinds.
Somewhere around here Corona started to listen to Deathprod’s electro‐acoustic free improv (jazz) band Supersilent, particularly their releases 4 (1998) and in later times 6 (2003) and 7 (2005). He also took influences from Oren Ambarchi (a musician in the free improv and noise spectrum) and ambient/dub/electronica producer Biosphere.
Martes, the first Murcof album, came out in the year Corona became a father. With this album Corona continued to work in the MF Relay style of minimal dance rhythms interwoven with samples from holy minimalism and other modern classical sources. Corona later stated that the composing wasn’t a hard job for him: ""It almost composed itself"".
Corona left Nortec in 2002. He then teamed up with artists and personal friends Rubén Tamayo (Fax) and Eji Val (Ejival) from Nimboestatic (the label that released Sonios ‐ 200 Fonios) to create the Electronic label Static Discos, which in 2002 released Martes as a CD in Mexico.
Corona was at Barcelona's Sónar Festival in 2001 to perform with the Nortec Collective when a friend of his insisted he would give his Murcof demo CD to Tony Marley of UK based independent record label The Leaf Label. So he went to meet Tony in a club and gave him the demo. This led to the worldwide vinyl and CD release of Martes, three months after its Mexican CD debut with Static Discos. The pioneering MF Relay track did not become a part of Martes, but was published, also in 2002, by Context Free Media (label by multidisciplinary artist Seth Joshua Horvitz) on the Monotónu 12”. Martes received an almost instant universal praise from well known magazines like The Wire UK and consecutively Murcof got to play at festivals like Montreal's Mutek and the next edition of Sónar.
Martes was reissued by The Leaf Label in 2015 as part of the label's 20th anniversary celebrations. This was a special triple LP release combining the original album with unreleased tracks and the 2004 album Utopia.

Terrestre commissions (2002)
A friend of Corona's, Argentinian Latin‐crossover composer and multi-instrumentalist Gustavo Santaolalla, was involved in the production of Nuevo, an album of Mexican compositions performed by modern classical string ensemble Kronos Quartet. Santaolalla asked Nortec to get involved, resulting in Terrestre finding its spot on the 2002 Nortec remix EP of Kronos Quartet ‐ El Sinaloense.
Corona also got commissioned to remix Miles Davis.
Later Corona moved into the domain of film scores when he got commissioned as Terrestre to compose the soundtrack of the film Nicotina, a dark comedy by the producers of one of Mexico's biggest ever films, Amores Perros. The film was released in 2003 and the CD came out in 2004.
Other commissions included music for a Heineken commercial focused on the Latin American market (USA, 2002), an Edwin Jeans commercial (JP, 2002) the documentary Iraq - Counting The Cost (UK, 2004), a trailer for the Edinburgh Film Festival (UK, 2004), Barratt Urban Development (USA, 2004), Valencia Biennale (2003).
Mexican electronica netlabels Mandorla, Cyan Recs, Umor Rex and Soundsister caught Corona's around this time attention.

Murcof - Ulysses / Utopía (2003)
In 2003 followed another Murcof release on The Leaf Label, the Ulysses EP. Corona's focus began to shift from sampling records to recording musicians, the violin and double bass on this record were recorded from Tijuana musicians, giving parts of the music a more live feel.
Utopía saw the daylight in 2004 when it was published as a CD by The Leaf Label. This album came to realization as a result of the success of Martes. It contained seven remixes and four new Murcof tracks. Corona has stated that it was exciting and inspiring for him to select people to remix his works. He also called Utopía a self-indulgent record. On his four new tracks he experimented with placing the aesthetics of Martes into less conventional structures. Corona later claimed to be extremely proud of this record and to regularly relisten it. He sees Utopía as an important transition from the Martes style into the style of his upcoming album Remembranza.
The remixers were Sutekh (Californian multimedia artist Seth Joshua Horvitz (Sutekh) of Context Free Media), Jan Jelinek (German experimental minimalist who released on labels such as Berlin's ~scape), Deathprod (Norwegian ambient noise composer Helge Sten, who earlier produced Motorpsycho), Icarus (UK based experimental electronica duo Ollie Bown and Sam Britton), Fax (Ruben Alonso Tamayo, Mexican minimal techno producer and co‐founder of Static Discos), Aeroc (Geoff White, melodic IDM producer releasing on the renowned electronica label Ghostly International) and Colleen (the French Cécile Schott, sample transforming and cello playing colleague from The Leaf Label).

Terrestre - Secondary Inspection (2004)
It took Corona from 1999 to 2004 to release his first full-length Terrestre record. Secondary Inspection became a creepy mix of electronic dance music, Latin percussion and ambient electronics. It contained processed sounds of Tijuana street musicians, which Corona ""reduced to a pulp of post 9/11 paranoia"".

Murcof - Remembranza (2005)
The second full-length Murcof album Remembranza came out in 2005 and helped Corona cope with the turmoil of his mother passing away. Remembranza was produced during her illness until her death and became a requiem for her. The Murcof aesthetic moved a bit away from minimalism towards more complex and melancholic harmonic progressions, slightly reminiscent of his prog-rock past. Recordings of his friends or himself playing classical instruments played a significant role on this album. Corona stated that he could hardly play them, but that did not bother him too much as he was mainly interested in texture and vibe.
In 2005 Native Instruments released the sample pack Synthetic Drums 2 for use with their software drum instrument Battery or software sampler Kontakt. It included samples by Speedy J, Jake Mandell, Plaid, Telefon Tel Aviv, Atom Heart, Murcof and other artists.

Live with Singh, Truffaz and Tristano (2006)
A trio with Talvin Singh on tabla and Erik Truffaz was formed in this year. Both of these artists had a firm background in acoustic‐electronic crossover. The trio played sporadically in the following years, at for example Montreux Jazz 2006 and in Mumbai in 2010.
Corona got to master the album Not For Piano by Luxembourg crossover electronic‐classical pianist/synthesist Francesco Tristano. In 2007 Corona and Tristano started the Not For Piano live duo, which for example toured the UK in 2010.

Murcof - Cosmos (2007)
In 2007 Corona released the third Murcof album Cosmos. It was a spacious dark ambient record which included dense walls of textures (hinting at Ligeti), abstracted sounds of synth pioneers, intense climaxes and on some tracks glitchy dub and techno beats. Corona stated that it expressed some personal changes in his life, including his move from Ensenada to Barcelona in 2006. Before moving to Europe, Corona sold his hardware instruments, including a Roland Juno‐106 and Moog Prodigy. Corona described the album as follows: “Cosmos is a celebration of our existence, of the universe: we must see beyond the skyscrapers around us, look above, look the star and the sky.”

Murcof - The Versailles Sessions (2008)
In the summer of 2007 Corona got invited by Les Grandes Eaux Nocturnes (an annual festival of sound, light and water at Château de Versailles in France) to compose a 6 speaker composition for the grand evening fountain display in the Jardin du Roi. The Versaille Sessions is an aural document of that installation. GetSound, who commissioned the project, hired a Parisian group of musicians specialized in baroque music. Murcof and the musicians resided in the GetSound studio in Paris for two days to record the musicians’ interpretations of compositions from the baroque time, from for example Jean-Baptiste Lully, Henry Purcell and François Couperin. The pieces were played traditionally as well as with note and instrument experimentation. They experimented with modifying the score, tempo, pitch and by inserting random pauses. Texturally they explored the instruments by throwing all sorts of material inside the harpsichord and pounding on the viola da gamba's body, capturing a wide range of timbres, giving Corona many composing options. Corona stated it was a great learning experience for him thanks to the musicians’ open mindedness and fun approach. Corona described the composition process as partially different from the usual Murcof composition method. He was processing previously recorded acoustic material as usual, but this time the source material was very specific 17th century baroque and the experiments in the studio were already a part of the composing process. Two weeks before the opening Corona went to the site wanting to get an impression of the sound, but could not make the necessary tests due to pouring rain. He did realize though that he was going in the wrong musical direction. He thought the big space demanded a different sound: more openness, more time for the sounds to develop and resonate. So in the remaining two weeks he reworked the whole commission into The Versailles Sessions.

Projects with AntiVJ (2008)
Early 2008 Corona was commissioned by the Contemporary Music Network of England to create the live audio-visual Océano show for a UK tour. ""Blackout Arts"" member Flicker (Roderick Maclachlan) created visuals live on stage by using camera feeds from micro-installations of dust, smoke, plants, dark water and live scratch animations. He used feedback effects to manipulate the video and his visuals responded to the music. Live instrumentation was served by Spanish classical ensemble BCN 216 and consisted of cello, viola and trombone.
June 2008 Corona played a space themed audio-video show in The Planetarium of Bristol, during the Venn Festival. Visuals were improvised by Joanie Lemercier of visual arts label AntiVJ.

Murcof on The Leaf Label"
Mythos (musical project),"Mythos is a Canadian new age musical project started by Bob D'Eith and Paul Schmidt in 1996. Bob (piano) and Paul (guitar) collectively wrote, produced, and performed on the albums with the help of various session performers. The centerpiece of the Mythos sound rests on the acoustic guitar and piano, which are accented by guest vocalists. Synthesizers and performances in various other musical styles are regularly incorporated into the music.

History
Robert (Bob) D'Eith attended the University of Victoria in the 1980s, receiving both a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Law (LLB) from this institution. Before creating Mythos, he played keyboards in Rock band Rymes with Orange, and contributed to the scores of a number of film and television productions. Throughout his musical career, he also maintained a private legal practice in Entertainment Law, and currently holds the titles of President for Adagio Music (Mythos' label, formerly ""Spark""), and Executive Director of Music BC.
D'Eith and Schmidt formed Mythos in 1995. Mythos' initial releases, Introspection and Iridescence, were on D'Eith's Spark Records and were confined to the Canadian market. The success of these albums led to Mythos' distribution by the Higher Octave label, who first released an eponymous album containing mostly songs from prior releases. This release was commercially successful, peaking at 18 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart. Higher Octave went on to release two more studio albums by the group, both of which placed on the Billboard chart. Higher Octave has been restructured multiple times in the past few years by its parent labels, Narada and EMI. The most recent Mythos album, Purity, is being distributed by Pacific Music and Alula Records. In 2010, Mythos released Rain, a remixed version of Wind (from Introspection), in celebration of the group's 15 year anniversary.
In 2013, Mythos released ""Journey"" on Adagio Music/The Orchard, followed in 2015 with a special 20th Anniversary Vinyl Best of Mythos collection. August 3, 2018 Mythos released the EP ""Eros"" on Adagio Music/The Orchard. In 2021, Mythos released a 25th Anniversary Album ""XXV"" featuring 5 new tracks and 9 fully remastered classics.

Musical style
Critics have described Mythos as New Age, Ambient, Ethereal, and Film-Oriented, with influences from Jazz, Classical, Gospel-Soul, and various World styles.

Mythos
Background

The liner notes claim this release includes ""the best of the previously released album Introspection plus seven new tracks,"" but a number of the remaining songs were included on Iridescence. The track name ""The Odyssey"" does not seem to appear prior to this eponymous album, but it actually is the track ""Catheral"" on Introspection.

Music BC"
Neu!,"Neu! (pronounced [nɔʏ]; German for ""New!""; styled in block capitals) were a West German krautrock band formed in Düsseldorf in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother following their departure from Kraftwerk. The group's albums were produced by Conny Plank, who has been regarded as the group's ""hidden member"". They released three albums in their initial incarnation—Neu! (1972), Neu! 2 (1973), and Neu! 75 (1975)—before disbanding in 1975. They briefly reunited in the mid-1980s.
Although Neu! had minimal commercial success during their existence, the band are retrospectively considered a central act of West Germany's 1970s krautrock movement. They are known for pioneering the ""motorik"" beat, a minimalist 44 rhythm associated with krautrock artists. Their work has exerted a widespread influence on genres such as electronica and punk.

History
1970–1971: Pre-formation
Neu! was formed in 1971 in Düsseldorf as an offshoot from an early line-up of another seminal krautrock band, Kraftwerk, whose early works were also produced by Conny Plank. Drummer Klaus Dinger had joined Kraftwerk midway through sessions for their eponymous debut album. Guitarist Michael Rother was then recruited to the Kraftwerk line-up on completion of the album. (Rother had been playing in a local band called The Spirits of Sound, the line-up of which also included drummer Wolfgang Flür, who would himself go on to join Kraftwerk two years later.)
Kraftwerk co-founder Ralf Hütter left the band at this point to complete his studies and, for six months, Kraftwerk consisted of a trio of Rother, Dinger and Florian Schneider. This line-up played sporadic gigs and made a live appearance on German television programme Beat Club. Recording sessions at Conny Plank's Windrose studio were unsuccessful (Rother later attributed the failure to ""a difference of temperament""). Dinger and Rother parted company from Schneider and began Neu! with Plank. Hütter rejoined Schneider and the pair continued recording the second Kraftwerk album with Plank.

1971–1975: Main career
The band name NEU! (""new!"") was inspired by the prevalence of the advertising business in Düsseldorf at the time, according to Dinger, who described it as ""the strongest word in advertising"" and even owned a pro forma advertising agency himself for the purpose of booking studios. The band's eponymous first album sold just 30,000 records, yet is today considered a masterpiece by many, including influential artists such as David Bowie, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. It included the Motorik benchmark tracks ""Hallogallo"" and ""Negativland"" (the band Negativland took their name from this track), and bizarre ""songs"" like ""Sonderangebot"".
Their second album, Neu! 2, features some of the earliest examples of musical remixes. The duo, excited about recording another album, decided to expand their horizons by purchasing several new instruments. With the money they had left as an advance from the record company, they could record only half an album's worth of material. The company would not increase their advance because the first album did not sell well enough and the label did not see a reason to further finance what was most likely to become a flop. To rectify the lack of material, the band filled the second side with manipulated versions of their already-released single ""Neuschnee""/""Super"", playing back each song at different speeds and sometimes warbling the music by messing with the tape machine or placing the record off center on the turntable. The songs ""Super 16"" and ""Super 78"" (slowed down and sped up versions of the proto-punk song ""Super,"" respectively) unwittingly became the theme songs to the 1976 martial arts cult classic Master of the Flying Guillotine by Jimmy Wang Yu. This film was later referenced by Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill Volume 1 by also featuring the track ""Super 16"".
Dinger and Rother were both very different when left to their own devices, and this led to their final album of the 1970s, Neu! '75 being two solo half-albums. Side One was Rother's more ambient productions which were similar to the first album, albeit more keyboard-driven. Side Two (particularly the song ""Hero"") was acknowledged as important influence by many later involved in the United Kingdom's punk rock scene, with Dinger's sneering, barely intelligible vocals searing across a distorted Motorik beat with aggressive single chord guitar pounding.
To aid with performing on the album (and more importantly, live), Hans Lampe and brother Thomas Dinger were enlisted to help execute more music than was possible by two men. Upon its release, and arguably to this day, Neu! '75 is the most diverse record available from the krautrock scene. While this can be seen as a positive point, the differences in musical direction (as well as personal issues) not only isolated the Dinger/Rother duo, it isolated their already small fan base. Neu! broke up after the release of Neu! '75.
Neu! are highly praised in Julian Cope's Krautrocksampler, along with other krautrock artists such as Kraftwerk and Can, and Cope has also written a song called ""Michael Rother"" which appears on CD2 of the Deluxe edition of the album Jehovahkill.

1975–1986: Band inactivity and reunion
In 1974, Rother had already collaborated with German electronic duo Cluster, recording as Harmonia an album titled Musik Von Harmonia. In 1975, he recorded a second Harmonia album, Deluxe, and further sessions followed with Brian Eno, which were not released until 1997 as Tracks and Traces. In 1977, Rother started recording as a solo artist. His first three albums; Flammende Herzen (1977), Sterntaler (1978), and Katzenmusik (1979) were recorded with Neu! producer Conny Plank.
Klaus Dinger, his brother Thomas and Hans Lampe formed La Düsseldorf, cited by David Bowie as ""the soundtrack of the eighties"". The band released three successful albums; La Düsseldorf (1976), Viva (1978) and Individuellos (1981).
Between October 1985 and April 1986, Dinger and Rother tried to rekindle the flame that was Neu! by adding more synthesizers and a slightly more commercial aspect to some compositions, the band sounded like a cross between their old selves and the recent new wave groups. However, they were torn apart again by personal and musical issues.
An example of the sharp contrast between Dinger and Rother was evidenced by such tracks as ""Crazy"", Rother's attempt at pop, and ""'86 Commercial Trash"", a Dingerian collage of dialogue and sound effects from Germany's television commercials of that year. The work that took place in these sessions would later resurface as Neu! 4 in late 1995.

1987–2009: Acrimony, CD reissues, Dinger's death
Dinger and Rother did not work together during the 1990s, and indeed some degree of bitterness existed between them, not least because Dinger had released a couple of old substandard Neu! recordings on the Japanese Captain Trip label without Rother's knowledge or consent.  In late 1995, this label released the previously mentioned Neu! 4 recordings from the 1985–1986 sessions.  It also released Neu! '72 Live in Düsseldorf (recorded on 6 May 1972), which comprised poorly recorded rehearsals for some abortive live shows, but notable for the inclusion of Eberhard Kranemann, who had briefly been in Kraftwerk with Dinger.
A 1999 tribute album, entitled A Homage to Neu! (Cleopatra Records), features covers from artists including the Legendary Pink Dots, Download, Autechre, Dead Voices on Air, Khan, System 7, and James Plotkin, as well as an original track from Rother entitled ""Neutronics 98 (A Tribute to Conny Plank)"". Plank had died in 1987.
For many years the acrimony and legal wrangling between Rother and Dinger prevented their reaching agreement over licensing arrangements to make Neu!'s music available on CD. In the ensuing vacuum, illegal and inferior-quality bootleg CDs (mastered from old vinyl records) were distributed by an outfit called Germanofon.
This situation was finally resolved in 2001, when Rother and Dinger put aside their differences and entered a studio to transfer the three Neu! albums to CD, from the original master tapes (reportedly mastering each album three times). These were produced and released by Grönland Records (licensed to the Astralwerks label in the United States), packaged with stickers featuring rave reviews by notable artists, including Thom Yorke. Following the release of the first three albums, Dinger and Rother tried but failed to agree on a legal release of Neu! 4. Rother called the failure of those negotiations ""unfortunate"".
Rother has said that he and Dinger had been considering recording a fifth Neu! album, but the idea was aborted after personal disagreements resurfaced between them. Dinger died of heart failure on 21 March 2008. Rother said that he was unaware of Dinger's illness until just before he died.
Rother writes and produces solo albums. Before his death, Dinger was a member of the band La! Neu? - whose name also irritated Rother - as well as collaborating with Miki Yui and band sub-tle. in a project that is unreleased to this date.

2009–present: Brand Neu!, Neu! '86, Hallogallo 2010
On 25 May 2009, the new record label Feraltone released a compilation CD called Brand Neu! containing tracks by many modern artists who credit Neu! as an influence. Most notably, it featured a track from Michael Rother from the previous Neu! homage album (A Homage to Neu!) and a new track by La Duesseldorf.de, one of Klaus Dinger's final recordings before he died. The compilation features both new and established artists from all around the world including Oasis, Primal Scream, Kasabian, School of Seven Bells, Ciccone Youth (Sonic Youth), Holy Fuck and the young band Pets With Pets from Australia. This was to outline the enormous influence of Neu! which spans multiple decades and countries.
The rights to the Neu! back catalogue are jointly owned by Rother, Dinger's estate and Plank's widow, Christa Fast. Rother worked with them to produce a box set that included all of Neu!'s recordings including material that appeared on the Neu! 4 album (now officially released as Neu! '86). Neu! Vinyl Box was released in May 2010 and Neu! '86 followed as a standalone release later that year. The box set included some of the 'live' recordings from 1972 on a maxi single.
In 2010 Rother teamed up with Steve Shelley (of Sonic Youth) and Aaron Mullan (of Tall Firs) for Hallogallo 2010, a live project to present Neu! music and some new pieces. He has since toured sporadically with the German trio Camera, performing the work of Neu!, Harmonia and his own solo music, occasionally with Dieter Möbius of Cluster. Since 2014 he has toured with Hans Lampe and former Camera guitarist Franz Bargmann.
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Neu! debut album, Rother played two concerts, Michael Rother & Friends: Celebrate 50 years NEU!. The first in Berlin, on 26 October 2022, and a second concert in London on 3 November 2022.

Musical style and influence
Neu!'s rhythms and sparse atmospherics have been widely influential on genres such as electronica and punk. Their sound was described as ""a droning, hypnotic style made up of Mr. Dinger’s simple, perpetual-motion rhythms and Mr. Rother’s fluid guitar effects"" by The New York Times critic Ben Sisario. Sisario called their first three albums ""landmarks of German experimental rock, a genre that was quickly labeled Krautrock by journalists and fans."" AllMusic noted their penchant for ""minimalist melodies and lock-groove rhythms.""
The band pioneered the ""motorik"" beat, a minimalist 4/4 beat often used by drummers associated with krautrock. It is characterised by a kick drum-heavy, pulsating groove, that created a forward-flowing feel. It was probably first used by the group on their debut album and was later adopted by other krautrock bands. Dinger himself later referred to it as the ""Apache beat"".
Artists such as David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, and Tortoise have drawn on the work of Neu! in their music. Siouxsie and the Banshees cited the band in their influences. Japanese experimental group Boredoms cite Neu! as a prominent influence on their later sound, evident in their unique application of tape manipulation remix techniques and driving 4/4 rhythms pioneered by Rother and Dinger.

New-age music,"New-age is a genre of music intended to create artistic inspiration, relaxation, and optimism. It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, and reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in homes or other environments. It is sometimes associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality; however, most of its artists have nothing to do with ""New Age spirituality"", and some even reject the term.
New-age music includes both acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non-Western acoustic instruments, and electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved, vocals have become more common, especially those featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan-influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends.
There is no exact definition of new-age music. An article in Billboard magazine in 1987 commented that ""New Age music may be the most startling successful non-defined music ever to hit the public consciousness"".  Many consider it to be an umbrella term for marketing rather than a musical category, and to be part of a complex cultural trend.
New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording. Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside) was one of the important predecessors. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969–79) featured natural soundscapes,  tintinnabulation, and ""Om"" chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings. Steven Halpern's 1975 Spectrum Suite was a key work that began the new-age music movement.

Definitions
New-age music is defined more by the use and effect or feeling it produces rather than the instruments and genre used in its creation; it may be acoustic, electronic, or a mixture of both. New-age artists range from solo or ensemble performances using classical-music instruments ranging from the piano, acoustic guitar, flute, or harp to electronic musical instruments, or from Eastern instruments such as the sitar, tabla and tamboura. There is also a significant overlap of sectors of new-age music with ambient, classical, jazz, electronica, world, chillout, pop, and space music, among others.
The two definitions typically associated with the new-age genre are:

New-age music with an ambient sound that has the explicit purpose of aiding meditation and relaxation, or aiding and enabling various alternative spiritual practices, such as alternative healing, yoga practice, guided meditation, or chakra auditing. The proponents of this definition are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes. To be useful for meditation, music must have repetitive dynamic and texture without sudden loud chords or improvisation, which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and musicians in the genre are mostly instrumentalists rather than vocalists. Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of instruments along with sounds of animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature, launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga.  Other prominent artists who create new-age music expressly for healing or meditation include Irv Teibel, Paul Horn, Deuter, Steven Halpern, Paul Winter, Lawrence Ball, Karunesh, Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Bhagavan Das, and Snatam Kaur.
Music found in the new-age sections of record stores. This is largely a definition of practicality, given the breadth of music classified as ""new age"" by retailers that are often less interested in finely grained distinctions between musical styles than are fans of those styles. Music that falls into this definition usually cannot be easily classified into other, more common definitions, but can contain almost any kind of music; it is more of a marketing slogan rather than musical category.

Debate and criticism
Stephen Hill, founder of Hearts of Space, considers that ""many of the artists are very sincerely and fully committed to New Age ideas and ways of life"". Some composers like Kitarō consider their music to be part of their spiritual growth, as well as expressing values and shaping the culture. Douglas Groothuis stated that rejection of all music labeled as ""new age"" would be to fall prey to a taboo mentality, as most of the music belongs to the ""progressive"" side of new-age music, where composers necessarily do not always have a New Age worldview.
However, it is often noted that ""new-age music"" is a mere popular designation that successfully sells records. J. Gordon Melton argued that it does not refer to a specific genre of music, but to music used for therapeutic or other new-age purposes. Kay Gardner considered the label ""new age"" an inauthentic commercial intention of so-called new-age music, saying ""a lot of new age music is schlock"", and how due to record sales, everyone with a home studio put in sounds of crickets, oceans or rivers as a guarantee of sales. What started as ambient mood music related with new-age activity became a term for a musical conglomeration of jazz, folk, rock, ethnic, classical, and electronica, among other styles, with the former, markedly different musical and theoretical movement.
Under the umbrella term, some consider Mike Oldfield's 1973 progressive rock album Tubular Bells one of the first albums to be referred to under the genre description of new-age. Others consider music by Greek composer Vangelis and general modern jazz-rock fusion as exemplifing the progressive side of new-age music. Other artists included are Jean-Michel Jarre (even though his electronic excursions predate the term), Andreas Vollenweider, George Winston, Mark Isham, Michael Hedges, Shadowfax, Mannheim Steamroller, Kitarō, Yanni, Enya, Clannad, Era, Tangerine Dream and Enigma.
However, many musicians and composers dismiss the labeling of their music as ""new age"". When the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album was first created in 1987, its first winner, Andreas Vollenweider, said, ""I don't have any intention to label my music... It's ridiculous to give a name to anything that is timeless"". Peter Bryant, music director of WHYY-FM (90.9) and host of a new-age program, noted that ""I don't care for the term... New-age has a negative connotation... In the circles I come in contact with, people working in music, 'new-age' is almost an insult"", that it refers to ""very vapid, dreamy kinds of dull music... with no substance or form or interest"", and that the term has ""stuck"".

Harold Budd said, ""When I hear the term 'new-age' I reach for my revolver... I don't think of myself as making music that is only supposed to be in the background. It's embarrassing to inadvertently be associated with something that you know in your guts is vacuous."" Vangelis considers it to be a style that ""gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music"". Yanni stated that ""I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested"", and that ""New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic."" David Van Tieghem, George Winston and Kitarō also rejected the label of new-age artist. David Lanz said that he ""finally figured out that the main reason people don't like the term new age is because it's the only musical category that isn't a musical term"". Andreas Vollenweider noted that ""we have sold millions of records worldwide before the category new age was actually a category"", and shared the concern that ""the stores are having this problem with categorization"".
Ron Goldstein, president of Private Music, agreed with such a standpoint, and explained that ""Windham Hill was the hub of this whole thing. Because of that association, new-age has come to be perceived as this West Coast thing"". However, Windham Hill's managing director Sam Sutherland argued that even the label's founders William Ackerman and Anne Robinson ""shied away from using any idiomatic or generic term at all. It's always seemed a little synthetic"", and they stopped making any kind of deliberate protests to the use of the term simply because it was inappropriate. Both Goldstein and Sutherland concluded that the tag helped move merchandise, and that new-age music would be absorbed into the general body of pop music within a few years after 1987.
The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles noted that ""new-age music"" absorbed other styles in more softer form, but those same, well-defined styles do not need the new-age category, and that ""new-age music"" resembles other music because it is aimed as a marketing niche—to be a ""formula show"" designated for urban ""ultra-consumers"" as status accessory; he also said the Andean, Asian and African traditional music influences evoke the sense of ""cosmopolitanism"", while nature in the album artwork and sound evoke the ""connection to unspoiled landscapes"".

Alternative terms
The borders of this umbrella genre are not well-defined, but music retail stores will include artists in the ""new-age"" category even if they belong to different genre, and those artists themselves use different names for their style of music.
Kay Gardner called the original new-age music ""healing music"" or ""women's spirituality"". Paul Winter,  considered a new-age music pioneer, also dismissed the term, preferring ""earth music"".
The term ""instrumental music"" or ""contemporary instrumental"" can include artists who do not use electronic instruments, such as solo pianist David Lanz. Similarly, pianists such as Yanni and Bradley Joseph use this term as well, although they use keyboards to incorporate layered orchestral textures into their compositions. Yanni has distinguished the music genre from the spiritual movement bearing the same name. The term ""contemporary instrumental music"" was also suggested by Andreas Vollenweider, while ""adult alternative"" by Gary L. Chappell, which was the term by which Billboard called the new-age and world-music album charts.

History
The concept arose with the involvement of professional musicians in the New-Age movement. Initially, it was of no interest to the musical industry, so the musicians and related staff founded their own small independent recording businesses. Sales reached significant numbers in unusual outlets such as bookstores, gift stores, health-food stores and boutiques, as well as by direct mail. With the demand of a large market, the major recording companies began promoting new-age music in the 1980s.
New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres—for example, folk-instrumentalists John Fahey and Leo Kottke, minimalists Terry Riley, Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass, progressive rock acts such as Pink Floyd, ambient pioneer Brian Eno, synthesizer performer Klaus Schulze, and jazz artists Keith Jarrett, Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside), Paul Winter (beginning in the mid-1960s with the Paul Winter Consort) and Pat Metheny.
Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is sometimes considered to be the first new-age recording, but initially it was popular mostly in California, and was not sold nationally until the 1980s. Another school of meditation music arose among the followers of Rajneesh; Deuter recorded D (1971) and Aum (1972), which mixed acoustic and electronic instruments with sounds of the sea. Kay Gardner's song Lunamuse (1974) and first recording Mooncircles (1975), which were a synthesis of music, sexuality and Wiccan spirituality, were ""new-age music before it got to be new-age music"". Her A Rainbow Path (1984) embraced Halpern's theory of healing music from that time with women's spirituality, and she became one of the most popular new-age sacred-music artists. Mike Orme of Stylus Magazine writes that many key Berlin school musicians helped popularise new-age.
Paul Winter's Missa Gaia/Earth Mass (1982) is described as ""a masterpiece of New Age ecological consciousness that celebrates the sacredness of land, sky, and sea"". His work on the East Coast is considered to be one of the most important musical expressions of new-age spirituality. On the West Coast, musicians concentrated more on music for healing and meditation. The most notable early work was Steven Halpern's Spectrum Suite (1975), the musical purpose of which was described as to ""resonate specific areas of the body... it quiets the mind and body"", and whose title relates ""to the seven tones of the musical scale and the seven colors of the rainbow to the seven etheric energy sources (chakras) in our bodies"". In the 1970s his music work, and the theoretical book Tuning the Human Instrument (1979), pioneered the contemporary practice of musical healing in the United States.
In 1976 the record label Windham Hill Records was founded, with an initial $300 investment, and would gross over $26 million annually ten years later. Over the years many record labels were formed that embraced or rejected the new-age designation, such as Narada Productions, Private Music, Music West, Lifestyle, Audion, Sonic Atmospheres, Living Music, Terra (Vanguard Records), Novus Records (which mainly recorded jazz music), FM (CBS Masterworks) and Cinema (Capitol Records).
Between the intentional extremes of the U.S.' coasts are some of the most successful new-age artists, like George Winston and R. Carlos Nakai. Winston's million-selling December (1982), released by Windham Hill Records, was highly popular. Most of Nakai's work, with his first release Changes in 1983, consists of improvised songs in native North American style. During the 1990s, his music became virtual anthems for new-age spirituality.
In 1981, Tower Records in Mountain View, California added a ""new age"" bin. By 1985, independent and chain record retail stores were adding sections for new age, and major labels began showing interest in the genre, both through acquisition of some existing new-age labels such as Paul Winter's Living Music and through signing of so-called ""new-age"" artists such as Japanese electronic composer Kitarō and American crossover jazz musician Pat Metheny, both signed by Geffen Records. Most of the major record labels accepted new age artists by the beginning of the next year. In the late 1980s the umbrella genre was the fastest-growing genre with significant radio broadcast. It was seen as an attractive business due to low recording costs.
Stephen Hill founded the new-age radio show Hearts of Space in 1973. In 1983, it was picked up by NPR for syndication to 230 affiliates nationally, and a year later Hill started a record label, Hearts of Space Records. On Valentine's Day in 1987, the former Los Angeles rock radio station KMET changed to a full-time new-age music format with new call letters KTWV, branded as The Wave. During The Wave's new-age period, management told the station employees to refer to The Wave as a ""mood service"" rather than a ""radio station"". DJs stopped announcing the titles of the songs, and instead, to maintain an uninterrupted mood, listeners could call a 1–800 phone number to find out what song was playing. News breaks were also re-branded and referred to as ""wave breaks"". Other new-age-specialty radio programs included Forest's Musical Starstreams and John Diliberto's Echoes. Most major cable television networks have channels that play music without visuals, including channels for New age, such as the ""Soundscapes"" channel on Music Choice. The two satellite radio companies Sirius Satellite Radio & XM Satellite Radio each had their own channels that played new-age music. Sirius—Spa (Sirius XM) (73), XM—Audio Visions (77). When the two merged in November 2008 and became SiriusXM, the Spa name was retained for the music channel with the majority of Audio Vision's music library being used.
In 1987 was formed the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, while in 1988 the Billboard's New Age weekly charts. In 1989 Suzanne Doucet produced and held the first international New-Age Music Conference in Los Angeles. By 1989, there were over 150 small independent record labels releasing new-age music, while new-age and adult-alternative programs were carried on hundreds of commercial and college radio stations in the U.S., and over 40 distributors were selling new-age music through mail-order catalogs.
In the 1990s many small labels of new-age style music emerged in Japan, but for this kind of instrumental music the terms ""relaxing"" or ""healing"" music were more popular. Enigma's Sadeness (Part I) became an international hit, reaching number one in 24 countries including UK, also number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling over 5 million worldwide. At the time Holland was the home of two leading European new-age labels—Oreade and Narada Media. Oreade reported that in 1997 the latest trend was ""angelic"" music, while Narada Media predicted that the genre would develop in the direction of world music (with Celtic, Irish and African influences). In 1995 some ""new-age"" composers like Kitarō, Suzanne Ciani and Patrick O'Hearn moved from major to independent record labels due to lack of promotion, diminishing sales or limited freedom of creativity.
In 2001 Windham Hill celebrated its 25th anniversary, Narada and Higher Octave Music continued to move into world and ethno-techno music, and Hearts of Space Records were bought by Valley Entertainment. Enya's ""Only Time"" peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album A Day Without Rain at #2 on the Billboard 200, being the number one new-age artist of the year.

Reviews New Age"
New Order (band),"New Order are  an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris. The members regrouped after the disbandment of their previous band Joy Division due to the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. New Order's integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. They were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and its nightclub The Haçienda, and they worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer Peter Saville.
While the band's early years were overshadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York club scene saw them increasingly incorporate dance rhythms and electronic instrumentation into their work. Their 1983 hit ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling 12-inch single of all time and a popular club track. In the 1980s, they released successful albums such as Power, Corruption & Lies (1983), Technique (1989), and the singles compilation Substance (1987). They disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects before reuniting in 1998. In the years since then, New Order has gone through various hiatuses and personnel changes, most prominently the departure of Hook in 2007 due to personal disputes with the other members. In 2015, they released their tenth studio album, Music Complete. In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

History
Origins and formation: 1977–1980
Between 1977 and 1980, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, and Bernard Sumner were members of the post-punk band Joy Division, often featuring heavy production input from producer Martin Hannett. Curtis died by suicide on 18 May 1980, the day before Joy Division were scheduled to depart for their first American tour, and prior to the release of the band's second album, Closer. The rest of the band decided soon after Curtis's death that they would carry on. Prior to his death, the members had agreed not to continue under the Joy Division name should any one member leave. On 29 July 1980, the still unnamed trio debuted live at Manchester's Beach Club. Rob Gretton, the band's manager for over 20 years, is credited for having found the name New Order in an article in The Guardian titled ""The People's New Order of Kampuchea"". The band adopted this name, despite its previous use for former Stooge Ron Asheton's band The New Order. The group states that the name New Order (as was also the case with ""Joy Division"") does not draw a direct line to Nazism or fascism.
The band rehearsed with each member taking turns on vocals. Sumner ultimately took the role, as he could sing when he wasn't playing his guitar. They wanted to complete the line-up with someone they knew well, and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own. Gretton suggested Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert, and she was invited to join the band in early October 1980 as keyboardist and guitarist. Her first live performance with the band occurred at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980.

Movement: 1981–1982
The initial release as New Order was the single ""Ceremony"", backed with ""In a Lonely Place"". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: ""I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really—for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.""
New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, ""Everything's Gone Green"" and ""Temptation"", saw a change in direction toward dance music.
The Haçienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled ""Prime 5 8 6"", but released 15 years later as ""Video 5 8 6"". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, ""Prime 5 8 6""/""Video 5 8 6"" was an early version of ""5 8 6"" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on ""Blue Monday"" and ""Ultraviolence"".

Power, Corruption & Lies: 1983–1984
Power, Corruption & Lies, released in May 1983, was a synthesiser-based outing and a dramatic change in sound from Joy Division and the preceding album, although the band had been hinting at the increased use of technology during the music-making process for a number of years then, including their work as Joy Division. Starting from what earlier singles had hinted, this was where the band had found their footing, mixing early techno music with their earlier guitar-based sound and showing the strong influence of acts like Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. Even further in this direction was the electronically sequenced, four-on-the-floor single ""Blue Monday"". Inspired by Klein + M.B.O.'s ""Dirty Talk"" and Sylvester's disco classic, ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling independent 12"" single of all time in the UK; however, (much to the chagrin of the buying public) it was not on the track list of Power, Corruption & Lies. The song was included however on the cassette format in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, and on the original North American CD release of the album, alongside its B-side, ""The Beach"". ""Blue Monday"" was also included on the 2008 collector's edition of Power, Corruption & Lies.
The 1983 single ""Confusion"" firmly established the group as a dance music force, inspiring many musicians in subsequent years. In 1984 they followed the largely synthesised single ""Thieves Like Us"" with the heavy guitar-drum-bass rumble of ""Murder"", a not-too-distant cousin of ""Ecstasy"" from the Power, Corruption & Lies album. KROQ Los Angeles DJ Jed the Fish claims New Order had more to do with the emergence of house music than the Warehouse music of Chicago and ""Frankie Knuckles and the whole so-called House music scene. Unless you were actually from regional Chicago, had you ever heard of House music until New Order? Be real, now.""
In 1983, DJ Producer Norman ""Chris"" Jester (Jester Productions / DJ Dizzo) brought a new energy to Blue Monday and in conjunction with Swedish Egil (KROQ), produced and released the New Order ""Counting Flowers"" Remix. Taking the masters back into the studio and re-engineering the synths and bassline, he created this popular 12"" club version. The new club mix version was first premiered at Phases nightclub in Canoga Park, California where he was one of the resident DJs. On the radio side, the new version was premiered that same night on KROQ's Dance Party Weekend with Swedish Egil.

Low-Life, Brotherhood, and Substance: 1985–1987
1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, guitar-based and electronic, and included ""The Perfect Kiss"" – the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme – and ""Sub-culture"". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring ""Shellshock"" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of ""Thieves Like Us"" and the instrumental ""Elegia"" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex.
Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" (a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand) and ""Angel Dust"" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK ""True Faith"" CD video single, under the title ""Evil Dust""), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single ""True Faith"". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion""—referred to as ""Temptation '87"" and ""Confusion '87"". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides ""Procession"" and ""Murder"". The single, ""True Faith"", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, ""1963""—originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release ""True Faith"" instead—would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions.
In December 1987, the band released a further single, ""Touched by the Hand of God"", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The song was one of four new tracks recorded for the American comedy film Salvation!, and reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart. However, it would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order.

Technique, Republic and first break-up: 1988–1993
By this time, the group was heavily influenced by the Balearic sounds of Ibiza, which were making their way into the Haçienda. Partly recorded at Mediterranean Sound studios on Ibiza, Technique was released in February 1989. The album entered the charts at number one in the UK and contained a mix of acid house influence (as on opening track ""Fine Time"") and a more traditional rock sound (as on the single ""Run 2""). The album is a blend of upbeat, accessible music coupled with blunt, poignant lyrics. During the summer of 1989, New Order supported Technique by touring with Public Image Ltd, Throwing Muses and the Sugarcubes across the United States and Canada in what the press dubbed the ""Monsters of Alternative Rock"" tour. Around this time, band members also began side projects including Electronic (Sumner with Johnny Marr) and Revenge (Hook with Davyth Hicks). Morris and Gilbert began to work together on outside TV theme production work. In 1991, the band were sued by the publishing company of American singer John Denver, who alleged that the guitar break in ""Run 2"" was similar to his song ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"". The case was settled out of court and the song has since been credited to both New Order and John Denver.
In 1990, New Order recorded the official song of the England national football team's 1990 World Cup campaign, ""World in Motion"", under the ad hoc band name EnglandNewOrder. The song, co-written with comedian Keith Allen, was the band's sole number one UK hit. The song was originally planned to be titled ""E for England"", however the Football Association vetoed the title upon realising that this was a reference to ecstasy; a drug heavily associated with the Haçienda. (Allen claimed that his original draft lyrics included ""E is for England, England starts with E / We'll all be smiling when we're in Italy."") The song also featured chanting from members of the England team and Allen, and a guest rap from England player John Barnes. It was again produced by Stephen Hague, who the band chose to produce their next album.
The band's next album Republic was shadowed by the collapse of their longtime label Factory Records. The label had been ailing due to financial difficulties, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1992. New Order never had a formal contract with Factory. Although unusual for a major group, this was Factory's standard practice until the mid-1980s. Because of this, the band, rather than Factory Records, legally owned all of their recordings. This has been cited by Wilson himself as the main reason London Records' 1992 offer to buy the ailing label fell through. Following Factory's collapse, New Order signed with London, as did Morris and Gilbert separately for their side project The Other Two, whose debut album was originally intended for release on Factory. Republic, released around the world in 1993, spawned the singles ""Regret""—New Order's highest-charting single in the US—""Ruined in a Day"", ""World"", and ""Spooky"".
Following the release and promotion of Republic, the band put New Order on hold while focusing on side projects; with The Other Two's debut album released in 1993. In 1994, a second singles collection was released, entitled The Best of New Order. It featured all of the band's singles since Substance as well as a few extra tracks: ""Vanishing Point"" (from 1989's Technique), ""The Perfect Kiss"", ""Thieves Like Us"", ""Shellshock"", and remixes of ""True Faith"", ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", ""1963"", and ""Round & Round"". The new versions of ""True Faith"" and ""1963"" (the latter as a more guitar-oriented version produced by Arthur Baker) were released as singles to promote the album. In the US, the track listing was altered to set it apart from Substance as well as the UK release of The Best of New Order which had been available months prior. This collection was followed by a remix album, The Rest of New Order, featuring a selection of existing and newly commissioned mixes of classic New Order tracks. Some versions contained an extra disc or cassette composed entirely of remixes of ""Blue Monday"". ""Blue Monday"" was released as a single for a third time to promote the collection.

Reformation and Get Ready: 1998–2003
The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, ""We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out."" By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's Reading Festival.
Their 2001 release Get Ready largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, ""Get Ready was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time."" Longtime fan Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track ""Turn My Way,"" and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track ""Rock the Shack"". Singles from the album included ""Crystal,"" ""60 Miles an Hour"" and Someone Like You.""
In 2002, Q featured New Order on their list of the ""50 Bands to See Before You Die"", although this was as part of a sub-list of ""5 Bands That Could Go Either Way"". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of the Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including Happy Mondays and the Durutti Column. The soundtrack featured the new track ""Here to Stay,"" produced by the Chemical Brothers, which was released as a single. The single's music video highlighted scenes taken from the film.

Waiting for the Sirens' Call, Singles and second break-up: 2004–2007
The band released a new album on 27 March 2005, titled Waiting for the Sirens' Call, their first with new member Phil Cunningham. Cunningham replaced Gilbert (now married to Morris) so she could look after their children. Singles from this album were ""Krafty"", ""Jetstream"" (which features guest vocals by Ana Matronic from Scissor Sisters), and the title track. At the 2005 NME Awards, New Order and Joy Division received the award for ""Godlike Geniuses"" (for lifetime achievement). Previous winners include Ozzy Osbourne, the Clash, and Happy Mondays. In 2006 the album track ""Guilt Is a Useless Emotion"" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording.
In the autumn of 2005, the group released another greatest hits compilation, in the form of Singles. The two-disc release was an updated version of the Substance collection and contained every single released from their 1981 debut all the way through to ""Waiting for the Sirens' Call"". However, unlike Substance, which focused almost exclusively on the 12"" versions of the group's singles, Singles collected the 7"" versions, many of which (like ""Ceremony"", ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion"") had never been released on CD. The album was accompanied by a two-disc DVD set, titled Item, that collected the extended UK version of NewOrderStory with a DVD of all New Order music videos as well as two newly commissioned videos for ""Temptation '87"" and ""Ceremony"".
The New Order: Live in Glasgow DVD was recorded at the Glasgow Academy in 2006 and features 18 tracks, including 4 Joy Division songs. Next to that, the release also contains a bonus disc of footage from the band's personal archive including 1980s footage from Glastonbury (June 1981), Rome, Cork, Rotterdam and Toronto.
In 2006, the band played several one-off live dates as well as short tours in the UK, Brazil and Argentina. After their Buenos Aires show in November 2006, Peter Hook suggested that the band should stop touring. In early May 2007, Hook was interviewed by British radio station XFM—originally to talk about his contribution to the debut album of Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell's new band Satellite Party—and stated that ""Me and Bernard aren't working together."" Further complicating the news, NewOrderOnline, a website with support from New Order management, reported that according to ""a source close to the band"", ""The news about the split is false... New Order still exists despite what [Hook] said ... Peter Hook can leave the band, but this doesn't mean the end of New Order."" However, Sumner revealed in 2009 that he no longer wished to make music as New Order.

Reunion with new line-up, Lost Sirens and Music Complete: 2011–2016
In September 2011, the band announced that they would perform for the first time since 2006, at the Ancienne Belgique, Brussels on 17 October and at the Bataclan, Paris on 18 October. The band's line-up included keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, who returned to the band after a ten-year break, and Bad Lieutenant bassist Tom Chapman in place of Peter Hook. They played subsequent shows in London and South America in December, and released Live at the London Troxy, a live album from their performance on 10 December 2011 at The Troxy in London.

They continued to tour throughout 2012, including a short tour of New Zealand and Australia in February/March, and several festival appearances in 2012. New Order performed at Hyde Park with Blur and the Specials to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.
Lost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. Lost Sirens is an eight-track album of songs recorded during the sessions for Waiting for the Sirens' Call. The album was discussed by Gillian Gilbert in a Brazilian interview to promote the band's appearance in São Paulo. She acknowledged issues with former member Peter Hook, and stated there was ""a lot going on behind the scenes on the copyright"" delaying the release.
The band debuted their first new song since the Waiting for the Sirens' Call sessions, ""Singularity"", during Lollapalooza Chile in March 2014. In July, the group toured North America, where they debuted another song, ""Plastic"". On 2 September the band signed to Mute Records. The New Order back catalogue remains with Warner Music.
On 22 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete, their first without Peter Hook. The album was produced mostly by the band themselves, except ""Singularity"" and ""Unlearn This Hatred"", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while ""Superheated"" features additional production by Stuart Price.
On 13 May 2016, New Order released a follow-up remix album Complete Music, which consists of extended and reworked mixes of each track from Music Complete.
In November 2015, Peter Hook sued Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert. In an objection, it was revealed that Sumner, Morris and Gilbert had set up a new company behind Hook's back, which generated an income of £7.8 million in four years, while Hook received only a fraction of that sum. The three members argued they had treated Hook fairly and that his stake in the band's royalties was reasonable, despite the fact that in four years, Hook had only received ""1.25 per cent of the band's royalties and other income from merchandising and performances"". The judge ruled that there was ""at least a reasonable prospect"" of Hook proving that he was not getting a fair share of royalties and other income and rejected Sumner and Morris's lawyer's argument. The judge was willing to hear the case but urged the parties to come to an agreement rather than suffer legal costs of around £900,000. On 20 September 2017, the band announced that a full and final settlement had been reached in the dispute.

Touring and recent work: 2017–present
On 13 July 2017, New Order played a concert at Manchester International Festival with Liam Gillick. On 12 July 2019 the performance was released as a live album titled Σ(No,12k,Lg,17Mif) New Order + Liam Gillick: So it goes.. (Live at MIF). The collaboration between Gillick and New Order was the subject of a documentary feature titled 'New Order: Decades', directed by Mike Christie and broadcast in the UK by Sky Arts and Showtime in the US.
On 23 August 2018, the band played the first date of a North American tour at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul Minnesota, US. Other stops on the tour included Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, DC; Toronto, Ontario; Long Beach, California; Kahului, Hawaii; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Another show was performed in Santiago, Chile in November 2018.
In January 2020, the band played a four night residency in Florida, and in February 2020, they announced a co-headlining tour in North America with the Pet Shop Boys, and that the only concert in the UK in 2020 would be at The O2 on 10 October. These tour dates were later rescheduled for 2021.
On 8 September 2020 the band released the single ""Be a Rebel"" 5 years after their previous release. A music video for the single, directed by NYSU, premiered on YouTube on 2 December.
On 11 February 2021, the band announced their plans to release a live album and concert film of their 2018 show at London's Alexandra Palace, directed by Mike Christie. Entitled Education Entertainment Recreation (Live at Alexandra Palace), it was released on 7 May.
New Order kicked-off their Unity Tour (with the Pet Shop Boys) on 17 September 2022. The tour consisted of 13 dates in the United States and Canada.
New Order kicked off their 2023 UK and European tour on 21 September 2023.

Other projects
In 1988, Bernard Sumner teamed up with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr to form the group Electronic, also enlisting the help of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys. Electronic regrouped in 1996 for Raise the Pressure, which also featured Karl Bartos (formerly of Kraftwerk). The project's third album Twisted Tenderness was released in 1999 after which the band dissolved.
In June 2009, Sumner formed a new band called Bad Lieutenant with Phil Cunningham (guitar) and Jake Evans (guitar and vocals). Their album Never Cry Another Tear was released on 5 October 2009. In addition to Cunningham and Evans the album also features appearances by Stephen Morris (drums), Jack Mitchell (drums), Tom Chapman (bass) and Alex James (bass). The live band included Morris on drums and Tom Chapman on bass.
Peter Hook has been involved with several other projects. In the 1990s, Hook recorded with Killing Joke with a view to joining the band. However, original bassist Martin 'Youth' Glover instead returned to the band. In 1995 he toured with the Durutti Column. He has recorded one album with the band Revenge with Davyth Hicks and Chris Jones and two with Monaco (both as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist) with David Potts. Monaco scored a club and alternative radio hit with ""What Do You Want From Me?"" in 1997. Hook also formed a band called Freebass with fellow bass players Mani (the Stone Roses) and Andy Rourke (the Smiths) in addition to vocalist Gary Briggs. Freebass was active from 2007 to 2010. He also contributed to Perry Farrell's Satellite Party. Hook's current band Peter Hook and the Light is touring and performing full albums from both Joy Division and New Order.
In 1990 Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris formed their own band, The Other Two. The Other Two released its first single ""Tasty Fish"" in 1991 and released two albums, The Other Two & You in 1993 and Super Highways in 1999. They have also been involved in scoring television soundtracks, like Making Out. In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remixes album Year Zero Remixed.

BeMusic
""BeMusic"" was a name the band used for their publishing company (the LP label for Movement says ""B Music"" in large letters, though using an italic ß for the letter B). All four members of the band used the name for production work for other artists' recordings between 1982 and 1985.
The first BeMusic credit was for Peter Hook producing Stockholm Monsters in 1982. Other artists with producer or musician credit for ""BeMusic"" were 52nd Street, Section 25, Marcel King, Quando Quango, Paul Haig, Thick Pigeon, Nyam Nyam, and Life.
Their production work as BeMusic was collected on two LTM Recordings compilation CDs, Cool As Ice: The BeMusic Productions and Twice As Nice (which also included production work by Donald Johnson, of A Certain Ratio, and Arthur Baker).

Influences, style and legacy
Some of New Order's tracks such as 1982's ""Temptation"", 1983's ""Blue Monday"" and 1987's ""True Faith"" can be observed blending genres of rock and dance. Founding member Hook stated that the band's shift from playing cold, dark tracks from 1981 to producing electro/rock tracks from 1982 was inspired by the music of German electronic group Kraftwerk, US rock band Sparks who had produced disco/electro-rock music with producer Giorgio Moroder on their No. 1 in Heaven album, and the Moroder/Donna Summer collaboration on ""I Feel Love"". Along with Kraftwerk, the English bands Cabaret Voltaire, the Human League, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) educated frontman Bernard Sumner that one ""could make music without guitars"". New Order's collaboration with New York DJ Arthur Baker was inspired by the records' sounds of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force.
According to a staff-written AllMusic history, the band are regarded as ""the first alternative dance"" music group, having ""fused icy, gloomy post-punk with Kraftwerk-style synth-pop"". They have also been labelled as synth-pop, post-punk, alternative rock, new wave, dance-rock, electronic rock, and electronica.
They have influenced techno, rock, and pop musicians including Moby, and were themselves influenced by the likes of David Bowie and Neu!. They have also influenced electro, freestyle and house.  New Order's Kraftwerk influence was acknowledged by their single ""Krafty"", which had cover art referencing ""Autobahn"".
Drummer Stephen Morris plays a mixture of acoustic and electronic drums, but all the band members could and did switch instruments throughout gigs, as evidenced on Jonathan Demme's video for ""The Perfect Kiss"" and the concert videos Taras Shevchenko (recorded in New York, November 1981) and Pumped Full of Drugs (Tokyo, May 1985). During such live gigs, Sumner alternated between guitar, keyboards, melodica, cowbell and (on the track ""Confusion"") bass; Gilbert switched between keyboards and guitar, Morris between drums and keyboards, and Hook played both bass and electronic drums. Taras Shevchenko is also notable for the fact all four members of the group have left the stage before the final song, ""Temptation"", comes to a complete end.

Reputation
Both New Order and Joy Division were among the most successful artists on the Factory Records label, which was run by Granada television personality Tony Wilson, and partnered with Factory in the financing of the Manchester club The Haçienda. Speaking in 2009, fellow synth-pop musician Phil Oakey described New Order's slow-burn career as cult musicians as being unusually prolonged and effective: ""If you want to make a lot of money out of pop, be number 3 a lot. Like New Order did.""

Cover artwork
Almost all New Order recordings have distinctive packaging and Peter Saville was the art director. The group's record sleeves bucked the 1980s trend by rarely showing the band members (with the exception of the Low-Life album) or even providing basic information such as the band name or title of the release. Song names were often hidden within the shrink wrapped package, either on the disc itself (such as the ""Blue Monday"" single), on an inconspicuous part of an inner sleeve (""The Perfect Kiss"" single), or written in a cryptic colour code invented by Saville (Power, Corruption & Lies). Saville said his intention was to sell the band as a ""mass-produced secret"" of sorts, and that the minimalist style was enough to allow fans to identify the band's products without explicit labelling. He frequently sent the artwork straight to the printer, unreviewed by either the band or the label. Their 1983 album, Power, Corruption & Lies, was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

Nicholas Gunn,"Nicholas Gunn is a classically trained songwriter, lyricist, and music producer. He is known for his originating instrumental works and his current works featuring vocalists from the electronic music space across Trance, Melodic House, and Chill. He is also the owner of Blue Dot Music, a record label and music publishing company.

Early life and education
Nicholas Graham Gunn was born in Rochester, Kent in South East England. He studied flute under a formal classical education from age seven till age eleven when his family moved to Southern California. After moving to Southern California Gunn continued his classical flute studies under private instruction. During junior high school and high school Gunn played wind ensemble in the band during concert season and drums and percussion during the marching season. After high school Gunn sidestepped music for a year, focusing his efforts towards modeling and acting which led to a small role on the national TV show Freddy's Nightmares as Monkey Puke Stone on season 2 episode 11 ""Dreams That Kill"".

Instrumental music career
Early on Gunn found himself immersed in a passion for recording his own instrumental style of music. Gunn shunned popular terms such as New Age and the connotation associated with his own music, preferring the term Instrumental or World Music. After unsuccessful attempts to obtain a recording deal from submissions, Gunn self-released his debut recording Afternoon in Sedona in 1992.  With national radio starting to escalate and CD sales starting to occur, Gunn received interest from nature retail chain Natural Wonders, which led him to a record deal with Sausalito, California-based instrumental music label Real Music.
Re-released under Real Music in 1993, Afternoon in Sedona became an instant best seller at national retail chains such as The Nature Company and Natural Wonders. It was his second album, The Sacred Fire, released in 1994, that first landed Gunn on the Billboard charts for New Age Album, where it ran for five weeks and peaked at number ten.
Taking part in Real Music's ""National Park Series"", Gunn's third album, The Music of the Grand Canyon, was released in 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies its first year. Once again Gunn found himself Top Ten on the Billboard charts and charted for fourteen weeks. Outside of Real Music and the ""National Park Series"", Gunn has gone on to release numerous albums influenced by the beauty of America's landscape and parks, such as Return to Grand Canyon (1999), Through the Great Smoky Mountains (2002), Journey to Yellowstone (2003), and Beyond Grand Canyon (2006). Beyond Grand Canyon was also released as a DVD, in which Gunn paired his musical compositions with photography of the Grand Canyon taken by Michael Fatali, creating a unique audio-visual experience.
On Crossroads, his fourth album released in 1996, Gunn began to incorporate a Latin influence into his sound, a theme which has subsequently embraced a number of his other albums, most notably Breathe (2004) and Encanto (2007), on which he collaborated with award-winning Latin guitarist Johannes Linstead. It was also on his 14th album, Thirty-One Nights, that he heavily incorporated this Latin influence working with Flamenco guitarist, Chris Fossek. Inspired by his trip to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the album also features Spanish spoken word.  Released on 11 September 2012, Thirty-One Nights charted No. 8 on the Billboard chart in its debut week. It was also chosen by John Diliberto and Echoes as one of the Top 25 Albums for October 2012.
Since 1991, Gunn has sold millions of copies of his instrumental music albums, an impressive feat considering that the marketing of his albums have mostly bypassed the traditional route of radio and mainstream outlets, finding large success through niche retail chains such as the Nature Company, Natural Wonders, and gift stores throughout the National Parks.
Gunn began combining his electronic sound with his instrumental roots in 2015 with the release of Under the Influence of Music. In his subsequent singles, Ibiza Sunset and Saint Lucia, one can hear his classic instrumental ""Nicholas Gunn"" sound moving into a more Ambient / Electronic space.
In 2018, Gunn continued this transition towards a more electronic sound and began introducing his own style of vocals and lyric writing. Older (feat. Alina Renae), released in 2018, showcases his first vocal-driven track under his Nicholas Gunn solo career. This was followed by the album, Riding the Thermals, which features four vocal tracks by the same vocalist. Riding the Thermals went on to peak at #6 on the USA iTunes Electronic Albums and #22 on Brazil's iTunes Best Selling Albums, amongst others. On April 24, 2020, Gunn continued to shape his vocal ambient/electronic sound with the release of his 20th studio recording, Pacific Blue, which again features four vocal tracks, also by Renae, and on February 12, 2021, he released Sound Condition, a compilation of 10 new songs, also featuring Renae's vocals.
In 2022, Gunn transcended genre by diversifying his release schedule with both ambient instrumentals on his own label, Blue Dot, all the while releasing vocal driven chill house works on Armada Music.
In 2023, Gunn turned his focus towards his label, Blue Dot Music, releasing all nine of his 2023 recordings on Blue Dot while also finding an equilibrium that has further defined Gunn as a genre blending artist successfully releasing ambient, chill house and trance music works under his Nicholas Gunn moniker.

Electronic music career
Gunn quickly immersed himself into electronic music by founding the musical act Limelght with then collaborator and partner, Tanner Wilfong. The duo released music under the moniker Limelght from 2017 through 2019 until the act was retired. In 2020 Gunn then began transitioning his ambient sound towards a more electronic House and Chill sound, featuring vocalists from around the globe. Gaining attention from electronic music label giant, Armada Music, Gunn expanded his reach and musical style by releasing music on this trend setting label. His track Higher with musical act York featuring world renowned vocalist Sam Martin as well as California featuring Chris Howard and Sensing You with AVIRA, all surpassed six million streams in 2022. Making a huge leap with his release schedule in 2022 Gunn released multiple new singles collaborating with artists such as Dave Neven, Derek Luttrell, RAEYA, Diana Miro, Protoculture, Jarod Glawe and Richard Durand with his collaboration, Love You More with Dave Neven, receiving #43 on the coveted A State of Trance top 50. Remixes from industry dance legends such as Richard Durand and Giuseppe Ottaviani have also gone on to become favorites on A State of Trance which is followed by over 40 million listeners per week.

Songwriter and lyricist career
Gunn has emerged as one of the leading songwriters and lyricists within the electronic music space, writing music behind the scenes for such renowned artists as Armin van Buuren, Aly & Fila, Luke Bond, Andrew Rayel, C-systems, Harshil Kamdar and many more. In 2021 Gunn's song, For All Time (feat Kazi Jay) was voted Tune of the Year by fans on A State of Trance.

Entrepreneur
In January 2019, after a hiatus from owning and operating his own label, Gunn saw an opportunity to remerge as a label owner and entrepreneur and started Blue Dot Music, a record label focused on songwriting, individuality and artistry. One of the labels' first releases, in 2019, was Gunn's own album Riding the Thermals. This was followed by the release of artist Little Warrior, and her album Lovesick, and then a single titled Time for Peace by artist Anna B May. Since then Blue Dot Music has gone to release hundreds of titles, experiencing rapid growth.
In 2020, Gunn released his album Pacific Blue which won several accolades including the Zone Music Reporter Best Chill/Groove Album of the year. In 2021 Gunn released Sound Condition which continued to express his continued desire to work with lyrics and vocalists.
In 2020, Blue Dot Music expanded upon its relationship with Sony The Orchard and entered into an exclusive publishing administration deal with Sony / ATV. Today, Blue Dot Studios continues to thrive publishing many releases each month.
In 2023, Blue Dot Music experienced 150 percent growth allowing it to expand into other music markets. Launching a trance imprint, Blue Dot Trance, its first four releases in 2023 charted on the Beatport Trance Top 100 and were supported by editorial playlists across all the major stores, Spotify, Apple and Amazon.

Philanthropist
Over the course of his career, Gunn has consistently monetarily contributed to the National Park systems. Along with record label Real Music, Gunn donated a portion of the proceeds from each sale of The Music of the Grand Canyon to the Grand Canyon Association. To date, in excess of $130,000 has been donated from sales. Gunn also named the American Lung Association as a beneficiary of a portion of sales from his album Breathe.

Nightnoise,"Nightnoise was a music ensemble active from 1984 to 1997. Their original blend of Irish traditional music, Celtic music, jazz, and classical chamber music inspired a generation of Irish musicians. They released seven albums on the Windham Hill label.

Origins
The origins of Nightnoise can be traced to the Bothy Band (disbanded in 1979), who made a name in Ireland and internationally with a lively fiddle-based sound that brought Irish music into the mainstream. One of the band's founders, guitarist Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, came from a long line of Irish musicians, and was considered one of the finest performers of traditional Irish music.
In 1983, after seven years with the Bothy Band and several years collaborating with the master fiddler Kevin Burke, Ó Domhnaill began searching for a new project and a new sound. He met Billy Oskay in Portland, Oregon, and the two began a new collaboration focused on a new and innovative music that integrated Celtic, jazz, and classical chamber music.
Billy Oskay was born in Kingston, New York, and had developed an international reputation as a violinist. He started playing violin at seven and went on to study under Eugen Prokop at the International Academy of Music Palma de Mallorca in Spain. He excelled equally in violin technique and composition. He graduated from the esteemed academy with a degree in violin and chamber music.
Nightnoise began as a collaboration between this American violinist and Irish guitarist who sought to create a unique blend of musical forms. Together, they composed and recorded some songs in Oskay's Portland home and were pleased with the result. Ó Domhnaill secured a contract with William Ackerman at Windham Hill Records, the tracks they recorded were mixed and released in 1984 under the title Nightnoise. The album represented a real departure from Ó Domhnaill's Bothy Band roots, and the mellow, ambient instrumental style incorporating jazz and classical elements and forms full of spirituality almost defined what would be called New Age music.

1987–1990
Three years later, Mícheál's sister, Irish pianist and vocalist Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill, who performed with her brother in Skara Brae, Relativity, and the Bothy Band, and Irish-American flutist Brian Dunning joined the original duo. Nightnoise, the band, was born. The quartet's first album Something of Time, was released by Windham Hill in 1987. It was followed by At the End of the Evening (1988), The Parting Tide (1990). This would be the last album to feature the playing and writing of Billy Oskay, who chose to follow his dream of owning his own recording studio, Big Red Studio.

1991–1997
Following Oskay's departure, Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham, a former member of Silly Wizard who had played with Tríona and Mícheál in the band Relativity, took over Oskay's duties. The band took on a much more Irish-centric sound, while still retaining their own signature style. The revamped Nightnoise went on to release the albums Shadow of Time (1994), A Different Shore (1995), and The White Horse Sessions (1997), an album featuring live concert performances mixed in with in-studio live performances, with their Windham Hill colleagues as their audience. The album also featured original material only available in this live format (the songs ""Heartwood"", ""Do We"", and ""Murdo of the Moon""), as well as a cover of Van Morrison's classic ""Moondance"". This album marked the end of the band's contractual obligations to Windham Hill, and they decided to relocate to Ireland, going on hiatus while they each focused on their own projects.

1997–2003
The White Horse Sessions proved to be the last Nightnoise album. Cunningham left the band following its release, and was replaced by Irish fiddler John Fitzpatrick. In a 1999 interview, Mícheál Ó Domhnaill stated that Nightnoise had not broken up, and that the band would be getting together again shortly. The band did indeed record new material from 1997 to 2002 (both original compositions and covers of classic songs), but they were all made for albums other than their own. Nightnoise officially disbanded towards the end of 2003.
Johnny Cunningham died on 15 December 2003, from a heart attack. He was 46 years old. Mícheál Ó Domhnaill died from a heart attack in July 2006 at his home in Dublin, Ireland, at the age of 54.
Dunning died on 10 February 2022, at the age of 70.

Nine Inch Nails,"Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN, stylized as 
NIN, is an American industrial rock band formed in Cleveland in 1988. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, Atticus Ross, joined in 2016. The band's debut album, Pretty Hate Machine (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The following albums, The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.
Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album With Teeth (2005). Following the release of the next album Year Zero (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released Ghosts I–IV (2008) and The Slip (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, Hesitation Marks (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs Not the Actual Events (2016) and Add Violence (2017) and their ninth album Bad Witch (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further installments in the Ghosts series: Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.
When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.
Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs ""Wish"" in 1992 and ""Happiness in Slavery"" in 1996. Time magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while Spin magazine has described him as ""the most vital artist in music"". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.

History
Formation (1987–1988)
While living in Cleveland in 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synthpop band managed by John Malm Jr.: 38  Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than ""a little wear on [his] tape heads"". Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, Reznor was inspired by Prince to play all instruments himself except drums, which he programmed electronically. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since.
The first Nine Inch Nails performance took place at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio, on October 21, 1988. Soon after, following their live support of Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as Purest Feeling, were released in revised form on the first studio album, Pretty Hate Machine (1989).: 41  The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples.
Reznor chose the name ""Nine Inch Nails"" because it ""abbreviated easily"" rather than for ""any literal meaning"". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to reference Jesus' crucifixion with nine-inch spikes,: 57  or Freddy Krueger's nine-inch fingernails. The Nine Inch Nails logo first appeared on the music video for their debut single, ""Down in It"". Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the logo, inspired by Tibor Kalman's typography on the Talking Heads album Remain in Light. The logo features the band's initials, with the second N mirrored. Talpas, a native of Cleveland, continued to design Nine Inch Nails packaging until 1997.

Pretty Hate Machine (1988–1991)
Written, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album Pretty Hate Machine debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with Adrian Sherwood (who produced the lead single ""Down in It"" in London without meeting Reznor face-to-face) and Mark ""Flood"" Ellis.: 42  Reznor asked Sean Beavan to mix the demos of Pretty Hate Machine, which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Sin"". Rolling Stone's Michael Azerrad described the album as ""industrial-strength noise over a pop framework"" and ""harrowing but catchy music""; Reznor proclaimed this combination ""a sincere statement"" of ""what was in [his] head at the time"". In fact, the song ""Down in It"" spent over two months on Billboard's club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the Billboard 200, Pretty Hate Machine became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification.

Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. MTV aired the videos for ""Down in It"" and ""Head Like a Hole"", but an explicit video for ""Sin"" was only released in partial form for Closure. The original version of the ""Down in It"" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the FBI.
In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked what shows they would like to appear on. They jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.
In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, in which it toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and the Jesus and Mary Chain.: 41  Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.: 42

Broken (1992–1993)
After a poor European reception opening for Guns N' Roses, the band returned to the US amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine. After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with Interscope Records and created Nothing Records:

We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.: 42 
In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed ""Le Pig"" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's ""family"" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends.: 42  The band used it to record Broken, an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized Broken as a guitar-based ""blast of destruction"", and as ""a lot harder ... than Pretty Hate Machine"". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from Broken earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single ""Happiness in Slavery"" from Woodstock '94, and the second single ""Wish"". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for ""Wish"", Reznor joked that ""Wish"" became ""the only song to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics."" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.: 42 
Peter Christopherson of the bands Coil and Throbbing Gristle directed a performance video for ""Wish"", but the EP's most controversial video accompanied ""Happiness in Slavery"". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of performance artist Bob Flanagan disrobed and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then (apparently) kills him. A third video for ""Pinion"", partially incorporated into MTV's Alternative Nation opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in bondage. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for ""Help Me I Am in Hell"" and ""Gave Up"" into a longform music video titled Broken. It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for ""Gave Up"" featuring Richard Patrick and Marilyn Manson was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of ""Wish"" was also filmed, and both videos appeared in Closure.
Broken was followed by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of ""Last"", produced by Butch Vig (the outro of the ""Last"" remix is heard in ""Throw This Away"", which also includes Reznor's remix of ""Suck""). The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11 kHz file, ""NIN_LAST.AIFF"", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256 kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying ""I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.""

The Downward Spiral (1993–1997)
Early ideas for The Downward Spiral arose after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival's concerts ended in September. Reznor elaborated the album's themes into lyrics.: 42  Despite initially choosing to record the album in New Orleans, Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, in Los Angeles (known as the Manson Murder House) renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, the start of the making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral.
Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and is the band's highest seller in the US, over four million copies, among five million worldwide. Influenced by Pink Floyd and by David Bowie of the 1970s, The Downward Spiral's diverse textures and moods depict a protagonist's mental progress. Flood co-produced several tracks, while Alan Moulder mixed most, and later found more extensive production duties on future albums. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on The Downward Spiral. After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as ""Closer"", Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar in 1996. The Downward Spiral, alike Broken, was recorded at Le Pig Studios. ""March of the Pigs"" and ""Closer"" were singles. Two other tracks, ""Hurt"" and ""Piggy"", though not singles, were issued to radio. Also in 1994, the band released the promotional single ""Burn"", which Reznor produced, on the soundtrack of Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. as well as a cover of the Joy Division song ""Dead Souls"" on the soundtrack to the film The Crow, which went to number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.
The music video for ""Closer"", directed by Mark Romanek, was in MTV's frequent rotation, although the network, deeming it too graphic, heavily censored the original. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.: 96 
Contemporary critics generally praised The Downward Spiral, now classed among the most important albums of the 1990s. In 2005, Spin ranked it 25th among the ""100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005"". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it 200 among ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". Blender named it the 80th Greatest American Album. It was ranked No. 488 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time by Martin Popoff. In 2001 Q named The Downward Spiral as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time; in 2010 the album was ranked No. 102 on their 250 Best Albums of Q's Lifetime (1986–2011) list. After The Downward Spiral's release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled Further Down the Spiral, the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States and among the best-selling remix albums of all time. It contained contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, among others.
After The Downward Spiral's 1994 release, the live band supported it by embarking on the Self Destruct Tour. The stage set-up featured dirty curtains, rising and lowering for visuals shown during songs such as ""Hurt"". The tour debuted the band's grungy, messy image as the members appeared in ragged attire slathered in corn starch. Performances were violent and chaotic, band members often injuring themselves by attacking each other, diving into the crowd, and destroying their instruments to close. The widest mainstream audience was a mud-soaked performance at Woodstock '94, and seen by Pay-Per-View in up to 24 million homes. Enjoying mainstream success thereafter, Nine Inch Nails then performed amid greater production values, adding theatrical visual elements. Supporting acts on tour included the Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the Closure video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of ""Eraser"", ""Hurt"" and a one-take ""March of the Pigs"" clip directed by Peter Christoperson. In 1997 Reznor also produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film Lost Highway, which featured one new Nine Inch Nails song, ""The Perfect Drug"". Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of The Fragile.

The Fragile (1998–2002)
Five years elapsed between The Downward Spiral and Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, The Fragile, which arrived as a double album in September 1999. The Fragile was conceived by making ""songwriting and arranging and production and sound design ... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song."" Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he ""provided final continuity and flow.""
On the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded The Fragile more than a year before its release, when it was already described as ""oft-delayed"". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. Spin hailed The Fragile as the ""album of the year"", whereas Pitchfork Media panned its ""melodramatic"" lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: ""The Day the World Went Away"" in North America; ""We're in This Together"" in the EU and Japan (on three separate discs); and ""Into the Void"" in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the Billboard Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the biggest drop from number one, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.
Before the album's release, the song ""Starfuckers, Inc."" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. Cinesexuality critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a ""scathing attack on the alternative music scene,"" particularly Reznor's former friend and protégé Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled ""Starsuckers, Inc."" and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden in 2000.
Reznor followed The Fragile with another remix album, Things Falling Apart, released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 Fragility tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as And All That Could Have Been. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc Still, containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.
During the Fragility 2.0 tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober.
In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"" for his album, American IV: The Man Comes Around, to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition:

I pop the video in, and wow ... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps ... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore ... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning—different, but every bit as pure.

With Teeth (2004–2006)
A further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album. With Teeth was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted on top of the Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date.
Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield described the album as ""vintage Nine Inch Nails"". PopMatters condemned the album, claiming Reznor ""ran out of ideas.""

A music video for the song ""The Hand That Feeds"" premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in GarageBand format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album's second single ""Only"" in a wider range of formats, including Pro Tools and ACID Pro. David Fincher directed a video for ""Only"" with primarily computer-generated imagery. The planned music video for its third single, ""Every Day Is Exactly the Same"", was directed by Francis Lawrence but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.
Nine Inch Nails launched a North American arena tour in Autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux and Death from Above 1979. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist Saul Williams, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The Beside You in Time tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The home video release debuted at number one on both the Billboard Top Music Videos and Billboard Comprehensive Music Videos charts in the United States.

Year Zero (2006–2007)
Nine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, Year Zero, was released on April 17, 2007, only two years after With Teeth, a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Year Zero is a concept album criticizing the United States government's policies and their impact on the world 15 years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on Metacritic.
The story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed ""Year 0"", by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.
An alternate reality game emerged parallel to the Year Zero concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an ""Orwellian picture of the United States circa the year 2022"". Before Year Zero's release, unreleased songs from the album were found on USB drives hidden at Nine Inch Nails concert venues in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the alternate reality game caught the attention of media outlets such as USA Today and Billboard, who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries.
The album's first single, ""Survivalism"", and other tracks from Year Zero were released as multitrack audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled Year Zero Remixed was later released, containing remixes from Year Zero by other artists. The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes.
Reznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted Year Zero as ""part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist."" The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for Year Zero as a film, then Reznor found American film producer Lawrence Bender and met with writers.
On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: ""We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens."" Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the 2007–2008 Writer's Guild strike, but it nevertheless continued. In 2010, the resultant miniseries, also named Year Zero, was reported to be in development with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf, but at the end of 2012 Reznor said that the project was ""in a holding state"".

Ghosts I–IV and The Slip (2008–2012)
In February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled ""2 weeks"". On March 2, Ghosts I–IV (the first release on The Null Corporation label), a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band's official website. Ghosts I–IV was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days. The album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike licence. The album was created improvisationally over a 10-week period and contributors included Atticus Ross, Alan Moulder, Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione.
Similar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of Ghosts I–IV, a post on the band's website in April 2008 read ""2 weeks!"" On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released The Slip via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, ""this one's on me,"" protected under the same Creative Commons licence as Ghosts, and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4 million. The Slip has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000.
Since the release of Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, a 25-date tour titled Lights in the Sky, was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of Ilan Rubin on drums.
On January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 GB via BitTorrent. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional 3-part digital film, followed by a physical release created ""by fans for fans"". This tour documentary became collectively known as Another Version of the Truth and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as USA Today, Rolling Stone, Techdirt and Pitchfork TV, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster Rob Sheridan noted on the band's official website:

This is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.
Nine Inch Nails Revenge, an iPhone/iPod Touch-exclusive rhythm game developed by Tapulous, was released on March 8, 2009 (five months after the company announced the development of the game). This installment in the Tap Tap video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from Ghosts I–IV and The Slip. Portions of the album Ghosts I-IV were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary Citizenfour.
In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that ""I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while."" Reznor since clarified that he ""isn't done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future."" The ""Wave Goodbye"" tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man, and a cover of U2's ""Zoo Station"", included in the Achtung Baby tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered.
In 2009 Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig, and formed a project with Maandig and Atticus Ross dubbed How to Destroy Angels. Its first release, a six-track self-titled EP, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor's next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the official score for David Fincher's 2010 film, The Social Network. Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture, and a 2010 Oscar for Best Original Score. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher's 2014 film Gone Girl.
In July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer Treyarch to compose the theme music for Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with Alessandro Cortini on a remix of the song ""Destroyer"" by Telepathe. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called ""Sound City"" directed by Dave Grohl, in addition to co-writing and performing the song ""Mantra"" with Grohl and Josh Homme. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from Queens of the Stone Age titled ...Like Clockwork. Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song ""Kalopsia"" and vocals on ""Fairweather Friends"" along with Elton John on piano and vocals. In October a project with Dr. Dre and Beats Electronics was announced that Reznor wrote was ""probably not what you're expecting [from me]"". The project was named ""Daisy""; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer.

Hesitation Marks (2012–2014)
In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails ""in mind"". Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the Twenty Thirteen Tour. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction, Adrian Belew of King Crimson, and Josh Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place.
By May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, Hesitation Marks incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist Pino Palladino along with  Todd Rundgren and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham to achieve various art-rock elements.

The album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. ""Came Back Haunted"" was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an epileptic seizure warning. The second single, ""Copy of A"", was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK Amazon.com account holders. ""Everything"" was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album.
In July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the Fuji Rock Festival, and the Pukkelpop, Hockenheim, Germany's Rock'n'Heim and the Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky as opening acts. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013.
In 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by Queens of the Stone Age for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act Cold Cave. After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks prior to the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, the Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the tour.
In 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted.
In June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of The Fragile and With Teeth to stream exclusively on Apple Music, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started ""messing around with some things"" in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating ""It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting"". In December 2015, Reznor reported that ""Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016"".

The Trilogy (Not the Actual Events / Add Violence / Bad Witch) (2016–2019)
In October 2016, in response to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with ""2016 is not over yet"". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: ""Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? ... Just wait and see what happens."" Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.
In early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the Panorama Music Festival in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official Facebook page that it would be headlining Day 3 of FYF Fest in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced their 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band's 2014 touring lineup, Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. The band appeared in Part 8 of the third season of Twin Peaks, performing their song, ""She's Gone Away"".
In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that Not the Actual Events would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment Add Violence being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single ""Less Than"" was released a week prior to the second EP's release.
Also in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming Ken Burns series The Vietnam War, and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. 
The band released their ninth studio album, Bad Witch, on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the ""Cold and Black and Infinite 2018 North America Tour"", where it toured with the Jesus and Mary Chain. To prevent ticket scalping, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision ""The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We've decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way.""
In October 2019, Nine Inch Nails was again nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

Ghosts V–VI (2020–present)
On January 15, 2020, Nine Inch Nails were officially named as members of the Class of 2020 for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the induction ceremony was postponed indefinitely. Originally, only Trent Reznor was to be inducted as the sole full-time member of the group for most of its history. After holding discussions with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Reznor announced that former live band members Chris Vrenna and Danny Lohner, as well as current members Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin (the youngest person ever inducted into the Hall of Fame), longtime guitarist Robin Finck, and the only other full time member of the band, Atticus Ross, would all be inducted as members of Nine Inch Nails.
On March 26, 2020, Nine Inch Nails released Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, their tenth and eleventh studio albums and the sequels to their 2008 instrumental album Ghosts I–IV. The albums were released for free as a show of solidarity with the band's fans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the pandemic, the live induction ceremony for the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction was cancelled on July 15, 2020, and simultaneously, an induction special was announced to be broadcast and available for streaming through HBO and HBO Max, respectively, on November 7, 2020. In the interim, a special display was created to represent Nine Inch Nails' presence in the Hall of Fame that celebrated their popular, muddy performance at Woodstock '94; opened on the 26th anniversary of the concert. On November 6, 2020, Trent Reznor and the other to-be-inducted members of Nine Inch Nails were interviewed by journalist David Farrier about the history of the band and their feelings on being inducted. Then on November 7, Nine Inch Nails was formally inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, by punk icon Iggy Pop. Reznor thanked the fans, his family, and all of his many Nine Inch Nails collaborators in his acceptance speech, recorded from his home in Beverly Hills, CA.
On May 6, 2021, Nine Inch Nails released a new track, ""Isn't Everyone"" in collaboration with noise rock group HEALTH, who had previously been an opening act on their Lights In The Sky and Wave Goodbye tours. On May 7, they announced they would be playing two shows in Cleveland (September 21 and 23, 2021) with the Pixies to commemorate their inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which, according to the band, would be ""the only NIN headline shows in 2021"". Those shows were cancelled on August 19, 2021, due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. Also in 2021, Reznor and Ross produced Halsey's album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power. It was later nominated for the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.
In February 2022, Nine Inch Nails announced a short tour of the United States for 2022, the group's first performances in nearly four years. A tour of the United Kingdom was announced shortly afterwards.
On September 24, 2022, Nine Inch Nails performed in their native Cleveland for the first time since 2013 after a ""Nine Inch Nails Fan Day"" at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame the previous day. Over the course of the performance, all the other six inductees, as well as former members Richard Patrick and Charlie Clouser, joined Reznor on stage and even covered Patrick's Filter hit, ""Hey Man Nice Shot"". Reznor posted on his Discord after the show, “When/If we tour again, it will be different. Not like [2018′s “Cold Black Infinite” tour] era – It's over.”

Music and lyrics
Nine Inch Nails has been described as incorporating alternative rock, industrial rock, industrial dance, industrial, electro-industrial, industrial metal, electronic rock, and alternative metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that ""Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience"". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term ""industrial"" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in Spin magazine that ""Down in It"" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song ""Dig It""; other songs from Pretty Hate Machine and With Teeth have been described as synth-pop.: 35  Reviewing The Fragile, critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in ""The Frail"" and drum and bass elements in ""Starfuckers, Inc."" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on Ghosts I–IV (which is specifically dark ambient), Hesitation Marks, The Downward Spiral, The Slip, and The Fragile.

Songs such as ""Wish"" and ""The Day the World Went Away"" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in ""Starfuckers, Inc."" and ""Burn"". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in ""The Collector"" from With Teeth and concert favorite ""March of the Pigs"". Reznor uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song ""Hurt"", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word ""I"" every time the B/E# dyad is played. ""Closer"" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: the melody is debuted during the second verse of ""Piggy"" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of ""Heresy"", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout ""A Warm Place"", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on ""The Downward Spiral"".
On The Fragile, Reznor revisits the technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long ""The Great Destroyer"". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: ""Guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken."" Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, and nihilism. Occasionally, the lyrics depart from their introspective nature to deal with a topic like politics, which is the focus of Year Zero. Three Nine Inch Nails albums are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, The Fragile, and Year Zero. The album With Teeth was originally set to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.

Influences
Nine Inch Nails' earliest influence was the punk rock band the Clash; Reznor stated that he started out trying to directly imitate them, only to abandon that direction due to his lack of a political message. Other early influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, which helped shape 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. The album's liner notes also paid tribute to  Public Enemy and Prince. Another large influence on the band's sound is Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that ""after hearing 'Cars' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers"". The 2005 single ""Only"" exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails include acts such as Depeche Mode, Queen, King Crimson, Devo, the Cure, Joy Division, U2, Bauhaus, Adam Ant, Coil, and Soft Cell.
Reznor has toured with some of his influences, including a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1988. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who, along with Pink Floyd, had been a significant influence on The Downward Spiral. In 2006, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with Bauhaus, on their Summer Amphitheatre Tour.

Legacy
Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from ""generic imitations"" dating from his initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a ""truer, less imitative way"". Following the release of The Downward Spiral, mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared Reznor's impact to that of The Velvet Underground. Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose was influenced heavily by Nine Inch Nails in changing his band's sound to an industrial style in the mid-90's. Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a ""true visionary"" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. Nine Inch Nails has been credited by music journalists for popularizing industrial music, despite ambivalence from Reznor.
The act has received four awards from 25 nominations, including two Grammy Awards for the songs ""Wish"" and ""Happiness in Slavery"" in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Nine Inch Nails have received two Kerrang! Awards; one of them being the Kerrang! Icon in 2006, honoring the band's overall contributions since 1988 and long-standing influence on rock music. The band has also received nine nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards for several of its videos, including two nominations for the ""Closer"" music video and five nominations for ""The Perfect Drug"" music video, including Video of the Year.
In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin described him as ""the most vital artist in music"". The Recording Industry Association of America certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States, which accounted for roughly half of the band's reported sales worldwide at that time. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine placed The Downward Spiral at No. 200 in a 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and by the following year ranked Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 in their The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.
In 2019, Reznor and Ross received songwriting and production credits for the number-one single ""Old Town Road"" by Lil Nas X, which sampled their track ""34 Ghosts IV"" from Ghosts I–IV. ""Old Town Road"" broke the record for most consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. As producers for the song, Reznor and Ross won a CMA Award for the 'Musical Event of the Year', along with Lil Nas X, featured artist Billy Ray Cyrus and producer YoungKio.
In January 2020, after previous nominations in 2014 and 2015, Nine Inch Nails (Alessandro Cortini, Robin Finck, Danny Lohner, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, Ilan Rubin and Chris Vrenna) were named as inductees of the 2020 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Corporate disputes
TVT Records
In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.
At the behest of Prudential Securities bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including Pretty Hate Machine, and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. Rykodisc, which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print Pretty Hate Machine CD on November 22, 2005. Ryko also reissued the ""Head Like a Hole"" CD and a vinyl edition of Pretty Hate Machine in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for The Downward Spiral. They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.

Universal Music Group
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of Universal Music Group (parent company of Nine Inch Nails' record label, Interscope Records) for its pricing and distribution plans for Year Zero. He labeled the company's retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia as ""ABSURD"", concluding that ""as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off"". Reznor went on to say that he hated Interscope, and in later years the ""climate"" of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to ""steal"" his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to ""steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealing"".
Reznor announced on October 8, 2007, that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a ""totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label"". Reznor also speculated that he would release the next Nine Inch Nails album online in a similar fashion to The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, which he produced. Reznor later released the first nine tracks of Ghosts I–IV and the entirety of The Slip in 2008 for free download.
In another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential ""accusation"", in Reznor's words, ""that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for"". Reznor wrote in response that he was ""challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other's feet"". Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched in November 2007.

Other corporations
Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of ""The Hand That Feeds"". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: ""Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me."" MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was ""uncomfortable"" with the performance being ""built around partisan political statements"". A performance by Foo Fighters replaced Nine Inch Nails' time slot on the show. During the Lights in the Sky tour in 2008, some performances of ""The Hand that Feeds"" had the image of Bush on a video screen behind the band. At some gigs leading up to the election, the face of Bush slowly morphed during the song into the face of John McCain.
Another ceremony incident had occurred at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014. The band performed ""Copy of A"" and ""My God Is the Sun"" with Queens of the Stone Age, Lindsey Buckingham, and Dave Grohl towards the end of the broadcast; however, the performance was not shown in full to the audience at home as advertisements had cut-in midway through the second song. Despite an apology from producer Kenneth Ehrlich, Reznor later heavily criticized the situation.
In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a cease and desist to Fox News Channel for using three songs from The Fragile on air without permission. The songs ""La Mer"", ""The Great Below"", and ""The Mark Has Been Made"" appeared in an episode of War Stories with Oliver North detailing the battle of Iwo Jima. A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: ""Thanks for the Fox News heads-up. A cease and desist has been issued. FUCK Fox Fucking News.""
As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of Year Zero, three tracks from the album were intentionally ""leaked"" prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on USB flash drives. The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the Recording Industry Association of America, despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label. The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, ""These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on.""
The music of Nine Inch Nails has reportedly been used by the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message on the front page of the Nine Inch Nails website: ""It's difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration's reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us.""
Aside from disagreements over the usage of Nine Inch Nails material, some corporations have dismissed content due to perceived obscenity. In 2009, Apple rejected an update to Nine Inch Nails' iPhone application, NIN: Access, because it found The Downward Spiral to contain ""offensive or obscene content"", referring to the lyrical content. Reznor criticized their decision, citing the audio was also available through the iTunes application.
A similar incident involving digital content distribution occurred in 2013 when Nine Inch Nails re-released the original 1993 film Broken on Vimeo. Within hours of launch, the video was removed due to terms of service violation on material that ""harass, incite hatred or depict excessive violence"".

Live performances
Until Atticus Ross joined in 2016, Reznor was the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, Reznor typically forms a backing group of musicians to perform the songs in a live setting. This live band, also known as Nine Inch Nails, rearranges the band's studio catalog and creates a different sound than that of Reznor's studio recordings. Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor.
The Tapeworm project was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more ""democratic"" creative environment. The band initially included live band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser, but eventually expanded to include other frequent Nine Inch Nails contributors Josh Freese, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder. However, after 9 years of studio sessions, no material was ever officially released from the group, and it was confirmed to be no longer active in 2005.
The lineup of the live band had a tendency to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band have remained constant since its formation. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.

Nine Inch Nails at Curlie"
No-Man,"No-Man are an English art pop duo, formed in 1987 as No Man Is an Island (Except the Isle of Man) by singer Tim Bowness and multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson. The band has so far produced seven studio albums and a number of singles/outtakes collections (including 2006's career retrospective All the Blue Changes). The band was once lauded as ""conceivably the most important English group since The Smiths"" by Melody Maker music newspaper, and a 2017 article of Drowned in Sound described them as ""probably the most underrated band of the last 25 years"".
Originally creating a sample-based proto-trip hop/ambient/electropop-styled music, No-Man has pursued a more organic, diverse and band-oriented sound in subsequent years. Drawing from a diverse mix of singer-songwriter, post rock, minimalist, progressive rock, jazz and contemporary ambient sources for inspiration, No-Man's musical style is distinctive yet difficult to categorise.

History
Formation (1986–1989)
Steven Wilson originally launched the band in 1986 as a solo project called ""No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man)"", recording an instrumental track called ""From a Toyshop Window"", which blended progressive rock with synth pop. In 1987, he linked up with singer, lyricist and occasional guitarist and keyboard player Tim Bowness, who at the time was singing with Liverpool-based art-pop band, Plenty (not to be confused with the more recent Japanese indie rock band, Plenty).
Bowness and Wilson continued working together on recording sessions for the next two years. Violinist Ben Coleman joined the project after becoming involved with recording sessions in late 1988. The band established a four-piece live line-up in 1989 by adding guitarist Stuart Blagden (who had previously played with Bowness in the Manchester-based band, Still).
No Man Is An Island released their debut single, a waltz time ballad called ""The Girl From Missouri"", on Plastic Head Records in mid-1989. The band was disappointed with the single and soon disowned it. Subsequent band evolutions saw flirtations with aggressive synth-pop (on the ""Swagger"" cassette EP) and the departure of Blagden (who would later become a jazz and Latin music player).

No-Man's pop years (1990–1994)
By 1990, No Man Is an Island had shortened their name to No-Man and become a voice/violin/guitar-and-tapes trio (with Wilson handling all other instruments and programming in the studio).
The first release under the No-Man name was the self-pressed June 1990 single release, ""Colours"" (a cover of the 1960s Donovan Leich song with crooned vocals and a dub-loop arrangement anticipating the later arrival of trip hop). The single achieved Melody Maker, Sounds and Channel 4 teletext ""Singles of the Week"" accolades and was re-released by Liverpool-based label Probe Plus in October, 1990.
The attention which ""Colours"" had received led to No-Man being signed by Dave Massey to a long-term music publishing songwriting agreement with independent Hit & Run Music Publishing. Massey soon secured a recording contract with the independent label One Little Indian. During this period, the band received highly positive UK music media support (including more Singles of the Week in Melody Maker, Sounds and Irish music paper, Hot Press) and had 2 indie top 20 hits (""Days in the Trees"" and ""Ocean Song"") plus a Billboard Top 40 dance hit (the US only single, ""Taking It Like A Man"", at No. 34).
No-Man’s debut mini-album (a compilation of EP tracks called Lovesighs - An Entertainment) was released in April 1992, and in October of the same year the band toured England with a six-piece line-up including three ex-members of the band Japan – Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and (most significantly) keyboardist Richard Barbieri, who had been recruited by Massey. The band's first full-length album (the more pop-oriented Loveblows & Lovecries - A Confession) followed in May 1993. By this time, the live band included bass player Silas Maitland and the (unrelated) drummer Chris Maitland. (The latter would join both Wilson and Richard Barbieri in the live lineup of Porcupine Tree).
In 1994 No-Man released their second album Flowermouth.  Although the band parted company with violinist Ben Coleman during the sessions, he made a significant contribution towards most of the tracks on the record. No-Man also stopped performing live in 1994, and would not return to the stage until 2006.

The move towards art-rock (1995–2000)
Two albums released in 1995 closed the first phase of the band's career - a set of ambient dance reworkings of Flowermouth material called Flowermix and a compilation of the band's more ambient and atmospheric One Little Indian-era B-sides and rarities called Heaven Taste.
With each subsequent release the band moved further away from its more conventional pop and rock roots, mirroring the evolution of artists such as Talk Talk, David Sylvian, Radiohead, Scott Walker and Kate Bush. Since the mid-1990s, No-Man has released a steady stream of albums via Snapper Music and 3rd Stone/Adasam, featuring guests such as Fripp, Barbieri, Jansen, Theo Travis and Pat Mastellotto. The band has maintained a healthy cult following as well as continued critical acclaim.
1996's Wild Opera and its 1997 companion release Dry Cleaning Ray (both released on 3rd Stone Ltd.) explored a combination of darker dance sounds, experimental art-rock and deep trip hop, while maintaining No-Man's particular skill with ballads. An EP of all-new material, Carolina Skeletons, followed in 1998.
In 1999, the band released Speak, a compilation of mostly-unreleased early ambient songs recorded a decade previously but which Bowness and Wilson considered to be of equal merit to the music released on One Little Indian or 3rd Stone Ltd.

Organic balladeers (2000–2018)
Speak's quieter and more atmospheric approach pointed the way towards No-Man's subsequent output. 2001's Returning Jesus (the last album to be released on 3rd Stone Ltd.) resurrected and expanded the eclectic ballad, jazz and progressive rock influences of Flowermouth and brought the band to a new and revived audience, some of whom had come in via the continued success of Wilson's other main project Porcupine Tree.
Signing a new deal with Snapper Music, the band went on to release Together We're Stranger in 2003 - a sombre, moving record with strong tone poem elements detailing (in abstract) the break-up of a relationship and responses to bereavement.
In 2006, No-Man made a rare live performance at the Norwich Garage (part of a Burning Shed label event).
The band released Schoolyard Ghosts on 12 May 2008, receiving some of the most favourable reviews of the band's career (the album was described as ""truly sublime"" by Classic rock magazine). Guest musicians included Pat Mastelotto, Theo Travis, Gavin Harrison, Colin Edwin, Bruce Kaphan (ex-American Music Club) and The London Session Orchestra (arranged by Dave Stewart).
On 27 May 2008, it was announced that No-Man's music will be featured in the film by award-winning student film-maker Dan Faltz, Weak Species. The film is based on the writings of Dennis Cooper and is currently being considered for expanded feature film treatment.
No-Man played its first full performance in fifteen years at London's Bush Hall on 29 August 2008,. This performance was followed by two more concerts in Zoetermeer (The Netherlands) and Düsseldorf (Germany) on 3 and 4 September respectively. The Zoetermeer concert was No-Man's first concert outside of the UK.
Mixtaped—a double DVD package including a film of the sell-out London performance, a documentary of the group's history and assorted promotional videos—was released in October 2009. Early releases of the DVD ordered from Burning Shed included an audio CD recording of highlights from the Bush Hall show. The DVD was voted No. 5 in the Classic Rock Presents Prog 2010 critic's poll.
On 22 December 2011, the band announced through their Facebook page that a new live recording, titled Love and Endings, recorded at the Leamington Spa Assembly in October 2011 would be released on 27 February 2012. It was followed by a 5-date tour, including first performance in Poland on 26 August 2012.

Return to synth-pop roots (2019-present)
Wilson announced in late 2018 that he was working with Bowness on a new No-Man album, the band's first full length album of original material since 2008's Schoolyard Ghosts. Wilson described the album as ""music that in many ways sees a return to our roots as a synth-pop band, albeit with the conceptual sweep of our more recent albums"".
In September 2019 the band announced their new album, Love You to Bits, which was released on 22 November 2019.

Omar Rodríguez-López,"Omar Alfredo Rodríguez-López (born September 1, 1975) is a Puerto Rican guitarist and songwriter. He has formed or played in several bands, including The Mars Volta, At the Drive-In, Antemasque, and Bosnian Rainbows. He was the bassist for the dub band De Facto. He has embarked on a solo career, both in studio and in concert, frequently described as experimental, avant-garde, or progressive. He has also collaborated with numerous artists, such as Damo Suzuki, John Frusciante, El-P, Mon Laferte and Calle 13.

Biography
Rodríguez-López was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in El Paso, Texas, and spent some of his childhood in South Carolina. He began playing the bass at age 12, but then switched to guitar at 15 because he ""needed more strings"". It was during this time that Rodríguez-López met Cedric Bixler-Zavala while practicing with friend Paul Hinojos. Since then Rodríguez-López has spent most of his career living and working with his close friend Bixler-Zavala. During this time he frequently collaborated with his friends and future bandmates from El Paso, which included people such as Paul Hinojos, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Julio Venegas and the late Jeremy Ward. He attended Coronado High School in El Paso. He says he enjoys the company of his close friends and family when not fulfilling obligations to his many bands and projects. Rodríguez-López has been a vegetarian for most of his life.

Startled Calf (1991–1992)
Rodriguez-López dropped out of high school at age 17 to go on tour with Startled Calf, an El Paso, Texas, hardcore punk band, as their vocalist, and was left stranded in Berkeley after the rest of the band were arrested. The band formed in 1991 and featured Ralph Jasso on guitar, Jimmy Hernandez on bass, and George Fraska on drums. The band broke up in 1992. Hernandez died of cancer some time after.

At the Drive-In (1995–2001, 2012, 2016–2018)
At 17, Rodríguez-López left El Paso to hitchhike around the country for a year in the early 1990s, during which he acquired an addiction to opiates. Eventually he got in touch with friend Cedric Bixler-Zavala who suggested he come back to El Paso. With the help of Bixler-Zavala, he was able to return to El Paso where he could begin to reclaim his life from addiction and join At the Drive-In as backup vocalist and bass guitarist. After receiving a record deal with Flipside Records and recording Acrobatic Tenement with the band, he became their full-time bassist before switching to guitar. After several years and two more critically acclaimed albums, for a variety of reasons, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala left At the Drive-In and the band went on ""indefinite hiatus"". The remaining members, Paul Hinojos, Tony Hajjar, and Jim Ward went on to form Sparta while the duo focused on other projects.
On January 9, 2012, At the Drive-In announced that they were reforming for a tour. The band released their fourth album In•ter a•li•a in 2017 before going on an indefinite hiatus in November 2018.

The Mars Volta (2001–2012, 2019–present)
They refocused their efforts on the dub outfit called De Facto, which also included Jeremy Ward and Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens, and which they had started years before while still in At the Drive-In. Eventually the same collective of musicians in De Facto would be expanded into Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala's new band, The Mars Volta. Once again starting from scratch he wrote and toured with the band which consumed almost all his time and money.
On May 25, 2003, less than a month before the release of their first full-length album, De-Loused in the Comatorium, bandmate and close friend Jeremy Ward was found dead of a heroin overdose. This event, coupled with the memories of the suicide of his friend Julio Venegas years earlier, finally convinced both him and Bixler-Zavala to quit using opiates. Since then he has been clean and credited his newfound musical work ethic on his new lifestyle. The Mars Volta's second album, Frances the Mute, would later be dedicated to Ward.
During the early years of the band he also worked on a low budget movie called A Manual Dexterity which starred Jeremy Ward. The soundtrack A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume 1 was released in 2004. The release of the second volume, which was originally planned for Spring of 2005, and the film were both delayed indefinitely due to legal problems. Conflicts over ownership of certain footage and Rodríguez-López's reluctance to revisit the project which featured his late friend Jeremy Ward were both cited as reasons for the delay. However, Rodríguez-López stated that he does intend to release both Volume 2 and the film at some point in the future.
On February 8, 2009, he and his fellow Mars Volta bandmates won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
On January 23, 2013, The Mars Volta officially announced that they had broken up, following a series of tweets posted by Cedric Bixler-Zavala stating that he had departed the band. Their future was uncertain at this point, although Rodriguez-Lopez has not ruled out the possibility of reuniting in the future.
On June 18, 2022, The Mars Volta revealed the coordinates to a location in Los Angeles, California, where fans were allowed to preview new music from the band. This was followed up by the release of the single ""Blacklight Shine"" and a tour announcement, marking both their first new music and first live shows in ten years. The band subsequently announced their first album in 10 years, The Mars Volta, which was released on September 16, 2022.

Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group (2005–2012, 2018)
In 2005 Rodríguez-López relocated to Amsterdam, where he eventually wrote and recorded four separate albums. His first solo project was the ""Omar Rodríguez-López Quintet"". Rodríguez-López played several live shows in Europe with his quintet, which in 2005 also included three members of The Mars Volta Group (Juan Alderete, Marcel Rodríguez-López and Adrián Terrazas-González) and Money Mark.
The songs featured on this tour later appeared on the album Omar Rodriguez. It was characterized by long, improvisational songs with Dutch titles and no lyrics. The Quintet also performed live with Damo Suzuki, parts of which were recorded and incorporated into a 25-minute EP titled Please Heat This Eventually, which was released in 2007.
During this time Rodríguez-López was also working on The Mars Volta's 2006 record Amputechture and composing the score to the film El Búfalo de la Noche simultaneously to his work with the quintet.
On May 29, 2007, Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo was released. It was the third full-length solo album by Rodríguez-López. It featured performances by Mars Volta members Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marcel Rodríguez-López, Juan Alderete, Adrián Terrazas-González as well as cameos by Money Mark, John Frusciante, and Jon Theodore. It was written and recorded between 2005 and 2006 in California and Amsterdam.
The Quintet later resurfaced in 2007, now known as ""The Rodríguez-López Group"" to perform on the ""white"" stage at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan on July 28. Performing with the group for the first time were singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and drummer Thomas Pridgen.

Solo releases (2004–present)
On October 8, 2007, the EP Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Lydia Lunch, a collaboration with spoken word poet Lydia Lunch, was released. The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange is a double LP featuring the original quintet and was released on vinyl November 20, 2007. It was also released for digital download. Calibration, a record that Rodríguez-López recorded during his stay in Amsterdam, was released February 5, 2008. It was described as being influenced by electronic music and acid-jazz.
On June 10, 2008, a recording titled Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Jeremy Michael Ward was released. It was a collaboration between the two and was recorded in 2001 before the formation of The Mars Volta. The LP consists of various ambient tracks based on field recordings in the musique concrète tradition. Rodríguez-López has continued to release a series of albums recorded in 2001 which include Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fungus and Minor Cuts and Scrapes in the Bushes Ahead, both released in late 2008.
Another album, Old Money was released in October 2008, with a vinyl version becoming available in early 2009 on the Stones Throw record label. Sonny Kay, co-owner of the former Gold Standard Labs label with Omar, created the album covers (and has done so for the majority of future Omar releases). Two Omar Rodríguez-López solo albums were released in Europe on January 26, 2009, from the Netherlands-based record label Willie Anderson Recordings: Megaritual and Despair. Despair is best described as a field recording, while Megaritual is a collaboration jam between Omar and his brother, Marcel Rodríguez-López.
In mid-2009, a new entity has been created called El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez (the New Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group) to release the first in a series of three recordings completed in 2006. Thus far these recordings have only been known as the Omar and Zach Hill collaborations. The first recording titled Cryptomnesia was released on May 5, 2009. Vocals written and performed by Bixler-Zavala were recorded in 2008. The lineup for this entity is: Omar Rodríguez-López on guitar, Cedric Bixler-Zavala on vocals, Zach Hill on drums, Jonathan Hischke on synth bass, and Juan Alderete on bass.
The Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group toured Europe in March 2009, supported by Zechs Marquise.
At the end of 2009, Rodríguez-López released three albums, Los Sueños de un Hígado, Xenophanes and Solar Gambling digitally through Rodríguez-López Productions. While Xenophanes was also released on CD and vinyl, Los Suenos De Un Higado and Solar Gambling only had a limited vinyl release. Rodríguez-López also created a video for ""Asco Que Conmueve los Puntos Erógenos"", from Xenophanes, and posted it on YouTube on November 30, 2009.
In January 2010, Ciencia de los Inútiles was released under a new group, El Trio de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. The trio features Rodríguez-López on acoustic guitar, Ximena Sariñana on vocals and Aaron Cruz on upright bass. A video for ""Miércoles"" was also released. In May 2010, he released a collaboration titled Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante with John Frusciante, free of charge through his website, with the option to donate. All money raised will go to the Keep Music in Schools programs. On May 30, 2010, the album Sepulcros de Miel by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quartet was digitally released, which also featured Frusciante.
The album Tychozorente was scheduled for release on November 1, 2010; however, it received an early release on September 14, 2010, as a digital download. Another album, titled Cizaña de los Amores, was digitally released on October 11, 2010. CD and vinyl versions of both albums are only available in Europe. Mantra Hiroshima, another Omar and Zach Hill collaboration, was digitally released on November 29, followed next day by Dōitashimashite, album of live material recorded in September during the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group's first US tour. A video for ""Agua Dulce de Pulpo"" from the album Un Escorpión Perfumado was also released during that period, and the album itself was released on December 20 in digital form, with CD and vinyl versions to follow.
On April 16, 2011, Omar released Telesterion, a compilation album featuring 38 songs from Omar's solo albums. Although this has been the only release of 2011, other projects have been hinted at, such as Двойственность вздохов (Russian for Duality of Sighs), a documentary about the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group's Russian mini-tour, directed by Omar and shot by Paco Ibarra. The Vinyl edition of Telesterion also contained artwork for 6 solo albums that have yet to be released, and featured a new track, ""Cásate Colmillo"", off of an album supposedly titled The Somnambulis.
On July 7, 2016, Ipecac Records announced that they would release 12 albums by Omar, fortnightly, until December 2016. They were recorded in the period 2008–2013 and one featured The Mars Volta line-up and a guest appearance by John Frusciante. The first album Sworn Virgins was released digitally on July 15, 2016, and featured the single ""To Kill a Chi Chi"". Recorded in El Paso and Zapopan, the other titles include Corazones, Blind Worms Pious Swine, Arañas En La Sombra, Umbrella Mistress, El Bien Y Mal Nos Une, Cell Phone Bikini, Infinity Drips, Weekly Mansions, Zapopan, Nom De Guerre Cabal, and Some Need It Lonely.

Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque (2012–2018)
In 2012, with Mars Volta going on hiatus, Rodríguez-López formed a solo band that eventually took the name Bosnian Rainbows. It consists of Deantoni Parks (drums, keyboards), Teri Gender Bender (vocals) and Nicci Kasper (keyboards). They released one self-titled album in June 2013. On April 8, 2014, Omar announced a new musical project called Antemasque with former At the Drive-In and Mars Volta bandmates Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals) and David Elitch (drums) as well as Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The group released their first song, ""4AM"". Flea said that Antemasque is a project between Omar and Cedric, and that he is only a contributing artist.
As of 2018, both Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque have essentially been put on hold due to touring commitments of At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta.

Other media
Aside from music, Rodríguez-López is also involved in filmmaking and photography. Beginning in his At the Drive-in days he started to document many kinds of things: live shows, sound checks, dressing rooms, hotels, airport lounges, sightseeing, encounters with colleagues. Since 2001 he has produced many films, of which  The Sentimental Engine Slayer was the first to be released. Rodríguez-López wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, which was premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in February 2010 and saw the DVD release in January 2013. Another film directed by Omar, Los Chidos, was premiered in March 2012 at SXSW. Furthermore, Rodríguez-López and Hans Zimmer worked together to compose the score for the 2009 Guillermo Arriaga film The Burning Plain. The film was his second collaboration with the writer/director after scoring the 2007 film El Búfalo de la Noche with The Mars Volta; in addition to some original material, the score also includes material used in Amputechture. Rodríguez-López's first photo book, Hunters in High Heels documenting the years from 2000 to 2006, was slated to release in 2013 but was since postponed indefinitely due to unknown reasons.

Musicianship
Style
Rodríguez-López's compositional and playing style is characterized by, among other factors, riffs, melodies based in minor modes, changing meters, unresolving dissonances (in particular a heavy use of the tritone), chromatic passages, and lengthy improvisation. He is also known for his vast array of effects pedals; in a feature appearing in Guitar World, Rodríguez-López stated that he ""began to see effects as allies in my war against the guitar"". In that interview he also stated that he hated the guitar for a very long time. He only utilized it because it was the instrument his bandmates could ""relate to"". He said he ""wrestled"" guitar by adding effects and playing oddly to attempt ""making it sound like anything besides this thing I hate—the guitar!"". However, he claimed to feel more comfortable with the instrument on Amputechture.
Rodríguez-López plays guitar left-handed. He has cited salsa pianist and bandleader Larry Harlow as his primary influence. Both Rodríguez-López and bandmate Cedric Bixler-Zavala have recorded with former Can lead singer Damo Suzuki for the Please Heat This Eventually EP. In the progressive rock genre in which The Mars Volta are often categorized, he has professed that he ""like[s] a lot of those groups, particularly King Crimson and early Genesis."" As such, he has cited his main and clearest influence Frank Zappa, Crimson's Robert Fripp, jazz fusion guitarist John McLaughlin as well as hardcore punk and hard rock guitarists Greg Ginn and Jimi Hendrix respectively. He has also named Siouxsie, Missing Persons, Wayne Shorter as being among ""all the greats"" along with Steve Reich, Tangerine Dream, Tchaikovsky, Tom Petty and Marvin Gaye."" He has also stated that film is a primary influence on him, likening his recording style to that of a film director, where the ""scenes are shot out of sequence and the final creation is in the hands of the director."".

Equipment
Omar has endorsed Ibanez guitars since The Mars Volta's inception in 2001. Previously he used Squier Super-Sonic guitars while playing with At the Drive-In. He also recorded De-Loused in the Comatorium with a Gibson SG II from the early 1970s which he also used in live improv shows with Flea and John Frusciante. He uses Seymour Duncan JB Jr. pickups as well. Although he tunes to E standard tuning, Omar uses Ernie Ball .013-.056 gauge strings with a wound G string, saying that ""they feel more real than the really thin ones"". Omar also plays through an Orange Rockerverb combo amp as well. In recent years, Omar has taken a minimalist approach to his pedals, which at one point was a very complex setup. During The Mars Volta's 2011 tour with Soundgarden, he used a Boss DD5 Digital Delay, an MXR Phase 90, an Electro-Harmonix Memory Boy analog delay, a Boss PS-6 Harmonist, a Line 6 M9 Stompbox Modeler, an MXR M133 Micro Amp, an Ibanez WH10V2 wah-wah, an Ibanez TC7 tri-mode chorus, and a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler.
During The Mars Volta's final shows and At the Drive-In's reunion tour, Rodriguez-Lopez switched back to a full-sized Ibanez Jetking guitar, although retaining his preferred single-pickup and volume knob configuration and 24"" neck scale. In a recent interview with TC Electronic, he is seen using a blue Ibanez Jetking with two full-size humbuckers.
Most recently, while performing with Bosnian Rainbows, Rodriguez-Lopez began to use a mid-1960s era left-handed Supro 3/4 scale guitar with a single pickup in the bridge position. Shortly afterwards, he was seen playing a custom Ibanez guitar that closely resembled his Supro. In addition, Rodriguez-Lopez now uses flatwound strings on his guitar. Rodriguez-Lopez's pedalboard for Bosnian Rainbows consisted of a Boss TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, an Empress Superdelay, a Blackout Effects Whetstone analog phaser, a Catalinbread Semaphore tremolo pedal, a Boss DD-5 Digital Delay, an EarthQuaker Devices Rainbow Machine, an Empress Fuzz pedal, a Catalinbread Calisto chorus/vibrato pedal, and a Boss SL-20 slicer.

Signature guitars
In 2008, Ibanez released the ORM-1 Omar Rodriguez-Lopez signature guitar, which was produced through 2012.
Rodríguez-López designed and released the Mariposa signature guitar with Ernie Ball Music Man in 2019. It has an okoume body in an angular shape with a laser-etched floral pickguard, and two custom humbuckers featuring two volume knobs with a tethered tone circuit, which creates variations in treble response when the pickups are set at different levels.

As producer
Rodríguez-López is also notable for his recording, producing and songwriting techniques. He has claimed that he is ""ignorant of music theory"" and that thus he lacks knowledge in writing music in standard notation, claiming that his songwriting ""comes from emotion completely"". Rodríguez-López claims to write all of the music for his projects, then dictates the performance to the musicians involved.
In addition to his producing credits with The Mars Volta and his solo albums, he also produced the only LP from the defunct LA-based band Radio Vago and in 2009, handled the production of a recording titled ""Terra Incognita"" from actress/singer Juliette Lewis' band The New Romantiques. Omar also produced (as well as contributed bass to) Sin Sin Sin, the debut LP from the band Le Butcherettes, which was released in 2011 on Rodriguez-Lopez Productions.

Omar Rodriguez interview"
Rob Haigh,"Robert Haigh, also known as Omni Trio, is a British electronic, ambient and experimental musician.

Career
Early work (1979–1991)
At school, Haigh was in a band called Labyrinth playing original material that was influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music. In the early 1980s Haigh released a series of experimental ambient albums under the names Robert Haigh and Sema – the most notable being ‘Three Seasons Only’ and ‘Notes From Underground’. He also contributed to several Nurse With Wound projects and formed an industrial avant-funk band called The Truth Club together with Trefor Goronwy, who would go on to join This Heat. In a 1994 feature in The Wire on ambient jungle by Simon Reynolds, Haigh's influences were listed as Pere Ubu, The Pop Group, Can, Faust and Neu! as well as Miles Davis and King Tubby.

Omni Trio (1992–2004)
In the 1990s, Haigh developed a unique style of what has become known as ‘ambient drum 'n' bass’ and released six EPs and six albums under the name Omni Trio to great acclaim. The Omni Trio sound is notable for its intricate breakbeat patterns, orchestrated production, atmospheric sound palette, sweetly melodic piano vamps, and creative use of sampled soul-diva vocals. Omni Trio was one of the original drum 'n' bass producers, who first released for Moving Shadow as early as 1993. He produced several anthems in the period now known as ""old skool"", including ""Mystic Stepper (Feel Better)"", ""Renegade Snares"", ""Thru the Vibe"", and ""Living for the Future"". All of these featured on his acclaimed first LP, The Deepest Cut Vol 1 (1995), which was released under the title Music For The Next Millennium that same year in the US through Sm:)e Communications.
He followed this up with The Haunted Science in 1996, which included the singles ""Trippin' on Broken Beats"" and ""Nu Birth of Cool"". Mainstream trends in dancefloor-oriented drum 'n' bass rapidly diverged from his musical style, and subsequent albums Skeleton Keys (1997), the Detroit techno-influenced Byte Size Life (1999), and Even Angels Cast Shadows (2001) produced no big club hits on the scale of his early singles, but they further cemented his reputation as one of the finest album-oriented musicians in the genre. Indeed, he was the first drum'n'bass artist to produce six full-length artist albums.
Many Omni Trio tracks feature on popular video games: ""Renegade Snares"" appears in the game Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, ""First Contact"" (from Even Angels Cast Shadows) is featured in Grand Theft Auto 3 and ""Secret Life"" is featured in the futuristic racing video game Rollcage Stage II.
Following the release of the sixth and final Omni Trio album Rogue Satellite in 2004, Haigh decided to cease recording as Omni Trio.

Current work (2005–present)
Since Omni Trio, Haigh has released a series of modern classical and minimalist albums under his own name: the post Minimalist From the Air (2006) and Written on Water (2008), and the piano works: Notes and Crossings (2009), Anonymous Lights (2010), Strange and Secret Things (2011), and Darkling Streams (2013). On his decision to cease recording as Omni Trio he has said: ""After Even Angels Cast Shadows and especially the minimal structures of Rogue Satellite, I felt that perhaps my work was done in this particular area. All along the intention was to do the Omni Trio stuff alongside producing and releasing piano based material under my own name. Then the Omni thing blew up much bigger than I had anticipated. But throughout the '90s I also kept writing piano and minimal themes. By the early 2000s the time seemed right to put the emphasis on developing this material.""
In 2014, German label VOD released the compilation album Cold Pieces. This is a companion collection to 2012's Time Will Say Nothing box set. These two compilations represent Haigh's earliest solo output – covering most of the eighties (1982 to 1989.) Where Time Will Say Nothing focused on Haigh's darker and more industrial period, Cold Pieces represents the evolution into more piano based experimentation.
In January 2015, Haigh released an 18 track collection of piano compositions called The Silence Of Ghosts. Much of the material on The Silence of Ghosts is developed from piano improvisation. In a recent interview he states: ""Most of my compositions start from freeform improvisation at the piano. Later I revisit the more compelling themes and from there, structures start to emerge. I never use formal notation just the odd rough diagrams and written reminders.""

Orbital (band),"Orbital are an English electronic music duo from Otford, Kent, England, consisting of brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll. The band's name is taken from Greater London's orbital motorway, the M25, which was central to the early rave scene during the early days of acid house. Additionally, the cover art on three of their albums showcase stylised atomic orbitals. Orbital have been critically and commercially successful, known particularly for their live improvisation during shows. They were initially influenced by early electro and punk rock.

Career
Early years
In 1989, Orbital recorded ""Chime"" on their father's 4 track tape deck, which they released on DJ Jazzy M's Oh Zone Records in December 1989 and re-released on FFRR Records a few months later. The track became a rave anthem, reaching number 17 in the UK charts and earning them an appearance on Top of the Pops, during which they wore anti-Poll Tax T-shirts. According to Paul Hartnoll, the track was recorded ""under the stairs"" of their parents' house in ""a knocked-through stair cupboard that my dad set up as a home office"". The track received its first live airing at a club night hosted by the promoter Que Pasa (Mark, Andrew and Nick Maddox) in a local Sevenoaks venue called the Grasshopper on Boxing Day. Next was a gig at the Town and Country 2 in Islington, performing for the first time under the name Orbital. Several singles and EPs followed, and their first self-titled album, a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991.
In late 1992, the Radiccio EP barely reached the UK top 40, although it included one of their most popular songs, ""Halcyon"". The track featured a sample of Kirsty Hawkshaw from ""It's a Fine Day"" (a chart hit for Opus III earlier that year). The B-side ""The Naked and the Dead"" was similarly based on a line from Scott Walker's rendition of Jacques Brel's song ""Next"". ""Halcyon"" was dedicated to the Hartnolls' mother, who was addicted to the tranquiliser Halcion (Triazolam) for many years.
The duo's popularity grew rapidly with the release of their second self-titled album, in 1993. The album included complex arrangements and textures, opening with the two-minute track ""Time Becomes"". The track consisted of two slightly delayed, looped samples of a line from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Time Squared spoken by actor Michael Dorn as the character Lieutenant Worf: ""... where time becomes a loop"" being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until one cycle of phase difference has happened). The same sample was used at the beginning of ""the Moebius"", the opening track in the previous album. This audio pun was intended to make listeners believe that they had bought a mis-pressed album (Orbital 1 packaged as Orbital 2). The album reached #28 on the UK album charts, staying in the chart for 15 weeks. ""Halcyon"" was remixed for the album, as ""Halcyon + On + On"". Versions of this song played live by the band have incorporated diverse samples, including ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" by the band Bon Jovi, ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"" by Belinda Carlisle, and in 2004 ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"" by the band The Darkness.
The first two albums are commonly known as ""The Green Album"" and ""The Brown Album"", after the colours of their covers (although the first album's cover is yellow, one of the first printings had a misprint causing the cover to be yellow-green).

1994 breakthrough
Orbital won an NME award for Vibes Best Dance Act early in 1994, but it was their headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 25 June 1994 that brought them most attention. Q magazine classed it as one of the top 50 gigs of all time, and in 2002 included Orbital in their list of ""50 Bands to See Before You Die"".
Crucially, the expanded TV coverage of the 1994 Glastonbury Festival by Channel 4 meant that Orbital's set reached a huge audience, in what is regarded as a pivotal moment. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the gig, Paul Hartnoll commented: ""I didn't know how much of an impact it would have. Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time – of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to think it should be happening.""
Orbital gave an improvisational element to live electronic music as the brothers mixed and sequenced their tracks on the fly, wearing their trademark head-mounted torches behind banks of equipment. Orbital were one of the few electronic acts invited to play at Woodstock '94.
The third album, Snivilisation, was released in August 1994. Alison Goldfrapp provided vocals on a couple of the tracks, including the single ""Are We Here?"". This track also included a sample from ""Man at C&A"" by The Specials. Among the remixes of ""Are We Here?"" was ""Criminal Justice Bill?"" – four minutes of silence, a reference to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which was in part intended to clamp down on the rave scene which had given birth to Orbital. The other track with Goldfrapp vocals, ""Sad But True"", was remixed for the Times Fly EP, the band's only release in 1995.
The single ""The Box"" was released in April 1996, reaching number 11 in the UK, and its parent album In Sides, released in May 1996, became their second Top Five album. In Sides has since come to be one of their most critically well-regarded works. As with the previous album, there was a vague theme of ecological disaster and dissatisfaction with society.
The following year, the duo contributed to film soundtracks (The Saint, Event Horizon, Spawn) and enjoyed the biggest singles of their career, with a live version of ""Satan"" and their reworking of the aforementioned The Saint theme both reaching number three in the UK. The In Sides track ""Out There Somewhere (Part 2)"" was also included in the long-awaited game series relaunch of Test Drive 4.
Orbital would go on to aid the Mortal Kombat film soundtrack in reaching Platinum selling status during 1995, with a remix of ""Halcyon"", which can be heard during the final scene of the film.

Later albums
In 1998, they returned to the studio to work on their fifth album The Middle of Nowhere. This was released in 1999, becoming their third top five album, and was a return to a more upbeat style; with Alison Goldfrapp returning on vocals and the single ""Style"" using the stylophone. In 2000 the single ""Beached"" was released from the soundtrack to the film The Beach, mixing the brothers' musical style with a melody by Angelo Badalamenti and the words of Leonardo DiCaprio from the film.
The Altogether, released in 2001, included guest vocals by the Hartnolls' brother-in-law David Gray, a sampled Ian Dury, and a version of the Doctor Who theme, and was mixed for 5.1 surround sound. It was to be their last album for FFRR, and had a mixed critical reception. The following year, Work 1989-2002 collected various singles from ""Chime"" onwards. Orbital recorded the track ""Technologique Park"" for the 2002 film XXX, in which they can be seen playing the track live in a club.
In 2003, Orbital recorded the soundtrack for the horror film Octane.
Orbital split up in 2004. They played a final series of gigs in June and July 2004 at the Glastonbury Festival, the T in the Park Festival in Scotland, the Oxegen festival in Ireland, Istanbul, Turkey and the Wire Festival in Japan, concluding with a live Peel Session gig at Maida Vale Studios in London on 28 July 2004. The release of their seventh and last original album, Blue Album, coincided with this final wave of shows. The album included Sparks (on ""Acid Pants"") and Lisa Gerrard (on the final single, ""One Perfect Sunrise"").

Following the breakup
Paul Hartnoll continued to record music under his own name, including tracks for the 2005 game Wipeout Pure for the PSP. He released his first solo album, The Ideal Condition, on the ACP record label in June 2007. Alongside Flood, he also jointly produced Strength in Numbers by band The Music.
Phil Hartnoll formed a new electronica duo, Long Range, with Nick Smith. Their debut album, Madness and Me, was released on their own label, Long Range Recordings, in August 2007. 
Orbital released a two-CD/DVD compilation Orbital: Live at Glastonbury 1994-2004 in June 2007, containing over two hours of music recorded at their various performances at the festival.

Comeback and Wonky
On 21 November 2008, Orbital announced they would be reforming to play a gig together called ""20 years after Chime"" at The Big Chill Festival 2009. They preceded this show with a headline performance at RockNess 2009 in June.

On 26 January 2009, their official website Loopz announced confirmed dates for their 20th anniversary tour. ""The Orbital reformation gathers momentum with headline shows now confirmed for Manchester and London this September."" The concerts met with positive reviews. The band's first performance after the breakup took place in June 2009 at Selector Festival in Cracow, Poland. On 17 April 2009, it was announced that Orbital would be playing at The Electric Picnic in September 2009.
On 16 June 2009, Orbital released a 2-CD collection of their favourite tracks. The collection, Orbital 20 (stylised as ""20rbital""), covered the 20 years since ""Chime"" and contained 20 tracks. A single, ""Don't Stop Me"" / ""The Gun is Good"" was issued in 2010 on 12"" and digital download. At the Glastonbury Festival on 27 June 2010 to close their set, Matt Smith, who played the Eleventh Doctor, came on stage and performed with Orbital their cover of the Doctor Who theme tune.
On 16 February 2011, Orbital posted a video diary on YouTube, via Loopz. The video diary reported their progress on the recording of their new album, along with remixes of existing material for their DJ sets. Subsequent diary updates have been published. In October 2011, Orbital announced a six gig UK tour (including a date at the Royal Albert Hall) and new album in April 2012. ""Never"", a track from the forthcoming album, was offered as a free download. The album titled Wonky was released on 2 April 2012, and included collaborations with singer Zola Jesus and MC Lady Leshurr. The albums release was featured on US radio on PrototypeRadio, which also marked the bands debut radio appearance on American radio.
Orbital appeared at the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Paralympic Games, performing ""Where Is It Going?"" live with Stephen Hawking delivering a speech about the Large Hadron Collider.
On 8 October 2012, Orbital released their soundtrack to the 2012 re-make of Pusher, including vocals from Toni Halliday.

Second breakup
On 21 October 2014, Orbital announced on their official website that they were ""hanging up their iconic torch-glasses and parting ways for the final time"" but would continue to work on projects separately. Phil Hartnoll focused on a DJ career, including a performance at Fuji Rock Festival, while Paul Hartnoll worked on a variety of music projects, including a solo album under the name 8:58 in 2015, a collaboration with Vince Clarke of Erasure called 2Square, and soundtrack work for Peaky Blinders and American Ultra.

2017 reunion and Monsters Exist
In February 2017, Orbital reunited and announced tour dates in June and July, at Forbidden Fruit in Dublin, Bluedot Festival at Jodrell Bank and Standon Calling in Hertfordshire, and announced that they were working on a new album, releasing ""Kinetic 2017"", an updated remix of an early single, alongside the announcement. At the Bluedot Festival in July, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop joined Orbital on stage to perform ""Doctor?"" live, and in August 2017 the band released non-album single ""Copenhagen"" after working on the song during their summer live sets.
In December 2017, Orbital played two sell out shows over two nights at the Manchester O2 Apollo and the London Eventim Apollo. The sets included two previously unheard songs, ""Phuk"" (stylised ""P.H.U.K."") and ""Tiny Foldable Cities"". These two shows were released on CD through Pledge Music. A third previously unheard song, ""The End is Nigh"", was debuted May 2018 at the Biggest Weekend festival in Belfast.
A new album, entitled Monsters Exist, was released on 14 September 2018. It was the first Orbital album since In Sides to feature artwork by John Greenwood, and featured physicist Brian Cox on its final track.
In 2019, Orbital revealed plans for a 30th anniversary album, which would feature a compilation of updated versions of their songs created by themselves and their contemporaries. In early 2020, Orbital began performing two new songs tentatively titled ""One Day"" and ""Treadmill"" at live shows, including a live streamed ""Stay-At-Home-Rave"" hosted by United We Stream and The Haçienda, benefiting those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Greater Manchester.
In 2022, the duo composed and recorded the soundtrack for the Netflix comedy series The Pentaverate created by Mike Myers. On 20 October, they announced their tenth studio album titled Optical Delusion, which was released on 17 February 2023, along with a lead single titled ""Dirty Rat"", featuring Sleaford Mods.

Political commentary
Throughout their career, Orbital have sometimes incorporated political and environmental commentary into their music. Early single Choice samples a speech against militarization from Crucifix's ""Annihilation"". The track ""Forever"" on Snivilisation samples a speech by Graham Crowden from the 1982 Lindsay Anderson film Britannia Hospital, in which he lambasts humankind; and ""You Lot"" on the Blue Album included a confrontational, partially vocoded sample of Christopher Eccleston playing the second coming of Jesus Christ in the TV two-part series The Second Coming written by Russell T Davies.
Although only the phrase ""New Age Travellers"" from John Major's 1992 Conservative Party conference speech is retained in the 1995 single release of Sad But New, Orbital first unveiled the track including a fuller version of the speech in March 1995 as part of a live broadcast on BBC Radio 1 ""Interactive Radio Night"", and as a response to the newly passed Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. 
The track ""The Girl with the Sun in Her Head"" from In Sides was recorded in a studio powered only by Greenpeace's mobile solar power generator, CYRUS. On the same album, ""Dŵr Budr"", Welsh for ""dirty water"", was inspired by the Sea Empress oil spill which took place just off the southern coast of Wales in February 1996. The album as whole is a concept album on that theme, for example the track ""P.E.T.R.O.L"".
The video for 2018 single ""P.H.U.K"" (off Monsters Exist) features photography taken from British news services, with loose references to Brexit, the London fatberg, the Grenfell Tower fire, moped crime, and the 2010s migrant crisis, among other current events, and the title ""Please Help United Kingdom"" reappearing. Although not strictly political, the track ""There Will Come a Time"" (also featured on Monsters Exist) includes a spoken passage by the physicist Brian Cox, where he addresses the future of an expanding universe and the inevitable demise of the Earth, and urges mankind to care for the planet and maintain a peaceful existence while the Earth is still our home.
Starting in 2019, live performances of the track ""Impact (The Earth Is Burning)"" have included a sampled speech from Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, declaring ""Our house is on fire. I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic.""
Paul Hartnoll described his intentions behind Orbital's sociopolitical messages as ""quite ambiguous. Rather than making social comments, I suppose what we're doing is trying to put a score to the times we live in. I'd like to think that some of these are universal issues – the earth is still burning, even today, the world isn't fixed, and governments are still fucking idiots. I'm not saying I could do any better, but they could. With our music, we're saying 'go on then, sort it out!'""

Ottmar Liebert,"Ottmar Liebert (born 1 February 1959) is a German guitarist, songwriter and producer best known for his Spanish-influenced music. A five-time Grammy Award nominee, Liebert has received 38 Gold and Platinum certifications in the United States, as well as certifications in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. His debut album Nouveau Flamenco (1990) was certified Platinum in the United States.

Early life
Ottmar Liebert was born 1 February 1959 in Cologne, West Germany, to a Chinese-German father and a Hungarian mother. As a child, he spent most of his time travelling throughout Europe and Asia with his family. He began playing classical guitar at 11, and studying flamenco guitar at 14, after he ""found a Flamenco LP in the bargain bin at a local supermarket."" After performing rock music in his native Germany, he moved to the United States and settled in Boston for a few years, performing in various rock clubs. In 1986 Liebert settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he began looking to create a new musical sound.
Liebert cites musical influences such as ""Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucía, John McLaughlin, Robert Fripp and Jeff Beck, others were horn players like Miles Davis,""  although he cites ""others yet were fine artists who taught me about space and brush strokes and dynamics and contrast.""

Music career
In 1988, Liebert founded the first incarnation of his band Luna Negra (black moon). That year he recorded a self-produced album titled Marita: Shadows and Storms. The initial thousand copies were sold in the gallery of Santa Fe artist Frank Howell. When the record found its way to radio stations and began generating a response among listeners, Higher Octave Music picked it up and released a remastered version titled Nouveau Flamenco (1990). The album eventually sold double-platinum in the United States.
Liebert followed up his debut with several successful albums that continued and expanded his sound, including Borrasca (1991), Solo Para Ti (1992) and The Hours Between Night + Day (1993), all three earning Gold certification. Liebert's international success continued with ¡Viva! (1995) and Opium (1996), both of which earned Platinum status in the United States and Latin America.
Liebert has recorded with Luna Negra since 1989. Personnel in the band have changed regularly since then, with the only constant being bassist Jon Gagan.
Since 1990, Ottmar Liebert has released a total of 25 albums including live releases, Christmas CDs, 15 CDs of original music, a DVD, and various remixes. He has received 38 Gold and Platinum certifications in the US as well as certifications in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
In 2006, Liebert contributed his song ""This Spring Release 10,000 Butterflies"" to the album project Artists for Charity - Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.

Nouveau Flamenco
Liebert describes his musical style as ""Nouveau Flamenco."" In a 2004 interview, Liebert explained that once he was signed to a record label, he was required to come up with a name for what he was doing. Although there are flamenco elements to his music, it's nothing like traditional flamenco, being based on melody and using much simpler forms. As this music couldn't be considered jazz, rock, or classical, he felt that flamenco was the closest word to use that people could identify with.
Liebert drew some criticism with his adoption of the term, especially since according to critics, none of his works to date followed traditional flamenco palo forms. It was also perceived by some as a marketing ploy and an attempt to associate his music with the then burgeoning school of ""Flamenco Nuevo"", where acknowledged flamenco artists had started to rejuvenate and reinvent flamenco through the introduction of influences from Latin America (e.g. the Rumba rhythm) and even jazz music. Paco de Lucia was one such critic. Despite Liebert's citing Paco as an influence, Paco described Liebert's music as ""una degeneración, una caricatura del flamenco"" (literally, ""a degeneration, a caricature""). However, Paco later seemed to appreciate Liebert's music, with Paco's record company even mentioning him in promotional materials.

Personal life
Since 1986 Liebert has lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In May 2006 Liebert was ordained as a Zen monk by Dennis Genpo Merzel at the Kanzeon Zen Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Panda Bear (musician),"Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978), also known by his moniker Panda Bear, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and co-founding member of the band Animal Collective. In addition to his work with that group, Lennox has released six solo LPs since 1999, with his 2007 album Person Pitch inspiring the chillwave genre and numerous other acts. His subsequent albums Tomboy (2011) and Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper (2015) both reached the Billboard 200.
Lennox was primarily raised in Baltimore, Maryland, where he sang tenor in his high school chamber choir, and studied piano and cello. The name ""Panda Bear"" derived from his habit of drawing pandas on his early mixtapes as a teenager. He and the other members of Animal Collective began collaborating in the late 1990s. He has also collaborated with other artists, including Daft Punk on their 2013 single ""Doin' It Right"" and Sonic Boom on the 2022 album Reset. Since 2004, he has lived in Lisbon, Portugal.

Early life
Lennox grew up in the Roland Park section of Baltimore, Maryland, and attended Waldorf School of Baltimore through 8th grade, and Kimberton Waldorf School in Chester County, Pennsylvania, for high school. His family moved frequently during his early years, owing to his father's studies to be an orthopedic surgeon. As a youth, he played sports, mainly soccer and basketball. His brother, Matt Lennox (whom the Animal Collective song ""Brother Sport"" is directed at), was a leading player on the high school basketball team and Noah was also a team member, playing as point guard.
Lennox has also stated in interviews that he enjoyed drawing a lot as a teenager, especially pandas. He also studied piano until he was eight, then cello, and later on he sang tenor in his high school chamber choir.
Though he and his family have never been very religious, Lennox briefly attended Boston University, where he majored in religion because of his interest in ""the concept of God"".

Career
Animal Collective
As a teen, Lennox began listening to electronic music styles such as house and techno, and artists such as Aphex Twin, all of which became a major influence on his later work. He recorded and performed music solo and with friends. 
Lennox had been friends with Deakin (Josh Dibb) since the second grade. Deakin introduced Lennox to his high school friends Avey Tare (Dave Portner) and Geologist (Brian Weitz). For years, the four of them swapped homemade recordings, shared musical ideas and performed in different group configurations. Lennox, along with Deakin moved to New York in 2000. The band then became more collaborative in nature and they finally settled on the name ""Animal Collective"". 

Since the 2007 releases of Panda Bear's Person Pitch and Animal Collective's Strawberry Jam, he has focused more on using samplers and other electronics in their shows. He has named Black Dice as a major influence stating ""Black Dice took us on our first tour and I feel like the wisest things I've learned about being in a band I learned by watching them."" He said he looks to Black Dice ""as a model for a band... I feel like as a band, I can't speak for the other guys [of Animal Collective], but certainly for myself, like I modelled the way I approach to everything with the band watching the way Black Dice did it."" In addition to singing, Lennox played drums and occasionally guitar in Animal Collective's live performances. He cites Stewart Copeland as the biggest influence on his drumming style; for his drumming work on Animal Collective's 2022 album Time Skiffs, Lennox cited James Brown's drummers, especially Clyde Stubblefield, as influences.

Solo work
Lennox's early musical influences included electronic styles, and his solo work has been variously characterized as experimental pop, electronic, bedroom pop, neo-psychedelic pop, and indie music. The Line of Best Fit called him a ""psychedelic pop trailblazer."" Lennox's debut album Panda Bear was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up Young Prayer in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album Person Pitch in 2007.  Of his songwriting style, Lennox says ""I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something.""
Panda Bear's fourth album, Tomboy, was released April 12, 2011, on his own label, Paw Tracks. He started performing material from Tomboy on December 5, 2008, at a show with No Age in Miami, Florida. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. He also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single ""Tomboy"" and the b-side ""Slow Motion"" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles ""You Can Count on Me"" and ""Alsatian Darn"" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of ""You Can Count On Me"" sold out in less than a day. The single ""Last Night at the Jetty"" was released December 2010. The single ""Surfer's Hymn"" was released March 28, 2011.

His song ""Comfy In Nautica"" appears in ABC's 2010 climate change TV special Earth 2100.
Lennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.
In June 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. In October 2014, the Mr Noah EP was released, featuring four new songs. The full album, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, was released in January 2015.
In 2018, Lennox released the vinyl-only A Day With the Homies EP, a collection of five songs heavily influenced by house + bass music. Included on the packaging of the release were hidden URLs that pointed to samples used on the EP. In February 2019, he released the LP Buoys, featuring production work by longtime collaborator Rusty Santos. It was preceded by the single ""Dolphin"".

Outside musical collaborations
Lennox plays in the band Jane and Together with DJ Scott Mou. He has also performed on tracks with Atlas Sound (Bradford Cox of Deerhunter), Ducktails (Matt Mondanile, best known as the former lead guitarist of the American indie rock band Real Estate) and electronic musicians Zomby and Pantha du Prince.
Panda Bear appeared on the track ""Doin' It Right"" on the 2013 Daft Punk album Random Access Memories. The album won Daft Punk the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2014, making Panda Bear a co-winner. Almost a decade later, Lennox worked with previous Daft Punk collaborators Alan Braxe and DJ Falcon on their new duo's debut single, ""Step By Step"", in 2022.

Personal life
In 2004, Lennox moved from New York City to Lisbon, Portugal. He first visited the city for a vacation following a long Animal Collective tour in 2003. Lennox says about Lisbon: ""Since I got off the airplane here [for the first time] I had a good feeling about this place."" He met his ex-wife, the fashion designer Fernanda Pereira, there; after visiting each other in Lisbon and New York, Lennox decided to move to Europe because he also felt ""connected to the European way of life"", considering himself as a ""slow moving kind of person"" and Lisbon as a ""slow moving kind of place"". Lennox and Pereira have a daughter, Nadja, born in 2005 and a son, born in June 2010. In 2007, he and Pereira collaborated on a line of sweatshirts called 2nd Things. Pereira also directed music videos for his songs ""Playing the Long Game"" and ""Danger"", off 2022's Reset with Sonic Boom. Shortly after, Lennox described the song as ""having a sweetness that is very bitter now"", indicating that the couple is no longer together.  
As of 2023, Lennox is in a relationship with Rivka Ravede from the band 
The Spirit of the Beehive, who toured with Animal Collective in 2022.

Patrick O'Hearn,"Patrick John O'Hearn (born September 6, 1954) is an American multi-instrumentalist, composer, and recording artist.
Known primarily as a bass guitarist and keyboardist, O'Hearn came to prominence with Frank Zappa and co-founded the early 1980s new wave band Missing Persons with several other veterans from Zappa's bands. O'Hearn's musical repertoire spans a diverse range including new-age. In addition to solo albums, he has composed soundtracks for movies and television.

Biography
Formative years
Born in Los Angeles, California and raised in the Pacific Northwest, O'Hearn began his professional music career at age 15 when he joined the Musicians Union and began playing night clubs in Portland, Oregon. Upon graduating from Sunset High School in 1972, he moved to Seattle, Washington. There, he briefly attended Cornish College of the Arts and, as well, studied privately with bassist Gary Peacock.
In 1973, he moved to San Francisco, California and soon became involved in the Bay Area jazz scene of that time, playing bass for established artists Charles Lloyd, Joe Henderson, Dexter Gordon, Joe Pass, Woody Shaw, Eddie Henderson, and Bobby Hutcherson. He also collaborated with musicians his own age, including Terry Bozzio, Mark Isham and Peter Maunu.
While on tour in Los Angeles in 1976, O'Hearn met musician Frank Zappa, who offered him a job as bass player in his band—a position he held for over two years. During this period, O’Hearn shifted from the acoustic bass to the electric bass guitar, and also became increasingly interested in electronic music. Zappa encouraged O’Hearn to explore his collection of synthesizers, and also introduced him to the technical aspects of music production, audio engineering, and home studio audio recording equipment.
In 1979, O'Hearn teamed with trumpet player Mark Isham and guitarist Peter Maunu to form Group 87. They only produced two LPs—Group 87 in 1980, and A Career in Dada Processing in 1984. Isham and Maunu would appear as collaborators on several of O'Hearn's subsequent solo releases.

1980s and solo career
In 1981, drummer and former Zappa bandmate Terry Bozzio invited O’Hearn to join his emerging new wave band, Missing Persons along with guitarist and fellow Zappa alumnus Warren Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio, who had performed vocals in several Zappa productions and recently married Terry. O'Hearn shifted from electric bass to synthesizers. Missing Persons recorded three albums for Capitol Records: Spring Session M (1982), Rhyme & Reason (1984), and Color In Your Life (1986). The band dissolved in early 1986; subsequently, O'Hearn joined with former Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor and former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones for one album, Thunder (1987), and a brief tour.
O'Hearn's solo career was spurred in large part by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann, who had been conceiving of a new music label that would showcase progressive instrumental music—a niche earlier explored by Group 87. Baumann formed the Private Music label in late 1984, and produced O'Hearn's debut solo album, Ancient Dreams (1985).
O'Hearn followed Ancient Dreams with two more albums—Between Two Worlds (1987), which earned the artist his first Grammy nomination, and Rivers Gonna Rise (1988). O'Hearn began to receive greater airplay on jazz and new-age radio stations. O'Hearn also co-produced several tracks for guitarist Colin Chin's Intruding on a Silence, featuring Mark Isham on trumpet. O'Hearn released his fourth solo album Eldorado in 1989, which blended elements of World Music with warm keyboard textures.

1990s
The next O'Hearn release was Indigo in 1991. Winding up their contract, Private Music assembled a compilation album in 1992 titled The Private Music of Patrick O'Hearn. This album included three previously unreleased tracks titled ""Down Hill Racer"", ""Irene"", and ""Step"".
In 1992, O'Hearn composed and performed the music score for White Sands, a police thriller starring Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson. The film was directed by Roger Donaldson. Later that year he composed the score to Silent Tongue, written and directed by Sam Shepard and starring Alan Bates, Richard Harris, River Phoenix and Dermot Mulroney.
O'Hearn released Trust in 1995 under the newly formed Deep Cave record label. Featuring contributions from David Torn and former bandmates Terry Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo, Trust earned O'Hearn his second Grammy nomination. Shortly after the release of his next album, Metaphor (1996), the Deep Cave record label folded. Also released in 1996 was the soundtrack to the film Crying Freeman.
There have been a few various artists albums that O'Hearn has contributed new material to. In 1998, his 12-minute composition ""35th Parallel"" appeared on the five-artist album The Ambient Expanse. In 2000, his version of a Johann Sebastian Bach piece called ""Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1"" appeared on the compilation A Different Prelude: A Contemporary Collection. In 2003 his version of the Joaquín Rodrigo composition ""Adagio from Fantasy for a Gentleman"" appeared on the compilation Adagio: A Windham Hill Collection. This last track can also be found on the various artists compilation Sundown: Windham Hill Piano Collection, released in 2006.

2000s
O'Hearn's next solo project, So Flows the Current (2001), was recorded over a three-year period from 1997 to 2000.
In 2002, cinematographer David Fortney created a film of landscape images paired with O'Hearn music. The result was Timeless - A National Parks Odyssey which was released on DVD in 2002. This also includes a new version of the track ""Beauty In Darkness,"" originally from O'Hearn's debut album.
Beautiful World was O'Hearn's next release in 2003, and it was voted the No. 1 album on the nationally syndicated radio program Echoes. This was followed by Slow Time in 2005.
In 2006, O'Hearn released three recordings via iTunes online delivery only. The first two of these are the soundtrack EP to Sean Garland's short film The Wheelhouse, and the soundtrack album to the Sam Shepard stage play Simpatico (originally recorded in 1994). These were followed by The So Flows Sessions, which is a full-length album of previously unreleased material from the recording sessions in 1997–2000 that produced So Flows The Current.
The next year in 2007 O'Hearn released the CD Glaciation, inspired by images of Earth's Arctic regions. In the summer of 2007, O'Hearn was introduced to singer-songwriter John Hiatt and played bass on Hiatt's Same Old Man album. Hiatt subsequently asked him to join his band and tour in support of the album's 2008 release. O'Hearn continued to tour with Hiatt through 2010 and recorded on his following releases: The Open Road (2010), Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns (2011), and Mystic Pinball (2012).

2010s
O'Hearn's 13th album Transitions was released digitally on August 23, 2011, and on CD on October 4. It was voted No.1 album of 2011 on the Echoes Listener's Poll.
In December 2013, a various artists album titled Nashville Indie Spotlight was released, which includes a new piece by Patrick O'Hearn and Peter Maunu called ""Out of Reach"". 
His daughter, Rachel, is an electronic musician, performing under the names Chromatiq and Black Sound Effects.

2020s
In October 2020, Patrick O’Hearn released a new track online titled “Rivulet”, which also had a second version titled “Rivulet (Tranquility Mix)”.

Paul Winter,"Paul Winter (born August 31, 1939) is an American saxophonist, composer, and bandleader. He is a pioneer of world music and earth music, which interweaves the voices of the wild with instrumental voices from classical, jazz and world music. The music is often improvised and recorded in nature to reflect the qualities brought into play by the environment.

Early life
Winter was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, United States. He studied piano and clarinet, then fell in love with saxophone in the fourth grade. He started the Little German Band with his schoolmates when he was twelve, then a Dixieland band, and a nine-piece dance band known as The Silver Liners. He became enthralled by big bands and bebop bands of the 1950s. After graduating from Altoona Area High School in 1957, he spent the summer on a tour of state fairs in the Midwest with the conductor and members of the Ringling Brothers Circus Band.

Paul Winter Sextet
At Northwestern University, he majored in English and visited jazz clubs in Chicago. In 1961, his sextet won the Intercollegiate Jazz Festival and was signed by Columbia Records. He was accepted by the University of Virginia Law School, but postponed that plan when during the next year the sextet went on a goodwill tour of Latin America, as cultural ambassadors for the United States State Department, playing 160 concerts in 23 countries. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy invited the band to perform at the White House. The performance in the East Room on November 19, 1962 was the first jazz concert in the White House. In the mid-1960s, Winter lived for a year in Brazil. It became a second home for him and he recorded several albums there. Rio was released in 1965 with liner notes by Vinicius de Moraes.

Paul Winter Consort
In 1967 he started the Paul Winter Consort, influenced by Heitor Villa-Lobos and other Brazilian music, to give ensemble playing and soloing equal importance, analogous to a democracy where every voice would count. He borrowed the name from English Elizabethan theater of the 16th and 17th centuries, when bands combined woodwinds, strings, and percussion, the same families of instruments he wanted to combine in his contemporary consort. With this group, he became one of the earliest creators of world music.
Recordings of humpback whales in 1968 influenced his music, and his desire to become an environment activist. In 1977, his album Common Ground was his first to incorporate sounds of whales, eagles, and wolves into his music. The Paul Winter Consort recorded during the 1960s and 1970s. Four albums for A&M were produced by Phil Ramone and Paul Stookey. Astronauts of Apollo 15 took the Consort's album Road to the moon with them and named two craters after the songs ""Ghost Beads"" and ""Icarus"". George Martin produced the album Icarus and considered it one of the best he produced. The band Oregon was formed by band members who worked on this album: Ralph Towner, Paul McCandless, Glen Moore, and Collin Walcott.
In the early 1980s, Winter began traveling to the Soviet Union. In 1984, he ventured as far as Lake Baikal in Siberia, and found it so beautiful that he returned to try to protect it. In 1984, he became friends with Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Winter took part in the U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge to encourage collaboration between Russians and Americans. On a tour of the Soviet Union in 1986, the Consort performed with the Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble at Moscow University. During the next year the two bands recorded the album EarthBeat in Moscow and New York. It was the first album of music created together by Americans and Russians.
In 1980, Winter founded Living Music Records as a forum for his musical and ecological vision. The name alludes to his desire to make timeless music in natural acoustic spaces like stone churches, canyons, and barns.

Artist-in-residence
Winter is a member of the Lindisfarne Association, founded by William Irwin Thompson, of scientists, artists, scholars, and contemplatives devoted to the study and realization of a planetary culture. Through this organization, Winter met the Very Reverend James Parks Morton, Dean of New York City's Cathedral of St. John the Divine. In 1980, Dean Morton invited him to become artist-in-residence there, to build bridges between spirituality and the environment with his music. St. John the Divine Cathedral is the largest gothic cathedral in the world and known as ""the green cathedral."" In the 1980s and 1990s, it became the center of a vital community of thinkers and seekers working on issues of ecology and environment and world peace. Cosmologist Father Thomas Berry influenced Winter and affirmed his intent to awaken in people as sense of community.
Since 1980, Winter and the Paul Winter Consort have presented over 100 events at the Cathedral, including ""Tao of Bach"" with Al Huang, Carnival for the Rainforest, and with tightrope walker Philippe Petit. Every year on the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi a choir of hundreds of voices, gospel singer Theresa Thomason, and the Forces of Nature Dance Theatre join the Consort in a liturgical performance of Winter's ecological and ecumenical Missa Gaia (Earth Mass). The major movements of the mass are based on the voices of whale, harp seal, and wolf.

Earth music
In 1968, when he attended a lecture on whale songs by Roger Payne at Rockefeller University in New York City, Payne and Scott McVay discovered that humpbacks produce sounds in intricate patterns that fit the definition of ""songs."" These change over time and represent a cultural tradition passed orally from one whale to the next. Winter was thrilled by the soulful beauty of these humpback whale voices, in much the same way as when he had first heard jazz saxophonists like Charlie Parker. Listening to the long, complex songs the whales repeat, he was amazed by their musical intelligence, and shocked to learn that these extraordinary creatures were rapidly being hunted to extinction. They opened the door to the whole symphony of nature and changed the direction of Winter's musical life.
Another milestone was hearing Roger Payne's 1970 album, Songs of the Humpback Whale, which popularized the whale songs, and was perhaps the greatest single contribution to awakening humanity to whales. The grandfather of all natural sound recordings, and a bestseller, it touched the hearts of millions of people throughout the world. (Winter believed that it contributed more, perhaps, towards saving whales and sea mammals than all other efforts put together, and re-released the album on his Living Music label in 1990.)
During the 1970s, Winter became involved in the movement to bring awareness of whales and their extraordinary music to the world. In late 1976, Governor Jerry Brown declared Whale Day"" in California. He convened a three day whale conference in Sacramento, bringing together biologists such as John Lily; filmmakers; environmentalists; poets, including Gary Snyder; musicians such as Joni Mitchell and the Paul Winter Consort; and fans of the whales. During the early 1970s, as whale consciousness emerged in the culture, Japan began to come under widespread criticism for its continued whaling operations. From the Sacramento whale conference came the idea that, rather than boycott Japan, efforts should be made to communicate with Japanese environmentalists and share with them the growing body of information about whales and why they should be protected. This resulted the next April in a large contingent of biologists and musicians (including the Paul Winter Consort, Mimi Fariña, Jackson Browne, and the fusion band, Stuff, featuring Steve Gadd), along with Governor Brown, traveling to Tokyo for a week of performances. Called ""Japan Celebrates the Whale and Dolphin,"" it was reportedly the first environmental event ever held in Japan.
Winter traveled to Japan several times with the ""Save the Whale"" campaign; played benefits for Greenpeace and other organizations; and led music-making and whale-watching workshops on Cape Cod and in Baja California. In 1975, Winter sailed aboard the Greenpeace V anti-whaling expedition for three days of playing saxophone to wild gray whales off the coast of Vancouver Island (Tofino). He was accompanied in this effort by Melville Gregory and Will Jackson, musicians attempting to ""communicate"" with the whales using various instruments and a Serge synthesizer. Photos of Winter and the whales [by Rex Weyler] appeared on wire services and in media around the world, helping the ultimate success of the mission against Soviet whalers.
In 1978, Winter released Common Ground, an album that combined his music and animal sounds (wolves, eagles, and whales). In 1980, a chance encounter with a wild sea lion pup off Baja California affected Winter deeply, and inspired him to explore the realm of pinnipeds and the role of sound in their lives, in the same way he had immersed himself in learning about whales and wolves. He spent three years observing, listening to, and occasionally playing his saxophone to sea mammals. His research expeditions took him to Newfoundland, British Columbia, Scotland's Inner Hebrides, the California coastal islands, San Salvador in the Bahamas, and twice again to Magdalena Island in Baja California. The resulting album, Callings, helped initiate a successful campaign to have Congress designate March 1 each year as ""The Day of the Seal.""
A further collaboration with Dr. Roger Payne resulted in the album Whales Alive!, with actor Leonard Nimoy, It realized a long-standing dream shared by Payne and Winter to create an entire album of music based on melodies by whales. The album intersperses readings of prose and poetry about whales with music improvised in response to recordings of the whale voices, extending the whale melodies in a way similar to how the whales themselves gradually change and grow their long, complex songs.
In 1990, Paul convinced Roger Payne to come to Japan to various whaling cities, including Shoji and Ogasawara to tour a joint program showing how whale watching could be a viable business alternative to whale-killing.

In late 1968, Winter saw wolves for the first time in the Redding, Connecticut, middle school, at a program given by John Harris. Harris was touring the country to raise awareness about wolves and trying to counter the prejudice that was responsible for the extermination of these creatures from the wild. Looking into the eyes of the wolf as it sat in the back of Harris' van after the program, Winter was inspired to write his piece ""Wolf Eyes."" It presented the lyrical voice of the wolf, and a different, gentle, image of a creature so long misunderstood and vilified by humans.
In 1973, at a wildlife conference in St. Louis, Winter met wolf biologist Fred Harrington, who invited him to Minnesota, where Winter heard wolves in the wild for the first time. In the mid-1970s, at a wolf preserve in the mountains of California, a captive wolf named Ida howled a duet with Winter's soprano sax, and her voice was featured on the Common Ground album, Winter's first musical statement about the entire family of life, and the first album to feature voices of endangered species – symbolically representing with whale, wolf, and eagle the realms of sea, land, and air.
After the Redding program, Winter visited John Harris many times, and Harris and the wolves sometimes stayed on Winter's farm. During the 1978 Common Ground tour, Winter invited Harris to introduce his wolf on stage, including on September 8, 1978, at a benefit for the Audubon Society at Carnegie Hall, after which the wolf was featured on the front page of The New York Times.

Adventures in SoundPlay
In 1968, Winter began introducing improvisations into the Consort's concerts as a way for the group (cello, alto flute, English horn and sax) to play freely. The band would perform one ""free piece"" with all the lights turned out in every concert. This shared adventure into the unknown was often a high point with audiences. After the Consort was asked to do a residency of ""master classes"" at the Hartt School of Music in 1971, Winter began developing a process for unlocking the unique music inside each person, by creating safe, fun contexts for free interplay. He calls his workshops ""Adventures in SoundPlay"" No ""wrong notes"", no worship of virtuosity, the dissolving of fears – all these things served to open new paths. Winter has conducted about 300 of these sessions at music schools, universities, and at centers such as Esalen, Kripalu, Rowe, and Omega.

Awards
Winter has received a Global 500 Award from the United Nations, the Joseph Wood Krutch Medal from the United States Humane Society, the Peace Abbey's Courage of Conscience Award, the Spirit of the City Award presented at New York's Cathedral of St John the Divine, and an honorary Doctorate of Music from the University of Hartford. He also received the James Parks Morton Interfaith Award. Paul Winter received 6 Grammy Awards and 13 Grammy nominations between 1986 and 2010. Spanish Angel earned Winter his first Grammy Award in 1993 for Best New Age Album. His other Grammy wins were for the albums Prayer for the Wild Things (2005), Celtic Solstice (1999), Silver Solstice (2005), Crestone (2007), and Miho: Journey to the Mountain (2010).

Peter Buffett,"Peter Andrew Buffett (born May 4, 1958)[1] is an American musician, composer, author and philanthropist.  With a career that spans more than 30 years, Buffett is a Regional Emmy Award winner, New York Times best-selling author and co-chair of the NoVo Foundation. He is the youngest son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett.

Career
Early career
Buffett began his musical career in the early part of the 1980s in San Francisco, California. After dropping out of Stanford University, he used the proceeds of his inheritance from his grandfather to pursue a career in music. He recorded and produced albums for local talent.  His big break came when a neighbor introduced him to his son-in-law who needed ad tunes for a newly conceived station, MTV. The music channel became a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s. He also was hired by ad agencies to compose commercials and logos - including CNN, which like MTV was also new to cable television at the time.

Music career
1987–1995
Buffett decided to transition from ad to music and he decided that a way to do that is to get a record deal based on movie scores. As new age music was popular in the mid-1980s, he was able to secure one. Narada Productions, a new-age music recording company, signed Buffett to a recording contract.  In 1987, Buffett debuted with Narada, releasing an album entitled The Waiting.  His second album, One by One, was inspired by Evan S. Connell's book ""Son of the Morning Star"". In 1989, Buffett moved to Milwaukee, home of Narada Productions and closer to his childhood home in Omaha, Nebraska.  Buffett would release two more albums with Narada:  Lost Frontier and Yonnondio.
While with Narada, Buffett had his first major success scoring the ""Fire Dance"" scene in the film Dances with Wolves.  The film score, composed by John Barry, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Barry would later invite Buffett to collaborate with him again, this time at the Abbey Road Studios in London.  Buffett contributed the Indigenous soundscapes to the film, and went on to compose two songs for the soundtrack of The Scarlet Letter.
After the release of Yonnondio, Buffett signed with Epic Records. In 1994, he released his soundtrack for the CBS miniseries 500 Nations, which was produced by Kevin Costner.

1996–2005
In 1996, Buffett produced Star of Wonder, a Christmas CD featuring Celtic harpist Kim Robertson and arranger Eric Segnitz. Buffett then signed with Hollywood Records, which released his album Spirit Dance in 1997.
In 1998, he entered the pop music realm with the release of Comet9's ""Like Mercury"" on Milwaukee-based independent label Don't Records, with Buffett producing, writing and playing multi-instrumentalist.  Co-writer and guitarist Tom Nelson and vocalist Susan Zielke completed the studio trio, with Citizen King members D. J. Brooks and Malcolm Michiles guesting on drums and turntables, respectively. The live band added bassist Josh Warner to the lineup.
In 1999, Buffett's score for the documentary Wisconsin: An American Portrait won a Chicago / Midwest Emmy Award for Best Soundtrack.
Also in 1999, Buffett's Spirit – A Journey in Dance Drums and Song aired on PBS as a highly successful pledge break special. Combining modern and American Indian dancers with Director and Choreographer Wayne Cilento, Spirit went on to tour through the end of 1999. In 2004, Buffett worked with Jody Ripplinger and Frank Anderson to create Spirit –The Seventh Fire; an updated version of his earlier show. It was premiered on the National Mall during the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in its 800-seat theater tent.

2006–present
In 2006, Buffett released his first vocal album, Gold Star. Over the course of the next two years, he released two more albums, Staring at the Sun (2007) and Imaginary Kingdom (2008) on his own label BeSide Records.
In 2009, Buffett began to release exclusive singles through his social networking community on Ning. He has released over 25 singles since then, including a compilation album of fifteen of the songs.  The collection, released initially as a USB album, was titled Running Blind (2011) and contained an innovative interactive environment.
During this time he collaborated twice with Grammy-nominated recording artist Akon and once with Grammy-winning artist Angélique Kidjo on human rights inspired songs. One Akon collaboration, titled “Blood Into Gold,” debuted at a special event at the UN General Assembly in March 2009 that focused on human trafficking.
In 2013, Peter released ""Already Flown"" which was the inspiration behind his New York Times op-ed piece, The Charitable-Industrial Complex. The piece sparked a lively debate on the role of philanthropy.

Concert and conversation
Peter, along with cellist Michael Kott, is currently touring around the world in support of his Life Is What You Make It: A Concert & Conversation with Peter Buffett performance. Buffett continues to visit numerous university campuses, community foundations and other organizations using his own life story and experiences as illustration. He discusses how important it is for each person to define his or her own path, regardless of their wealth or background, and ultimately conveys that it’s one’s values — and what we are able to give back to society — that shape and define us as individuals.

Author
In May 2010, his book, Life Is What You Make It: Find Your Own Path to Fulfillment, was published with Random House/Crown Publishing. The book was praised by Ted Turner, former President Bill Clinton, Bill and Melinda Gates, and Gloria Steinem, among others. It has sold over half a million copies worldwide, peaking at number four on The New York Times Best Sellers List. It has been available in over fifteen languages. Buffett appeared on NPR, as well as The Today Show and CBS Sunday Morning with his father, to discuss the book.
In 2013, Buffett began contributing essays to the Huffington Post Impact blog.

Work with other artists
During the 1980s, Buffett was the sound engineer on three albums by Pauline Anna Strom, which included Plot Zero.

Personal life
Family
Peter Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and is the youngest child of investor Warren Buffett and Susan Thompson Buffett. He has two siblings: sister Susie and brother Howard. Buffett graduated from Omaha Central High School and attended Stanford University.
He was married to his first wife, Mary Buffett, for 12 years before they divorced in 1993. Mary's twin daughters from a previous relationship, Erica and Nicole, were four years old at the time of their wedding. Subsequently, Peter Buffett legally adopted the girls. He married Jennifer Buffett in June 1996.

Philanthropy
Buffett and his wife are co-chairmen of the NoVo Foundation, an organization that aims to empower and reduce violence against girls and women.
In a 2013 New York Times op-ed and radio podcast, The Charitable-Industrial Complex, Peter Buffett uses the terms ""philanthropic colonialism"" and ""conscience laundering,"" and describes his insights into ""searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left"" rather than systemic change.

Peter Buffett interview with Laura Flanders (November 26, 2013)"
Peter Gabriel,"Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer, songwriter and human rights activist. He was the original lead singer of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving the band in 1975, he launched a solo career with ""Solsbury Hill"" as his first single. His fifth studio album, So (1986), is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album's most successful single, ""Sledgehammer"", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and, according to a report in 2011, it was MTV's most played music video of all time.
Gabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single ""Biko"". He has participated in several human-rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the Witness human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.
Gabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his ""influence on generations of music makers"". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic described Gabriel as ""one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political"". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, and as a solo artist in 2014. In March 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of his achievements in music.

Early life
Peter Brian Gabriel was born on 13 February 1950 in Chobham, Surrey, England, son of Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912–2012) and Edith Irene (1921–2016), daughter of Colonel Edward Allen, chairman of the Civil Service Department Store on the Strand, London. Gabriel's father was an electrical engineer and dairy farm-owner from a long-established family of London timber importers and merchants, and his mother was from a musical family. Gabriel was raised at Deep Pool Farm, Coxhill, a Victorian manor just outside Chobham. His great-great-great-uncle, Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet, was Lord Mayor of London from 1866 to 1877. Gabriel attended Cable House, a private primary school in Woking, Surrey, followed by St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in Horsell, Surrey. During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.
Gabriel remarked of his early influences, ""Hymns played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to soul music before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back."" At age 12, Gabriel wrote his first song, ""Sammy the Slug"". Around this time, an aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons, but he used it to buy the Beatles' debut studio album Please Please Me (1963). In September 1963, he started at Charterhouse, a public school in Godalming, Surrey. There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band: the trad jazz outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word.
In 1965, Gabriel formed Garden Wall with school friends Tony Banks on piano and Chris Stewart on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel; the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At a final concert before they broke up, Gabriel, dressed in a kaftan and beads, showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens.

Career
1967–1975: Genesis
In 1967, after Garden Wall had disbanded, Gabriel, Banks and Stewart were invited by fellow pupils Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford to work on a demo tape of songs. Gabriel and Banks contributed ""She Is Beautiful"", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to former Charterhouse pupil turned musician Jonathan King, who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested a band name of Gabriel's Angels, but it was unpopular with the other members. They settled on King's other suggestion, Genesis. After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote ""The Silent Sun"" as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis's first single, released in 1968. It was included on their debut studio album, From Genesis to Revelation (1968), which saw Gabriel play the flute.
After the commercial failure of From Genesis to Revelation, the band went their separate ways, and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse. In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time working band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on Mona Bone Jakon (1970) by Cat Stevens. The second studio album by Genesis, Trespass (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the accordion, tambourine and bass drum, and incorporating his soul music influences. He wrote the lyrics to ""The Knife"" as a parody of a protest song. The album sold little and at one point, Gabriel secured a place at London School of Film Technique because Genesis ""seemed to be dying."" Genesis recruited guitarist Steve Hackett and drummer Phil Collins. Their next studio album, Nursery Cryme (1971), features Gabriel playing the oboe. Its opener, ""The Musical Box"", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics.

The shows featuring Foxtrot (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. He had started to recite stories to introduce numbers as a way to cover the silence between songs, while the band tuned their instruments, or while technical faults were being fixed. During a gig in Dublin in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of ""The Musical Box"" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. He kept the idea to himself as he felt the band would have voted against it. Despite some initial doubts from his bandmates, the incident received front-page coverage in Melody Maker, giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, Genesis Live (1973). By late 1973, following the success of Selling England by the Pound (1973), which centred on English themes and literary and materialistic references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for ""Watcher of the Skies"", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for ""Dancing with the Moonlit Knight"", various costumes for ""Supper's Ready"", and an old-man mask for ""The Musical Box"".
The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) was Gabriel's final studio album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and the bizarre incidents and characters he meets on the way. Tensions increased during this period as Gabriel wanted to write all of the lyrics himself, and split with the band after film director William Friedkin had invited him to work on a screenplay. The project dissolved, and Gabriel returned to work with Genesis. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. In the end, Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. In the liner notes, Gabriel is credited with ""experiments with foreign sounds"". He had Brian Eno provide additional electronic effects.
During a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band. The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled ""Out, Angels Out"", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family. The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him. His exit resulted in drummer Phil Collins reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.

1975–1985: Solo debut with four self-titled albums
Gabriel described his break from the music business as his ""learning period"", during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975, the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall. After preparing material for a studio album Gabriel recorded his solo debut, Peter Gabriel, in 1976 and 1977 in Toronto and London, with producer Bob Ezrin.
Gabriel did not title his first four studio albums. All were labelled Peter Gabriel, using the same typeface, with designs by Hipgnosis. ""The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year,"" he remarked in 1978. ""So it's the same title, the same lettering in the same place; only the photo is different."" Each album has, however, been given a nickname by fans, usually relating to the album cover.
Peter Gabriel (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 1: Car) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, ""Solsbury Hill"", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of Solsbury Hill in Somerset. ""It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get ..."" said Gabriel. ""It's about letting go."" Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson often playing off stage and introduced as ""Dusty Rhodes"".

In late 1977, Gabriel started recording the second Peter Gabriel studio album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch) in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its ""Mother of Violence"" was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.
Gabriel recorded the third Peter Gabriel studio album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt) in England in 1979. He had developed an interest in African music and drum machines and later hailed the record as his breakthrough. The album has been credited as the first to use gated reverb on the drums, creating a distinct sound. While recording drums on ""Intruder"", one of the tracks featuring Phil Collins, Gabriel had Collins play various rhythms without using cymbals for several minutes as a basis to develop the song further. Collins used the gated effect on his debut solo single ""In the Air Tonight"" which became a signature sound in the 1980s and beyond.
Atlantic Records—Gabriel's US distributor, which had released his first two studio albums—refused to put it out. ""An American A&R person came over in the middle of recording and—other than attempting to make one track sound like the Doobie Brothers, which he failed considerably to do—he was convinced that the thing was much too [adopts American accent] 'esoteric, Peter'... He wasn't convinced then that they would want to do anything with it. And, sure enough, when it was sent over there, it was given the big elbow.""
Gabriel signed a recording contract with Mercury Records. Released in May 1980, the album went to No. 1 in the UK for three weeks. In the US, it peaked at No. 22. The single ""Games Without Frontiers"" went to No. 4 and ""Biko"" went to No. 36 in the UK. After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel's first instance of crowd surfing when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows.

On Peter Gabriel four (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 4: Security), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, Ashcombe House, in Somerset. Gabriel utilized a Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. ""Over the course of the last two albums,"" he observed, ""I've got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writing—particularly with the invention of these drum machines—is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you're doing.""
The fourth Peter Gabriel, released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, ""Shock the Monkey"", became Gabriel's first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with Geffen Records, which—initially unbeknown to Gabriel—titled the album Security to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel's 1982 tour lasted a year and became his first to make a profit. Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel's debut live release, Plays Live (1983).
Gabriel produced versions of the third and fourth Peter Gabriel albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered.
In 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for Alan Parker's drama film Birdy (1984), co-produced with Daniel Lanois. This consisted of new material, without lyrics, as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album.

1985–1997: So and Us
After finishing the soundtrack to Birdy, Gabriel shifted his musical focus from rhythm and texture, as heard on Peter Gabriel four and Birdy, towards more straightforward songs. In 1985, he recorded his fifth studio album, So (also co-produced with Lanois). So was released in May 1986 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. It remains Gabriel's best-selling album with over five million copies sold in the US alone. It produced three UK top 20 singles: ""Sledgehammer"", ""Big Time"" and ""Don't Give Up"", a duet with Kate Bush. The first went to No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, Gabriel's only single of his career to do so. It knocked ""Invisible Touch"" by Genesis, his former band, out of the top spot, which was also their only US number one hit. In the UK, the single went to No. 4. In 1990, Rolling Stone ranked So at No. 14 on its list of ""Top 100 Albums of the Eighties"".

""Sledgehammer"" was particularly successful, dealing with sex and sexual relations through lyrical innuendos. Its famed music video was a collaboration between director Stephen R. Johnson, Aardman Animations, and the Brothers Quay and won a record nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987. In 1998, it was named MTV's number one animated video of all time. So earned Gabriel two wins at the 1987 Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video (for ""Sledgehammer""). He was nominated for four Grammy Awards: Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year for ""Sledgehammer"", and Album of the Year for So. Gabriel toured worldwide to support So with the This Way Up Tour, from November 1986 to October 1987.
In 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present ""the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way"". Gabriel used musicians from WOMAD to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern and European textures, using the National Sound Archive in London for additional inspiration. The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record. When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as Passion in June 1989. It won Gabriel a Grammy Award for Best New Age Performance and a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score – Motion Picture. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats, which sold 2 million copies in the US.
Up until 1989, Gabriel was managed by Gail Colson. From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to So, titled Us. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.
Gabriel's introspection within the context of the album Us can be seen in the first single release ""Digging in the Dirt"" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a disturbing video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous studio album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in ""Come Talk to Me"" directed by Matt Mahurin, which featured backing vocals by Sinéad O'Connor. O'Connor also lent vocals to ""Blood of Eden"", directed by Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to Adam's rib for inspiration.
The album is one of Gabriel's most personal. It met with less success than So, reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles ""Digging in the Dirt"" and the funkier ""Steam"", which evoked memories of ""Sledgehammer"". Gabriel followed the release of the album with the Secret World Tour, first using touring keyboardist Joy Askew to sing O'Connor's part, then O'Connor herself for a few months. O'Connor quit the tour, and was replaced by Paula Cole, the latter appearing on the tour recordings: a double album Secret World Live, and a concert video also called Secret World Live, both released in 1994.
Gabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the Us album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as Helen Chadwick, Rebecca Horn, Nils-Udo, Andy Goldsworthy, David Mach and Yayoi Kusama collaborated to create original artworks for each of the 11 songs on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video All About Us and the interactive CD-ROM Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World.
Gabriel won three more Grammy Awards, all in the Music Video category. He won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to ""Digging in the Dirt"" and ""Steam"", respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for his Secret World Live video.

1997–2009: OVO and Up
In 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the Millennium Dome Show, a live multimedia performance staged in the Millennium Dome in London throughout 2000. Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting. He also felt that management, while succeeding to get the building finished on time, failed to understand the artistic side of the show and its content. Gabriel's soundtrack was released as OVO in June 2000. The Story of OVO was released in the CD-booklet-shaped comic book which was part of the CD edition with the title ""OVO The Millennium Show"".
Around that same time, the Genesis greatest hits album, Turn It On Again: The Hits (1999), featured Gabriel sharing vocals with Phil Collins on a new version of ""The Carpet Crawlers"" entitled ""The Carpet Crawlers 1999"", produced by Trevor Horn.
In 2002 he stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) with worldbeat music. Released in June 2002, Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score – Motion Picture.
Later in 2002, Up, Gabriel's first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at Virgin Records pushed Gabriel to complete it. Up reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: Growing Up Live (2003) and Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2005).
In 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford and Collins to organise the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Gabriel produced and performed at the Eden Project Live 8 concert in July 2005. He joined Cat Stevens on stage to perform ""Wild World"" during Nelson Mandela's 46664 concert. In 2005, FIFA asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Gabriel performed John Lennon's ""Imagine"".
In November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Rome presented Gabriel with the Man of Peace award. The award, presented by former General Secretary of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev and Walter Veltroni, Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel's extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician Moby. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel's contribution to music was described as ""vast and enduring.""

Gabriel took on a project with the BBC World Service's competition ""The Next Big Thing"" to find the world's best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with William Orbit, Geoff Travis and Angélique Kidjo.
In June 2008, Gabriel released Big Blue Ball, an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s. He planned its release in the US without assistance from a label; he raised £2 million towards the recording and distribution of the album with Ingenious Media with the worldwide release handled through Warner Bros. Records. Gabriel appeared on a nationwide tour for the album in 2009.
Gabriel was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.
Gabriel contributed to the Pixar film WALL-E soundtrack in 2008 with Thomas Newman, including the film's closing song, ""Down to Earth"", for which they received the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the 2008 Academy Awards telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of ""Down to Earth"" from WALL-E to 90 seconds. According to Gabriel, his window was reduced to 65 seconds. John Legend and the Soweto Gospel Choir performed the song in his stead.
Gabriel's 2009 tour appearances included Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Venezuela. His first ever performance in Peru was held in Lima on 20 March 2009, during his second visit to the country. His concert in Mexico City, on 27 March 2009, attracted more than 38,000 fans.
On 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness. The show included two tracks from the then-forthcoming Scratch My Back: Paul Simon's ""The Boy in the Bubble"" and the Magnetic Fields' ""The Book of Love"".

2009–2019: Scratch My Back, New Blood and further side projects
In 2009, Gabriel recorded Scratch My Back, an album of cover songs by various artists including David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor and Neil Young. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists' song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as I'll Scratch Yours, but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold. Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with John Metcalfe. Released in February 2010, Scratch My Back reached No. 12 in the UK. Gabriel toured worldwide with the New Blood Tour from March 2010 to July 2012 with a 54-piece orchestra and his daughter Melanie and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun on backing vocals. The follow-up, And I'll Scratch Yours, was released in September 2013.
During the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the Scratch My Back concept and, with Metcalfe's assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, New Blood, was released in October 2011.
In September 2012, Gabriel kicked off his Back to Front Tour which featured So (1986) performed in its entirety with the original musicians who played on the album, to mark its 25th anniversary. When the opening leg finished a month later, Gabriel took one year off to travel the world with his children. The tour resumed with a European leg from September 2013 to December 2014.
In 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. They performed Gabriel's ""Washing of the Water"" together. Gabriel performed ""Heroes"" by David Bowie with an orchestra at a concert in Berlin to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2014.
In 2016, he was featured on the song ""A.I."" by American pop rock band OneRepublic from their fourth studio album Oh My My.
In June 2016, Gabriel released the single ""I'm Amazing"". The song was written several years prior, in part as a tribute to boxer Muhammad Ali. That month, he embarked on a joint tour with Sting titled The Rock Paper Scissors North American Tour.
Gabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of Rated PG, a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career. The song selection spans over 30 years and includes tracks that had never been released on an official Gabriel album previously, including ""Down to Earth"" (from WALL-E) and ""That'll Do"" (from Babe: Pig in the City), an Oscar-nominated collaboration with Randy Newman. Initially only released on vinyl for Record Store Day on 13 April, the album was eventually released on digital streaming services later that month. Later that same year, Gabriel issued another digital release on 13 September titled Flotsam and Jetsam, a collection of B-sides, remixes and rarities that span Gabriel's entire solo career from 1976 to 2016, including his first solo recording, a cover of the Beatles' song ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".

2022–present: I/O and possible follow-up album
By 2002, Gabriel had been continually working on what he had given the tentative title of I/O, his tenth studio album, which he had begun work on as early as 1995. It was originally set to be released 18 months after Up, but touring pushed the release far away. He did an interview with Rolling Stone in 2005 stating that he had 150 songs in various stages. From 2013 to 2016, he posted regularly on social media about recording the new album. In 2019, he spoke on BBC Radio 6 about how he had taken a hiatus from making music due to his wife being sick, but he had begun to return to it now that she had recovered. In 2021, he was interviewed multiple times about his new album, and revealed that he had been recording with Manu Katché, Tony Levin and David Rhodes on 17 new songs. He posted multiple photos to his Facebook and Instagram of these sessions. In June 2022, Katché told the French magazine L'Illustré that the album was nearly complete and would be released later that year, pending an official announcement.
In November 2022, Gabriel announced his upcoming ""I/O the Tour"" for the spring of 2023 across several European cities, with later dates to be confirmed for the North America leg of the tour for the late summer/fall of 2023. This announcement also confirmed the name of the upcoming album to be stylised as I/O. The first single from the album, ""Panopticom"", was released digitally on 6 January 2023. A new piece from the album will be released on the date of each full moon in 2023, as well as a different mix of the song on each new moon in 2023, starting with the Dark Side Mix of ""Panopticom"". On 5 February, Gabriel released ""The Court"", the second single from the album. On 7 March, Gabriel released the third single, ""Playing for Time"". A basic arrangement of the song featuring only Gabriel on piano and Levin on bass had already opened the shows on the Back to Front Tour, by the name of ""Daddy Long Legs"". The title track ""I/O"" was the fourth single released on 6 April. On 5 May, Peter Gabriel released the fifth single from the album, ""Four Kinds of Horses"", a track which is a collaboration with Brian Eno and Richard Russell. The sixth single, ""Road to Joy"", was released on 4 June. Six more singles were released, separately, within the next six months—""So Much"", ""Olive Tree"", ""Love Can Heal"", ""This Is Home"", ""And Still"" and ""Live and Let Live""—before I/O was finally released on 1 December 2023.
One day prior to I/O's release, Gabriel told The New York Times that he does not expect a follow-up album (which he described as his ""brain project"") to take another 21 years, saying that ""there's a lot of stuff in the can"" but added that the material is not yet finished.
Additionally, Gabriel stated in his November 2023 Full Moon update video that the track ""What Lies Ahead"" will be on ""the next record"". He performed ""What Lies Ahead"" several times in 2023 and it was a contender for I/O.

Artistry
Stylistically, Gabriel's music has been alternately described by music writers as progressive rock, art rock, art pop, worldbeat, post-progressive and progressive soul. According to Rolling Stone journalist Ryan Reed, Gabriel has developed in all as an ""art-rock innovator, soul-pop craftsman, [and] 'world music' ambassador"" over the course of his career, while music scholar Gregg Akkermann argues that, despite his progressive rock origins, he has ""managed to attract fans from across the spectrum: prog rock, alternative rock, world beat, blue-eyed soul, dance music, the college crowd, the teens, Americans and Europeans"". More broadly, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine says Gabriel emerged during the 1980s as ""one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians"", as well as ""an international pop star"".
Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and Stick player Tony Levin has performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for Scratch My Back (2010), the soundtracks Passion (1989) and Long Walk Home (2002), and the New Blood Tour. Guitarist David Rhodes has been Gabriel's guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to So (1986), Jerry Marotta was Gabriel's preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the So and Us albums and tours Marotta was replaced by Manu Katché, who was then replaced by Ged Lynch on parts of the Up album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top-flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite and Lanois to musicians such as Natalie Merchant, Elizabeth Fraser, L. Shankar, Trent Reznor, Youssou N'Dour, Larry Fast, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sinéad O'Connor, Kate Bush, Ane Brun, Paula Cole, John Giblin, Dave Gregory, Peter Hammill, Papa Wemba, Manu Katché, Bayete, Milton Nascimento, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland and OneRepublic.
Over the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer Kate Bush several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel's ""Games Without Frontiers"" and ""No Self Control"" in 1980, and female lead vocal for ""Don't Give Up"" (a top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of Roy Harper's ""Another Day"" was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.
He also collaborated with avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson on two versions of her composition ""Excellent Birds""—one for her second album Mister Heartbreak (1984), and another version called ""This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)"", which appeared on cassette and CD versions of So.
Gabriel sang (along with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds) on ""Everywhere I Go"", from the Call's 1986 studio album, Reconciled. On Toni Childs' 1994 studio album, The Woman's Boat, Gabriel sang on the track, ""I Met a Man"".
In 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of Babe: Pig in the City as the lead vocalist of the song ""That'll Do"", written by Randy Newman. The song was nominated for an Academy Award, and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year's Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film Shall We Dance?, singing a cover version of ""The Book of Love"" by the Magnetic Fields.
In 1987, Gabriel appeared on Robbie Robertson's self-titled solo studio album, singing on ""Fallen Angel""; co-wrote two Tom Robinson singles; and appeared on Joni Mitchell's 1988 studio album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm, on the opening track ""My Secret Place"".
In 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song ""When You're Falling"" on Afro Celt Sound System's Volume 3: Further in Time. In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan.
Gabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician BT, who also worked on the OVO soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT's home in California. He also sang the lyrics for Deep Forest on their theme song for the movie Strange Days (1995). In addition, Gabriel has appeared on Angelique Kidjo's 2007 studio album Djin Djin, singing on the song ""Salala"".
Gabriel has recorded a cover of the Vampire Weekend single ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"" with Hot Chip, where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line ""But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too"" with ""It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name.""
Gabriel collaborated with Arcade Fire on their 2022 studio album, We. He sang backing vocals on the track ""Unconditional II (Race and Religion)"".

WOMAD and other projects
Gabriel's interest in world music was first apparent on his third solo studio album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in The Atlantic in 2019: ""When Peter Gabriel moved toward 'world music' four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as 'exotic,' and lyrics meant to change lives."" This influence has increased over time, and he is the driving force behind the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) movement. Gabriel said:

The first time I really got into music from another culture was as a result of the shifting of Radio 4, which I used to wake up to. I'd lost it on medium wave and was groping around in the morning on the dial, trying to find something that I could listen to, and came across a Dutch radio station who were playing the soundtrack from some obscure Stanley Baker movie called Dingaka. That had quite a lot of stuff from—I think it was—Ghana. I can't remember now, but it really moved me. One of the songs I heard on that was a thing called 'Shosholoza', which I recorded on the b-side of the 'Biko' single.
Gabriel created the Real World Studios and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as Yungchen Lhamo, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Youssou N'dour.
He has a longstanding interest in human rights and launched Witness, a charity that trains human rights activists to use video and online technologies to expose human rights abuses. In 2006, his work with WITNESS and his long-standing support of peace and human rights causes was recognised by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with the Man of Peace award.
In the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating Xplora (the world's largest-selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the EVE CD-ROM. EVE was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the Starwave Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d'Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996.
In 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile Geoffrey Oryema's ""Land of Anaka"", appearing on Oryema's first studio album Exile, released on Gabriel's Real World label.
In 1994, Gabriel starred in Breck Eisner's short film Recon as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer's identity.
Gabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting Georgia State University's Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with bonobo apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song ""Animal Nation"", which was performed on Gabriel's 2002 ""Growing Up"" tour and was featured on the Growing Up Live DVD and The Wild Thornberrys Movie soundtrack.) Gabriel's desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication.
He was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution (OD2), one of the first online music download services. Prior to its closure in 2009, its technology had been used by over 100 music download sites including MSN Music UK, MyCokeMusic, Planet Internet (KPN), Wanadoo and CD WOW!. OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant Nokia in October 2006 for $60 million.
Gabriel is co-founder (with Brian Eno) of a musicians union called Mudda, short for ""magnificent union of digitally downloading artists.""
In 2000, Gabriel collaborated with Zucchero, Anggun and others in a charity for kids with AIDS. Erick Benzi wrote words and music and Patrick Bruel, Stephan Eicher, Faudel, Lokua Kanza, Laam, Nourith, Axelle Red have accepted to sing it.
In 2003, Gabriel contributed a song for the video game Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. In 2004, Gabriel contributed another song (""Curtains"") and contributed voice work on another game in the Myst franchise, Myst IV: Revelation.
In June 2005, Gabriel and broadcast industry entrepreneur David Engelke purchased Solid State Logic, a manufacturer of mixing consoles and digital audio workstations. In 2017, the company was sold to the Audiotonix Group.
In May 2008, Gabriel's Real World Studios, in partnership with Bowers & Wilkins, started the Bowers & Wilkins Music Club—later known as Society of Sound—a subscription-based music retail site. Albums are currently available in either Apple Lossless or FLAC format.
He is one of the founding supporters of the annual global event Asteroid Day.

Activist for humanitarian causes
In 1986, he started what has become a longstanding association with Amnesty International, becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty's Human rights concerts—a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998. He performed during the six-concert A Conspiracy of Hope US tour in June 1986; the twenty-concert Human Rights Now! world tour in 1988; the Chile: Embrace of Hope Concert in 1990 and at The Paris Concert for Amnesty International in 1998. He also performed in Amnesty's Secret Policeman's Ball benefit shows in collaboration with other artists and friends such as Lou Reed, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Youssou N'Dour; Gabriel closed those concerts performing his anti-apartheid anthem ""Biko"".
He spoke of his support for Amnesty on NBC's Today Show in 1986.
Inspired by the social activism he encountered in his work with Amnesty, in 1992, Gabriel co-founded WITNESS, a non-profit organisation that equips, trains and supports locally based organisations worldwide to use video and the internet in human rights documentation and advocacy.
In 1995, Gabriel and Cape Verdean human rights activist Vera Duarte were awarded the North–South Prize in its inaugural year.

In the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur Richard Branson discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts.
On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Kofi Annan served as Chair of the Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as deputy chair. The other members of the group are Martti Ahtisaari, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Graça Machel, Mary Robinson and Ernesto Zedillo. Desmond Tutu was an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.
The Elders use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach.
In November 2007, Gabriel's non-profit group WITNESS launched The Hub, a participatory media site for human rights.
In September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International's 2008 Ambassador of Conscience Award. In the same month, he received Quadriga United We Care award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling and Wikipedia. The award was presented to him by Queen Silvia of Sweden.
In 2010, Gabriel lent his support to the campaign to release Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian Azeri woman who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery.
In December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Gabriel was quoted:

To come out of 27 years in jail and to immediately set about building a Rainbow Nation with your sworn enemy is a unique and extraordinary example of courage and forgiveness. In this case, Mandela had seen many of his people beaten, imprisoned and murdered, yet he was still willing to trust the humanity and idealism of those who had been the oppressors, without whom he knew he could not achieve an almost peaceful transition of power. There is no other example of such inspirational leadership in my lifetime.
Gabriel has criticised Air France for their continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. In a letter to the airline, Gabriel wrote that in laboratories, ""primates are violently force-fed chemicals, inflicted with brain damage, crippled, addicted to cocaine or alcohol, deprived of food and water, or psychologically tormented and ultimately killed.""
In March 2014, Gabriel publicly supported #withsyria, a campaign to rally support for victims of the Syrian Civil War.
In November 2014, Gabriel, along with Pussy Riot and Iron & Wine supported Hong Kong protesters at Hong Kong's Lennon Wall in their efforts.
In March 2015, Gabriel was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of South Australia in recognition of his commitment to creativity and its transformational power in building peace and understanding.
He composed the song ""The Veil"" for Oliver Stone's film Snowden (2016).

Political views
Gabriel has been described as one of rock's most political musicians by AllMusic. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday tragedy, Gabriel joined several left-wing figures such as Peter Hain, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Benn, Ken Loach, John Pilger and Adrian Mitchell in voicing his support for a demonstration in London calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
At the 1997 general election, he declared his support for the Labour Party, which won that election by a landslide after 18 years out of power, led by Tony Blair. In 1998, he was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to Labour. He subsequently distanced himself from the Labour government following Tony Blair's support for George W. Bush and Britain's involvement in the Iraq War, which he strongly opposed. Gabriel later explained his decision for funding Labour, saying, ""after all those years of Thatcher, that was the only time I've put money into a political party because I wanted to help get rid of the Tory government of that time.""
In 2005, Gabriel gave a Green Party of England and Wales general election candidate special permission to record a cover of his song ""Don't Give Up"" for his campaign. In 2010, The Guardian described Gabriel as ""a staunch advocate of proportional representation."" In 2013, he stated that he had become more interested in online petitioning organisations to effect change than traditional party politics.
In 2012, Gabriel condemned the use of his music by the American conservative talk radio personality Rush Limbaugh during a controversial segment in which Limbaugh vilified Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke. A statement on behalf of Gabriel read: ""Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh's extraordinary attack on Sandra Fluke. It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter's work that he would never approve such a use. He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair, aggressive and ignorant comments.""
In 2016, Gabriel supported the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the referendum on the issue.
Gabriel has declared his support for the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2014, he contributed songs to a new compilation album to raise funds for humanitarian organisations aiding Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. Gabriel was quoted: ""I am certain that Israelis and Palestinians will both benefit from a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. We have watched Palestinians suffer for too long, especially in Gaza. I am not, and never was, anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic, but I oppose the policy of the Israeli government, oppose injustice and oppose the occupation ... I am proud to be one of the voices asking the Israeli government: 'Where is the two-state solution that you wanted so much?' and clearly say that enough is enough."" In 2019, Gabriel was among 50 artists who urged the BBC to ask for the Eurovision Song Contest to be moved out of Israel, citing human rights concerns. In 2023, Gabriel signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.
Gabriel has been in support of the Armenian genocide recognition. In October 2020, he posted a message on social media in support of Armenia and Artsakh in regards to the Nagorno-Karabakh war. He said, ""The fighting that has now broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia is really horrific and we need to lobby whoever we can to encourage a ceasefire, but hearing reports that President Erdoğan has now lined up 80,000 Turkish troops on the Armenian border is a terrifying prospect, full of the dark echoes of history.""

In popular culture
Gabriel's music featured prominently on the popular 1980s television show Miami Vice. The songs include ""The Rhythm of the Heat"" and ""Biko"" (from ""Evan""), ""Red Rain"" (from ""Stone's War""), ""Mercy Street"" (from ""Killshot""), ""Sledgehammer"" (from ""Better Living Through Chemistry""), ""We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)"" (from ""Forgive Us Our Debts"" and ""Deliver Us from Evil"") and ""Don't Give Up"" (from ""Redemption in Blood""). With seven songs used total, Gabriel had the most music featured by a solo artist in the series, and he is the only artist to have had a song used in four of Vice's five seasons. Five of the nine tracks on his most popular album So (1986) were used in the series.
Gabriel's cover of David Bowie's ""Heroes"" was featured in the fourth season finale of Big Love, as well as the first season and the ending scene of Stranger Things season 3 and the ending credits of Lone Survivor. The song also features in 'Children of Mars', a 2020 episode of the web series Star Trek: Short Treks.
A series of spoof documentaries about the fictitious rock star Brian Pern were based loosely on Gabriel.
In 2021, Northern Irish post-punk band Invaderband released their second studio album entitled 'Peter Gabriel'. The sleeve was a painting of Gabriel by Luke Haines.

Personal life
Gabriel has married twice and has four children. In 1971, at age 21, he married Jill Moore, daughter of Baron Philip Moore. They had two daughters, one of whom, Anna-Marie, is a filmmaker who filmed and directed Gabriel's live DVDs Growing Up on Tour: A Family Portrait (2003), Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2005) and some of his music videos. Melanie is a musician who had been a backing vocalist in her father's band in 2002–2011. Both daughters appear in the final sequence of the video for their father's song ""Sledgehammer"".
Gabriel's marriage became increasingly strained, culminating in Moore's affair with David Lord, the co-producer of Gabriel's fourth studio album. After the couple divorced in 1987, Gabriel fell into a period of depression and attended therapy sessions for six years.
For a time after his divorce, Gabriel lived with American actress Rosanna Arquette. In 2021, Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor said that she maintained an on-and-off relationship with Gabriel in the wake of his divorce. She ended the relationship because of her frustration with his lack of commitment, which inspired her single ""Thank You for Hearing Me"".
Gabriel married Meabh Flynn in 2002, with whom he has two sons.
Gabriel has resided in Wiltshire for many years and runs Real World Studios from Box, Wiltshire. He previously lived in the Woolley Valley near Bath, Somerset. In 2010, he joined a campaign to stop agricultural development in the valley, which had also inspired his first solo single, ""Solsbury Hill"", in 1977.

Peter Gabriel on the Music-Map"
Philip Glass,"Philip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer and pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century.  Glass's work has been associated with minimalism, being built up from repetitive phrases and shifting layers. Glass describes himself as a composer of ""music with repetitive structures"", which he has helped to evolve stylistically.
Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, which is still in existence, but Glass no longer performs with the ensemble. He has written 15 operas, numerous chamber operas and musical theatre works, 14 symphonies, 12 concertos, nine string quartets, various other chamber music pieces, and many film scores. Three of his film scores have been nominated for Academy Awards.

Early life and education
Glass was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on January 31, 1937, the son of Ida (née Gouline) and Benjamin Charles Glass. His family were Latvian and Russian-Jewish emigrants. His father owned a record store and his mother was a librarian. In his memoir, Glass recalls that at the end of World War II his mother aided Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find a job and a place to live.: 14  She developed a plan to help them learn English and develop skills so they could find work.: 15  His sister, Sheppie, would later do similar work as an active member of the International Rescue Committee.: 15 

Glass developed his appreciation of music from his father, discovering later his father's side of the family had many musicians. His cousin Cevia was a classical pianist, while others had been in vaudeville. He learned his family was also related to Al Jolson.: 16  Glass's father often received promotional copies of new recordings at his music store. Glass spent many hours listening to them, developing his knowledge and taste in music. This openness to modern sounds affected Glass at an early age:My father was self-taught, but he ended up having a very refined and rich knowledge of classical, chamber, and contemporary music. Typically he would come home and have dinner, and then sit in his armchair and listen to music until almost midnight. I caught on to this very early, and I would go and listen with him.: 17 
The elder Glass promoted both new recordings and a wide selection of composers to his customers, sometimes convincing them to try something new by allowing them to return records they did not like.: 17  His store soon developed a reputation as Baltimore's leading source of modern music. Glass built a sizable record collection from the unsold records in his father's store, including modern classical music such as Hindemith, Bartók, Schoenberg, Shostakovich and Western classical music including Beethoven's string quartets and Schubert's B♭ Piano Trio. Glass cites Schubert's work as a ""big influence"" growing up. In a 2011 interview, Glass stated that Franz Schubert—with whom he shares a birthday—is his favorite composer.
He studied the flute as a child at the Peabody Preparatory of the Peabody Institute of Music. At the age of 15, he entered an accelerated college program at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and philosophy. In Chicago, he discovered the serialism of Anton Webern and composed a twelve-tone string trio. In 1954, Glass traveled to Paris, where he encountered the films of Jean Cocteau, which made a lasting impression on him. He visited artists' studios and saw their work; Glass recalls, ""the bohemian life you see in [Cocteau's] Orphée was the life I ... was attracted to, and those were the people I hung out with.""
Glass studied at the Juilliard School of Music where the keyboard was his main instrument. His composition teachers included Vincent Persichetti and William Bergsma. Fellow students included Steve Reich and Peter Schickele. In 1959, he was a winner in the BMI Foundation's BMI Student Composer Awards, an international prize for young composers. In the summer of 1960, he studied with Darius Milhaud at the summer school of the Aspen Music Festival and composed a violin concerto for a fellow student, Dorothy Pixley-Rothschild. After leaving Juilliard in 1962, Glass moved to Pittsburgh and worked as a school-based composer-in-residence in the public school system, composing various choral, chamber, and orchestral music.

Career
1964–1966: Paris
In 1964, Glass received a Fulbright Scholarship; his studies in Paris with the eminent composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, from autumn of 1964 to summer of 1966, influenced his work throughout his life, as the composer admitted in 1979: ""The composers I studied with Boulanger are the people I still think about most—Bach and Mozart.""
Glass later wrote in his autobiography Music by Philip Glass in 1987 that the new music performed at Pierre Boulez's Domaine Musical concerts in Paris lacked any excitement for him (with the notable exceptions of music by John Cage and Morton Feldman), but he was deeply impressed by new films and theatre performances. His move away from modernist composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen was nuanced, rather than outright rejection: ""That generation wanted disciples and as we didn't join up it was taken to mean that we hated the music, which wasn't true. We'd studied them at Juilliard and knew their music. How on earth can you reject Berio? Those early works of Stockhausen are still beautiful. But there was just no point in attempting to do their music better than they did and so we started somewhere else.""
During this time, he encountered revolutionary films of the French New Wave, such as those of Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, which upended the rules set by an older generation of artists, and Glass made friends with American visual artists (the sculptor Richard Serra and his wife Nancy Graves), actors and directors (JoAnne Akalaitis, Ruth Maleczech, David Warrilow, and Lee Breuer, with whom Glass later founded the experimental theatre group Mabou Mines). Together with Akalaitis (they married in 1965), Glass in turn attended performances by theatre groups including Jean-Louis Barrault's Odéon theatre, The Living Theatre and the Berliner Ensemble in 1964 to 1965. These significant encounters resulted in a collaboration with Breuer for which Glass contributed music for a 1965 staging of Samuel Beckett's Comédie (Play, 1963). The resulting piece (written for two soprano saxophones) was directly influenced by the play's open-ended, repetitive and almost musical structure and was the first one of a series of four early pieces in a minimalist, yet still dissonant, idiom. After Play, Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, featuring the theatre score by Paul Dessau.
In parallel with his early excursions in experimental theatre, Glass worked in winter 1965 and spring 1966 as a music director and composer on a film score (Chappaqua, Conrad Rooks, 1966) with Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha, which added another important influence on Glass's musical thinking. His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive. He renounced all his compositions in a moderately modern style resembling Milhaud's, Aaron Copland's, and Samuel Barber's, and began writing pieces based on repetitive structures of Indian music and a sense of time influenced by Samuel Beckett: a piece for two actresses and chamber ensemble, a work for chamber ensemble and his first numbered string quartet (No. 1, 1966).
Glass then left Paris for northern India in 1966, where he came in contact with Tibetan refugees and began to gravitate towards Buddhism. He met Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in 1972, and has been a strong supporter of the Tibetan independence ever since.

1967–1974: Minimalism: From Strung Out to Music in 12 Parts
Shortly after arriving in New York City in March 1967, Glass attended a performance of works by Steve Reich (including the ground-breaking minimalist piece Piano Phase), which left a deep impression on him; he simplified his style and turned to a radical ""consonant vocabulary"". Finding little sympathy from traditional performers and performance spaces, Glass eventually formed an ensemble with fellow ex-student Jon Gibson, and others, and began performing mainly in art galleries and studio lofts of SoHo. The visual artist Richard Serra provided Glass with Gallery contacts, while both collaborated on various sculptures, films and installations; from 1971 to 1974, he was Serra's regular studio assistant.
Between summer of 1967 and the end of 1968, Glass composed nine works, including Strung Out (for amplified solo violin, composed in summer of 1967), Gradus (for solo saxophone, 1968), Music in the Shape of a Square (for two flutes, composed in May 1968, an homage to Erik Satie), How Now (for solo piano, 1968) and 1+1 (for amplified tabletop, November 1968) which were ""clearly designed to experiment more fully with his new-found minimalist approach"". The first concert of Glass's new music was at Jonas Mekas's Film-Makers Cinemathèque (Anthology Film Archives) in September 1968. This concert included the first work of this series with Strung Out (performed by the violinist Pixley-Rothschild) and Music in the Shape of a Square (performed by Glass and Gibson). The musical scores were tacked on the wall, and the performers had to move while playing. Glass's new works met with a very enthusiastic response by the audience which consisted mainly of visual and performance artists who were highly sympathetic to Glass's reductive approach.
Apart from his music career, Glass had a moving company with his cousin, the sculptor Jene Highstein, and also worked as a plumber and cab driver (during 1973 to 1978). He recounts installing a dishwasher and looking up from his work to see an astonished Robert Hughes, Time magazine's art critic, staring at him. During this time, he made friends with other New York-based artists such as Sol LeWitt, Nancy Graves, Michael Snow, Bruce Nauman, Laurie Anderson, and Chuck Close (who created a now-famous portrait of Glass). (Glass returned the compliment in 2005 with A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close for piano.)
With 1+1 and Two Pages (composed in February 1969), Glass turned to a more ""rigorous approach"" to his ""most basic minimalist technique, additive process"", pieces which were followed in the same year by Music in Contrary Motion and Music in Fifths (a kind of homage to his composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, who pointed out ""hidden fifths"" in his works but regarded them as cardinal sins). Eventually Glass's music grew less austere, becoming more complex and dramatic, with pieces such as Music in Similar Motion (1969), and Music with Changing Parts (1970). These pieces were performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble in the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1969 and in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1970, often encountering hostile reaction from critics, but Glass's music was also met with enthusiasm from younger artists such as Brian Eno and David Bowie (at the Royal College of Art ca. 1970). Eno described this encounter with Glass's music as one of the ""most extraordinary musical experiences of [his] life"", as a ""viscous bath of pure, thick energy"", concluding ""this was actually the most detailed music I'd ever heard. It was all intricacy, exotic harmonics"". In 1970, Glass returned to the theatre, composing music for the theatre group Mabou Mines, resulting in his first minimalist pieces employing voices: Red Horse Animation and Music for Voices (both 1970, and premiered at the Paula Cooper Gallery).
After differences of opinion with Steve Reich in 1971, Glass formed the Philip Glass Ensemble (while Reich formed Steve Reich and Musicians), an amplified ensemble including keyboards, wind instruments (saxophones, flutes), and soprano voices.
Glass's music for his ensemble culminated in the four-hour-long Music in Twelve Parts (1971–1974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass's musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it—the last part features a twelve-tone theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. ""I had broken the rules of modernism and so I thought it was time to break some of my own rules"", according to Glass. Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces up to and including Music in 12 Parts, excepting this last part which ""was the end of minimalism"" for Glass. As he pointed out: ""I had worked for eight or nine years inventing a system, and now I'd written through it and come out the other end."" He now prefers to describe himself as a composer of ""music with repetitive structures"".

1975–1979: Another Look at Harmony: The Portrait Trilogy
Glass continued his work with a series of instrumental works, called Another Look at Harmony (1975–1977). For Glass, this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: ""What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. ... I'd taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide just what I wanted to put in—a process that would occupy me for several years to come.""
Parts 1 and 2 of Another Look at Harmony were included in a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: Einstein on the Beach. Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass's first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the Festival d'Avignon, and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by Christopher Knowles, Lucinda Childs and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass's and Wilson's essentially plotless opera was conceived as a ""metaphorical look at Albert Einstein: scientist, humanist, amateur musician—and the man whose theories ... led to the splitting of the atom"", evoking nuclear holocaust in the climactic scene, as critic Tim Page pointed out. As with Another Look at Harmony, ""Einstein added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works"". Composer Tom Johnson came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to Johann Sebastian Bach, and the ""organ figures ... to those Alberti basses Mozart loved so much"". The piece was praised by The Washington Post as ""one of the seminal artworks of the century"".
Einstein on the Beach was followed by further music for projects by the theatre group Mabou Mines such as Dressed like an Egg (1975), and again music for plays and adaptations from prose by Samuel Beckett, such as The Lost Ones (1975), Cascando (1975), Mercier and Camier (1979). Glass also turned to other media; two multi-movement instrumental works for the Philip Glass Ensemble originated as music for film and TV: North Star (1977 score for the documentary North Star: Mark di Suvero by François de Menil and Barbara Rose) and four short cues for the children's TV series Sesame Street named Geometry of Circles (1979).
Another series, Fourth Series (1977–79), included music for chorus and organ (""Part One"", 1977), organ and piano (""Part Two"" and ""Part Four"", 1979), and music for a radio adaption of Constance DeJong's novel Modern Love (""Part Three"", 1978). ""Part Two"" and ""Part Four"" were used (and hence renamed) in two dance productions by choreographer Lucinda Childs (who had already contributed to and performed in Einstein on the Beach). ""Part Two"" was included in Dance (a collaboration with visual artist Sol LeWitt, 1979), and ""Part Four"" was renamed as Mad Rush, and performed by Glass on several occasions such as the first public appearance of the 14th Dalai Lama in New York City in fall 1981. The piece demonstrates Glass's turn to more traditional models: the composer added a conclusion to an open-structured piece which ""can be interpreted as a sign that he [had] abandoned the radical non-narrative, undramatic approaches of his early period"", as the pianist Steffen Schleiermacher points out.
In spring 1978, Glass received a commission from the Netherlands Opera (as well as a Rockefeller Foundation grant) which ""marked the end of his need to earn money from non-musical employment"". With the commission Glass continued his work in music theater, composing his opera Satyagraha (composed in 1978–1979, premiered in 1980 at Rotterdam), based on the early life of Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, and Martin Luther King Jr. For Satyagraha, Glass worked in close collaboration with two ""SoHo friends"": the writer Constance deJong, who provided the libretto, and the set designer Robert Israel. This piece was in other ways a turning point for Glass, as it was his first work since 1963 scored for symphony orchestra, even if the most prominent parts were still reserved for solo voices and chorus. Shortly after completing the score in August 1979, Glass met the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, whom he helped prepare for performances in Germany (using a piano-four-hands version of the score); together they started to plan another opera, to be premiered at the Stuttgart State Opera.

1980–1986: Completing the Portrait Trilogy: Akhnaten and beyond
While planning a third part of his ""Portrait Trilogy"", Glass turned to smaller music theatre projects such as the non-narrative Madrigal Opera (for six voices and violin and viola, 1980), and The Photographer, a biographic study on the photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1982). Glass also continued to write for the orchestra with the score of Koyaanisqatsi (Godfrey Reggio, 1981–1982). Some pieces which were not used in the film (such as Façades) eventually appeared on the album Glassworks (1982, CBS Records), which brought Glass's music to a wider public.
The ""Portrait Trilogy"" was completed with Akhnaten (1982–1983, premiered in 1984), a vocal and orchestral composition sung in Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, and Ancient Egyptian. In addition, this opera featured an actor reciting ancient Egyptian texts in the language of the audience. Akhnaten was commissioned by the Stuttgart Opera in a production designed by Achim Freyer. It premiered simultaneously at the Houston Opera in a production directed by David Freeman and designed by Peter Sellars. At the time of the commission, the Stuttgart Opera House was undergoing renovation, necessitating the use of a nearby playhouse with a smaller orchestra pit. Upon learning this, Glass and conductor Dennis Russell Davies visited the playhouse, placing music stands around the pit to determine how many players the pit could accommodate. The two found they could not fit a full orchestra in the pit. Glass decided to eliminate the violins, which had the effect of ""giving the orchestra a low, dark sound that came to characterize the piece and suited the subject very well"". As Glass remarked in 1992, Akhnaten is significant in his work since it represents a ""first extension out of a triadic harmonic language"", an experiment with the polytonality of his teachers Persichetti and Milhaud, a musical technique which Glass compares to ""an optical illusion, such as in the paintings of Josef Albers"".
Glass again collaborated with Robert Wilson on another opera, the CIVIL warS (1983, premiered in 1984), which also functioned as the final part (the Rome section) of Wilson's epic work by the same name, originally planned for an ""international arts festival that would accompany the Olympic Games in Los Angeles"". (Glass also composed a prestigious work for chorus and orchestra for the opening of the Games, The Olympian: Lighting of the Torch and Closing ). The premiere of The CIVIL warS in Los Angeles never materialized and the opera was in the end premiered at the Opera of Rome. Glass's and Wilson's opera includes musical settings of Latin texts by the 1st-century-Roman playwright Seneca and allusions to the music of Giuseppe Verdi and from the American Civil War, featuring the 19th century figures Giuseppe Garibaldi and Robert E. Lee as characters.
In the mid-1980s, Glass produced ""works in different media at an extraordinarily rapid pace"". Projects from that period include music for dance (Glass Pieces choreographed for New York City Ballet by Jerome Robbins in 1983 to a score drawn from existing Glass compositions created for other media including an excerpt from Akhnaten; and In the Upper Room, Twyla Tharp, 1986), music for theatre productions Endgame (1984) and Company (1983). Beckett vehemently disapproved of the production of Endgame at the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which featured JoAnne Akalaitis's direction and Glass's Prelude for timpani and double bass, but in the end, he authorized the music for Company, four short, intimate pieces for string quartet that were played in the intervals of the dramatization. This composition was initially regarded by the composer as a piece of Gebrauchsmusik ('music for use')—""like salt and pepper ... just something for the table"", as he noted. Eventually Company was published as Glass's String Quartet No. 2 and in a version for string orchestra, being performed by ensembles ranging from student orchestras to renowned formations such as the Kronos Quartet and the Kremerata Baltica.
This interest in writing for the string quartet and the string orchestra led to a chamber and orchestral film score for Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (Paul Schrader, 1984–85), which Glass recently described as his ""musical turning point"" that developed his ""technique of film scoring in a very special way"".
Glass also dedicated himself to vocal works with two sets of songs, Three Songs for chorus (1984, settings of poems by Leonard Cohen, Octavio Paz and Raymond Lévesque), and a song cycle initiated by CBS Masterworks Records: Songs from Liquid Days (1985), with texts by songwriters such as David Byrne, Paul Simon, in which the Kronos Quartet is featured (as it is in Mishima) in a prominent role. Glass also continued his series of operas with adaptations from literary texts such as The Juniper Tree (an opera collaboration with composer Robert Moran, 1984), Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher (1987), and also worked with novelist Doris Lessing on the opera The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (1985–86, and performed by the Houston Grand Opera and English National Opera in 1988).

1987–1991: Operas and the turn to symphonic music
Compositions such as Company, Facades and String Quartet No. 3 (the last two extracted from the scores to Koyaanisqatsi and Mishima) gave way to a series of works more accessible to ensembles such as the string quartet and symphony orchestra, in this returning to the structural roots of his student days. In taking this direction his chamber and orchestral works were also written in a more and more traditional and lyrical style. In these works, Glass often employs old musical forms such as the chaconne and the passacaglia—for instance in Satyagraha, the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987), Symphony No. 3 (1995), Echorus (1995) and also recent works such as Symphony No. 8 (2005), and Songs and Poems for Solo Cello (2006).
A series of orchestral works originally composed for the concert hall commenced with the three-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto is dedicated to the memory of Glass's father: ""His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. ... So when I decided to write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one that my father would have liked."" Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic. This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of ""portraits of nature"", commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: The Light (1987), The Canyon (1988), and Itaipu (1989).
While composing for symphonic ensembles, Glass also composed music for piano, with the cycle of five movements titled Metamorphosis (adapted from music for a theatrical adaptation of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis), and for the Errol Morris film The Thin Blue Line, 1988. In the same year Glass met the poet Allen Ginsberg by chance in a book store in the East Village of New York City, and they immediately ""decided on the spot to do something together, reached for one of Allen's books and chose Wichita Vortex Sutra"", a piece for reciter and piano which in turn developed into a music theatre piece for singers and ensemble, Hydrogen Jukebox (1990).
Glass also returned to chamber music; he composed two String Quartets (No. 4 Buczak in 1989 and No. 5 in 1991), and chamber works which originated as incidental music for plays, such as Music from ""The Screens"" (1989/1990). This work originated in one of many theater music collaborations with the director JoAnne Akalaitis, who originally asked the Gambian musician Foday Musa Suso ""to do the score [for Jean Genet's The Screens] in collaboration with a western composer"". Glass had already collaborated with Suso in the film score to Powaqqatsi (Godfrey Reggio, 1988). Music from ""The Screens"" is on occasion a touring piece for Glass and Suso (one set of tours also included percussionist Yousif Sheronick ), and individual pieces found their way into the repertoire of Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter. Another collaboration was a collaborative recording project with Ravi Shankar, initiated by Peter Baumann (a member of the band Tangerine Dream), which resulted in the album Passages (1990).
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Glass's projects also included two highly prestigious opera commissions based on the life of explorers: The Voyage (1992), with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus; and White Raven (1991), about Vasco da Gama, a collaboration with Robert Wilson and composed for the closure of the 1998 World Fair in Lisbon. Especially in The Voyage, the composer ""explore[d] new territory"", with its ""newly arching lyricism"", ""Sibelian starkness and sweep"", and ""dark, brooding tone ... a reflection of its increasingly chromatic (and dissonant) palette"", as one commentator put it.
Glass remixed the S'Express song ""Hey Music Lover"", for the b-side of its 1989 release as a single.

1991–1996: Cocteau trilogy and symphonies
After these operas, Glass began working on a symphonic cycle, commissioned by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: ""I'm not going to let you ... be one of those opera composers who never write a symphony"". Glass responded with a pair of three-movement symphonies (""Low"" [1992], and Symphony No. 2 [1994]); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album Low (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in polytonality. He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russell Davies), and Echorus (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's ""most tautly unified works"". The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled Heroes (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album ""Heroes"", 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.
Another commission by Dennis Russell Davies was a second series for piano, the Etudes for Piano (dedicated to Davies as well as the production designer Achim Freyer); the complete first set of ten Etudes has been recorded and performed by Glass himself. Bruce Brubaker and Dennis Russell Davies have each recorded the original set of six. Most of the Etudes are composed in the post-minimalist and increasingly lyrical style of the times: ""Within the framework of a concise form, Glass explores possible sonorities ranging from typically Baroque passagework to Romantically tinged moods"". Some of the pieces also appeared in different versions such as in the theatre music to Robert Wilson's Persephone (1994, commissioned by the Relache Ensemble) or Echorus (a version of Etude No. 2 for two violins and string orchestra, written for Edna Mitchell and Yehudi Menuhin 1995).
Glass's prolific output in the 1990s continued to include operas with an opera triptych (1991–1996), which the composer described as an ""homage"" to writer and film director Jean Cocteau, based on his prose and cinematic work: Orphée (1950), La Belle et la Bête (1946), and the novel Les Enfants terribles (1929, later made into a film by Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville, 1950). In the same way the triptych is also a musical homage to the work of the group of French composers associated with Cocteau, Les Six (and especially to Glass's teacher Darius Milhaud), as well as to various 18th-century composers such as Gluck and Bach whose music featured as an essential part of the films by Cocteau.
The inspiration of the first part of the trilogy, Orphée (composed in 1991, and premiered in 1993 at the American Repertory Theatre) can be conceptually and musically traced to Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice (Orphée et Euridyce, 1762/1774), which had a prominent part in Cocteau's 1949 film Orphee. One theme of the opera, the death of Eurydice, has some similarity to the composer's personal life: the opera was composed after the unexpected death in 1991 of Glass's wife, artist Candy Jernigan: ""... One can only suspect that Orpheus' grief must have resembled the composer's own"", K. Robert Schwartz suggests. The opera's ""transparency of texture, a subtlety of instrumental color, ... a newly expressive and unfettered vocal writing"" was praised, and The Guardian's critic remarked ""Glass has a real affinity for the French text and sets the words eloquently, underpinning them with delicately patterned instrumental textures"".
For the second opera, La Belle et la Bête (1994, scored for either the Philip Glass Ensemble or a more conventional chamber orchestra), Glass replaced the soundtrack (including Georges Auric's film music) of Cocteau's film, wrote ""a new fully operatic score and synchronize[d] it with the film"". The final part of the triptych returned again to a more traditional setting with the ""Dance Opera"" Les Enfants terribles (1996), scored for voices, three pianos and dancers, with choreography by Susan Marshall. The characters are depicted by both singers and dancers. The scoring of the opera evokes Bach's Concerto for Four Harpsichords, but in another way also ""the snow, which falls relentlessly throughout the opera ... bearing witness to the unfolding events. Here time stands still. There is only music, and the movement of children through space"" (Glass).

1997–2004: Symphonies, opera, and concertos
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Glass's lyrical and romantic styles peaked with a variety of projects: operas, theatre and film scores (Martin Scorsese's Kundun, 1997, Godfrey Reggio's Naqoyqatsi, 2002, and Stephen Daldry's The Hours, 2002), a series of five concerts, and three symphonies centered on orchestra-singer and orchestra-chorus interplay. Two symphonies, Symphony No. 5 ""Choral"" (1999) and Symphony No. 7 ""Toltec"" (2004), and the song cycle Songs of Milarepa (1997) have a meditative theme. The operatic Symphony No. 6 Plutonian Ode (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and Carnegie Hall in celebration of Glass's sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass's collaboration with Allen Ginsberg (poet, piano—Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.
Besides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5 ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), In the Penal Colony (2000, after the story by Franz Kafka), and the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the Pipa, performed by Wu Man at its premiere. Glass also collaborated again with the co-author of Einstein on the Beach, Robert Wilson, on Monsters of Grace (1998), and created a biographic opera on the life of astronomer Galileo Galilei (2001).
In the early 2000s, Glass started a series of five concerti with the Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (2000, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies as conductor and soloist), and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000, for the timpanist Jonathan Haas). The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (2001) had its premiere performance in Beijing, featuring cellist Julian Lloyd Webber; it was composed in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. These concertos were followed by the concise and rigorously neo-Baroque Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra (2002), demonstrating in its transparent, chamber orchestral textures Glass's classical technique, evocative in the ""improvisatory chords"" of its beginning a toccata of Froberger or Frescobaldi, and 18th century music. Two years later, the concerti series continued with Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark (2004), composed for the pianist Paul Barnes. The concerto celebrates the pioneers' trek across North America, and the second movement features a duet for piano and Native American flute. With the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice, Glass's Piano Concerto No. 2 might be regarded as bridging his traditional compositions and his more popular excursions to World Music, also found in Orion (also composed in 2004).

2005–2007: Songs and Poems
Waiting for the Barbarians, an opera from J. M. Coetzee's novel (with the libretto by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined the work as a ""social/political opera"", as a critique on the Bush administration's war in Iraq, a ""dialogue about political crisis"", and an illustration of the ""power of art to turn our attention toward the human dimension of history"". While the opera's themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using ""very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it's almost classical in sound"", as the conductor Dennis Russell Davies notes.
Two months after the premiere of this opera, in November 2005, Glass's Symphony No. 8, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, was premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. After three symphonies for voices and orchestra, this piece was a return to purely orchestral and abstract composition; like previous works written for the conductor Dennis Russell Davies (the 1992 Concerto Grosso and the 1995 Symphony No. 3), it features extended solo writing. Critic Allan Kozinn described the symphony's chromaticism as more extreme, more fluid, and its themes and textures as continually changing, morphing without repetition, and praised the symphony's ""unpredictable orchestration"", pointing out the ""beautiful flute and harp variation in the melancholy second movement"". Alex Ross, remarked that ""against all odds, this work succeeds in adding something certifiably new to the overstuffed annals of the classical symphony. ... The musical material is cut from familiar fabric, but it's striking that the composer forgoes the expected bustling conclusion and instead delves into a mood of deepening twilight and unending night.""
The Passion of Ramakrishna (2006), was composed for the Pacific Symphony orchestra, the Pacific Chorale and the conductor Carl St. Clair. The 45 minutes choral work is based on the writings of Indian spiritual leader Ramakrishna, which seem ""to have genuinely inspired and revived the composer out of his old formulas to write something fresh"", as one critic remarked, whereas another noted ""The musical style breaks little new ground for Glass, except for the glorious Handelian ending ... the composer's style ideally fits the devotional text"".
A cello suite, composed for the cellist Wendy Sutter, Songs and Poems for Solo Cello (2005–2007), was equally lauded by critics. It was described by Lisa Hirsch as ""a major work, ... a major addition to the cello repertory"" and ""deeply Romantic in spirit, and at the same time deeply Baroque"". Another critic, Anne Midgette of The Washington Post, noted the suite ""maintains an unusual degree of directness and warmth""; she also noted a kinship to a major work by Johann Sebastian Bach: ""Digging into the lower registers of the instrument, it takes flight in handfuls of notes, now gentle, now impassioned, variously evoking the minor-mode keening of klezmer music and the interior meditations of Bach's cello suites"". Glass himself pointed out ""in many ways it owes more to Schubert than to Bach"".
In 2007, Glass also worked alongside Leonard Cohen on an adaptation of Cohen's poetry collection Book of Longing. The work, which premiered in June 2007 in Toronto, is a piece for seven instruments and a vocal quartet, and contains recorded spoken word performances by Cohen and imagery from his collection.
Appomattox, an opera surrounding the events at the end of the American Civil War, was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera and premiered on October 5, 2007. As in Waiting for the Barbarians, Glass collaborated with the writer Christopher Hampton, and as with the preceding opera and Symphony No. 8, the piece was conducted by Glass's long-time collaborator Dennis Russell Davies, who noted ""in his recent operas the bass line has taken on an increasing prominence,... (an) increasing use of melodic elements in the deep register, in the contrabass, the contrabassoon—he's increasingly using these sounds and these textures can be derived from using these instruments in different combinations. ... He's definitely developed more skill as an orchestrator, in his ability to conceive melodies and harmonic structures for specific instrumental groups. ... what he gives them to play is very organic and idiomatic.""
Apart from this large-scale opera, Glass added a work to his catalogue of theater music in 2007, and continuing—after a gap of twenty years—to write music for the dramatic work of Samuel Beckett. He provided a ""hypnotic"" original score for a compilation of Beckett's short plays Act Without Words I, Act Without Words II, Rough for Theatre I and Eh Joe, directed by JoAnne Akalaitis and premiered in December 2007. Glass's work for this production was described by The New York Times as ""icy, repetitive music that comes closest to piercing the heart"".

2008–present: Chamber music, concertos, and symphonies
Between 2008 and 2010, Glass continued to work on a series of chamber music pieces which started with Songs and Poems: the Four Movements for Two Pianos (2008, premiered by Dennis Davies and Maki Namekawa in July 2008), a Sonata for Violin and Piano composed in ""the Brahms tradition"" (completed in 2008, premiered by violinist Maria Bachman and pianist Jon Klibonoff in February 2009); a String sextet (an adaption of the Symphony No. 3 of 1995 made by Glass's musical director Michael Riesman) followed in 2009. Pendulum (2010, a one-movement piece for violin and piano), a second Suite of cello pieces for Wendy Sutter (2011), and Partita for solo violin for violinist Tim Fain (2010, first performance of the complete work 2011), are recent entries in the series.
Other works for the theater were a score for Euripides' The Bacchae (2009, directed by JoAnne Akalaitis), and Kepler (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera is based on the life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as ""oratorio-like""; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's ""most chromatic, complex, psychological score"" and ""the orchestra dominates ... I was struck by the muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments"".
In 2009 and 2010, Glass returned to the concerto genre. Violin Concerto No. 2 in four movements was commissioned by violinist Robert McDuffie, and subtitled ""The American Four Seasons"" (2009), as an homage to Vivaldi's set of concertos The Four Seasons. It premiered in December 2009 by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and was subsequently performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in April 2010. The Double Concerto for Violin and Cello and Orchestra (2010) was composed for soloists Maria Bachmann and Wendy Sutter and also as a ballet score for the Nederlands Dans Theater. Other orchestral projects of 2010 are short orchestral scores for films; to a multimedia presentation based on the novel Icarus at the Edge of Time by theoretical physicist Brian Greene, which premiered on June 6, 2010, and the score for the Brazilian film Nosso Lar (released in Brazil on September 3, 2010). Glass also donated a short work, Brazil, to the video game Chime, which was released on February 3, 2010.
In August 2011, Glass presented a series of music, dance, and theater performances as part of the Days and Nights Festival. Along with the Philip Glass Ensemble, scheduled performers include Molissa Fenley and Dancers, John Moran with Saori Tsukada, as well as a screening of Dracula with Glass's score. 
Other works completed since 2010 include Symphony No. 9 (2010–2011), Symphony No. 10 (2012), Cello Concerto No. 2 (2012, based on the film score to Naqoyqatsi) as well as String Quartet No. 6 and No. 7. Glass's Ninth Symphony was co-commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the American Composers Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. The symphony's first performance took place on January 1, 2012, at the Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra Linz); the American premiere was on January 31, 2012, (Glass's 75th birthday), at Carnegie Hall (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the American Composers Orchestra), and the West Coast premiere with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of John Adams on April 5. Glass's Tenth Symphony, written in five movements, was commissioned by the Orchestre français des jeunes for its 30th anniversary. The symphony's first performance took place on August 9, 2012, at the Grand Théâtre de Provence in Aix-en-Provence under Dennis Russell Davies.
The opera The Perfect American was composed in 2011 to a commission from Teatro Real Madrid. The libretto is based on a book of the same name by Peter Stephan Jungk and covers the final months of the life of Walt Disney. The world premiere was at the Teatro Real, Madrid, on January 22, 2013, with British baritone Christopher Purves taking the role of Disney. The UK premiere took place on June 1, 2013, in a production by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum. The US premiere took place on March 12, 2017, in a production by Long Beach Opera.
His opera The Lost, based on a play by Austrian playwright and novelist Peter Handke, Die Spuren der Verirrten (2007), premiered at the Musiktheater Linz} in April 2013, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies and directed by David Pountney.
On June 28, 2013, Glass's piano piece Two Movements for Four Pianos was premiered at the Museum Kunstpalast, performed by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Maki Namekawa, and Dennis Russell Davies.
On January 17, 2014, Glass's collaboration with Angélique Kidjo Ifé: Three Yorùbá Songs for Orchestra premiered at the Philharmonie Luxembourg.
In May 2015, Glass's Double Concerto for Two Pianos was premiered by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Glass published his memoir, Words Without Music, in 2015. His 11th symphony, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the Istanbul International Music Festival, and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, premiered on January 31, 2017, Glass's 80th birthday, at Carnegie Hall, Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra.  On September 22, 2017, his Piano Concerto No. 3 was premiered by pianist Simone Dinnerstein with the strings of the chamber orchestra A Far Cry at Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts.

The work was commissioned by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and Carnegie Hall. 
Glass's 12th symphony was premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under John Adams at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on January 10, 2019. Commissioned by the orchestra, the work is based on David Bowie's 1979 album Lodger, it completes Glass's trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie's Berlin Trilogy of albums.
In collaboration with stage auteur, performer and co-director (with Kirsty Housley) Phelim McDermott, Glass composed the score for the new work Tao of Glass, which premiered at the 2019 Manchester International Festival before touring to the 2020 Perth Festival.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Glass continued composing, with three major works for opera and symphony premiering in 2021 and 2022. Glass' opera Circus Days and Nights was commissioned by Cirkus Cirkor. The libretto by David Henry Hwang and Tilde Björfors is based on a book of poems by Robert Lax.

Commissioned by the orchestra, the work was written as a tribute to Canadian journalist Peter Jennings.
On November 7, 2023, Glass and Artisan Books released Philip Glass Piano Etudes: The Complete Folios 1–20 & Essays from Fellow Artists a nine-pound deluxe boxed set of Glass' piano etudes and Studies in Time: Essays on the Music of Philip Glass.

Influences and collaborations
Glass describes himself as a ""classicist"", pointing out he is trained in harmony and counterpoint and studied such composers as Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with Nadia Boulanger. Aside from composing in the Western classical tradition, his music has ties to rock, ambient music, electronic music, and world music. Early admirers of his minimalism include musicians Brian Eno and David Bowie. In the 1990s, Glass composed the aforementioned symphonies Low (1992) and Heroes (1996), thematically derived from the Bowie-Eno collaboration albums Low and ""Heroes"" composed in late 1970s Berlin.
Glass has collaborated with recording artists such as Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega, Mick Jagger, Leonard Cohen, David Byrne, Uakti, Natalie Merchant, S'Express (Glass remixed their track Hey Music Lover in 1989) and Aphex Twin (yielding an orchestration of Icct Hedral in 1995 on the Donkey Rhubarb EP). Glass's compositional influence extends to musicians such as Mike Oldfield (who included parts from Glass's North Star in Platinum), and bands such as Tangerine Dream and Talking Heads. Glass and his sound designer Kurt Munkacsi produced the American post-punk/new wave band Polyrock (1978 to the mid-1980s), as well as the recording of John Moran's The Manson Family (An Opera) in 1991, which featured punk legend Iggy Pop, and a second (unreleased) recording of Moran's work featuring poet Allen Ginsberg.
Glass counts many artists among his friends and collaborators, including visual artists (Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Fredericka Foster), writers (Doris Lessing, David Henry Hwang, Allen Ginsberg), film and theatre directors (including Errol Morris, Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis, Godfrey Reggio, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Hampton, Bernard Rose, and many others), choreographers (Lucinda Childs, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp), and musicians and composers (Ravi Shankar, David Byrne, the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, Foday Musa Suso, Laurie Anderson, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Simon, Pierce Turner, Joan La Barbara, Arthur Russell, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Roberto Carnevale, Patti Smith, Aphex Twin, Lisa Bielawa, Andrew Shapiro, John Moran, Bryce Dessner and Nico Muhly). Among recent collaborators are Glass's fellow New Yorker Woody Allen and Stephen Colbert.
Glass had begun using the Farfisa portable organ out of convenience, and he has used it in concert. It is featured on several recordings including North Star and Dance Nos. 1–5.

Music for film
Glass has composed many film scores, starting with the orchestral score for Koyaanisqatsi (1982), and continuing with two biopics, Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985, resulting in the String Quartet No. 3) and Kundun (1997) about the Dalai Lama, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. In 1968 he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle's minimalist comedy short, Railroaded, played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.
The year after scoring Hamburger Hill (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker Errol Morris with his music for Morris's celebrated documentaries, including The Thin Blue Line (1988) and A Brief History of Time (1991).  He continued composing for the Qatsi trilogy with the scores for Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002). In 1995, he composed the theme for Reggio's short independent film Evidence. He made a cameo appearance—briefly visible performing at the piano—in Peter Weir's The Truman Show (1998), which uses music from Powaqqatsi, Anima Mundi and Mishima, as well as three original tracks by Glass. In the 1990s, he also composed scores for Bent (1997) and the supernatural horror film Candyman (1992) and its sequel, Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995), plus a film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (1996).
In 1999, he finished a new soundtrack for the 1931 film Dracula. The Hours (2002) earned him a second Academy Award nomination. The circular, recurring nature of Glass' music has been praised for providing stability and contrast to frequent jumps across time and geography in the film's narrative. In this way, the soundtrack has a distinctive personality, so much so that director Stephen Daldry believes Glass's music serves as ""another stream of consciousness, another character"" in the film. The Hours was followed by another Morris documentary, The Fog of War (2003). In the mid-2000s Glass provided the scores to films such as Secret Window (2004), Neverwas (2005), The Illusionist and Notes on a Scandal, garnering his third Academy Award nomination for the latter. Glass's most recent film scores include No Reservations (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor café), Cassandra's Dream (2007), Les Regrets (2009), Mr Nice (2010), the Brazilian film Nosso Lar (2010) and Fantastic Four (2015, in collaboration with Marco Beltrami). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for Transcendent Man, about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy.
In the 2000s, Glass's work from the 1980s again became known to wider public through various media. In 2005, his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (1987) was featured in the French film The Moustache, providing a tone intentionally incongruous to the banality of the movie's plot. Metamorphosis: Metamorphosis One from Solo Piano (1989) was featured in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica in the episode ""Valley of Darkness"" and also in the final episode (""return 0"") of Person of Interest. In 2008, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto IV featuring Glass's ""Pruit Igoe"" (from Koyaanisqatsi). ""Pruit Igoe"" and ""Prophecies"" (also from Koyaanisqatsi) were used both in a trailer for Watchmen and in the film itself. Watchmen also included two other Glass pieces in the score: ""Something She Has To Do"" from The Hours and ""Protest"" from Satyagraha, act 2, scene 3. In 2013, Glass contributed a piano piece ""Duet"" to the Park Chan-wook film Stoker which is performed diegetically in the film. Glass contributed compositions to the feature documentary ""The General & Me"" by filmmaker Tiana Alexandra-Silliphant, which was showcased at Glass's ""Days and Nights Festival"" in 2017. In 2017, Glass scored the National Geographic Films documentary Jane (a documentary on the life of renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall).
Glass's music was featured in two award-winning films by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, Elena (2011) and Leviathan (2014).
For television, Glass composed the theme for Night Stalker (2005) and the soundtrack for Tales from the Loop (2020). Glass's ""Confrontation and Rescue"" (from Satyagraha) was used in the ending of Season 3 Chapter 6 of Stranger Things (2019), whilst ""Window of Appearances"", ""Akhnaten and Nefertiti"" (from Akhnaten) and ""Prophecies"" (from Koyaanisqatsi) were used in the finale of Season 4 Volume 1 (2022).

Other business ventures
Record labels
In 1970, Glass and Klaus Kertess (owner of the Bykert Gallery) formed a record label named Chatham Square Productions after the location of the studio of a Philip Glass Ensemble member Dick Landry. In 1993, Glass formed another record label, Point Music; in 1997, Point Music released Music for Airports, a live, instrumental version of Eno's composition of the same name, by Bang on a Can All-Stars. In 2002, Glass and his producer Kurt Munkacsi and artist Don Christensen founded the Orange Mountain Music company, dedicated to ""establishing the recording legacy of Philip Glass"" and, to date, have released sixty albums of Glass's music.

Looking Glass Studios
In 1992, Glass built his own recording studio in New York City and named it Looking Glass Studios. In addition to Glass' own recording projects, the studio hosted recording projects of notable artists including Beck, Bjork, Sheryl Crow, The Cure, Grace Jones, Lou Reed, and Roger Waters before its closure in February 2009.

Personal life
Glass lives in New York City and in Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. He has described himself as ""a Jewish-Taoist-Hindu-Toltec-Buddhist"" and is a supporter of the Tibetan independence movement. In 1987, he co-founded the Tibet House US with Columbia University professor Robert Thurman and the actor Richard Gere at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama. Glass is a vegetarian.
Glass has been married four times; he has four children and one granddaughter.

His first marriage was to theater director JoAnne Akalaitis (m. 1965, div. 1980), with whom he has two children: Juliet (b. 1968) and Zachary (b. 1971).
His second marriage was to Luba Burtyk (m. 1980), a physician.
His third wife, the artist Candy Jernigan, died of liver cancer in 1991, aged 39.
Glass's fourth marriage was to restaurant manager, Holly Critchlow (m. in 2001), whom he later divorced. They had two sons, Cameron (b. 2002) and Marlowe (b. 2003).
He was romantically involved with cellist Wendy Sutter for approximately five years.  As of December 2018, his partner was Japanese-born dancer Saori Tsukada.
Glass is the first cousin once removed of Ira Glass, host of the radio show This American Life. Ira interviewed Glass onstage at Chicago's Field Museum; this interview was broadcast on NPR's Fresh Air. Ira interviewed Glass a second time at a fundraiser for St. Ann's Warehouse; this interview was given away to public-radio listeners as a pledge-drive thank-you gift in 2010. Ira and Glass recorded a version of the composition Glass wrote to accompany his friend Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Wichita Vortex Sutra"".  In 2014, This American Life broadcast a live performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that included the world premier of the opera Help, a short monodrama that Philip Glass wrote for the occasion.

Critical reception
Musical Opinion said, ""Philip Glass must be one of the most influential living composers."" The National Endowment for the Arts, while noting that many of his operas have been produced by the world's leading opera houses said, ""He is the first composer to win a wide, multigenerational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film, and in popular music."" Classical Music Review called his opera Akhnaten ""a musically sophisticated and imposing work"".  The New York Metropolitan Opera's production of Akhnaten won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 2022.
Justin Davidson of New York magazine has criticized Glass, saying, ""Glass never had a good idea he didn't flog to death: He repeats the haunting scale 30 mind-numbing times, until it's long past time to go home."" Richard Schickel of Time criticized Glass's score for The Hours, saying, ""This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score—tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.""
Michael White of The Daily Telegraph described Glass's Violin Concerto No. 2 as being

as rewarding as chewing gum that's lost its flavour, and they're not dissimilar activities. This new concerto is unmitigated trash: the usual strung out sequences of arpeggiated banality, driven by the rise and fall of fast-moving but still leaden triplets, and vacuously formulaic. Philip Glass is no Vivaldi, a composer who even at his most wallpaper baroque still has something to say. Glass has nothing—though he presumably deludes himself into thinking he does: hence the preponderance of slow, reflective solo writing in the piece which assumes there's something to reflect on.

Phish,"Phish is an American rock band formed in Burlington, Vermont, in 1983. The band consists of guitarist Trey Anastasio, bassist Mike Gordon, drummer Jon Fishman, and keyboardist Page McConnell, all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the lead vocalist. The band is known for their musical improvisation and jams during their concert performances and for their devoted fan following.
The band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist Jeff Holdsworth, who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the lineup has remained stable since. Most of the band's songs are co-written by Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall. Phish began to perform outside of New England in the late 1980s and experienced a rise in popularity in the mid 1990s. In October 2000, the band began a two-year hiatus that ended in December 2002, but they disbanded again in August 2004. Phish reunited officially in October 2008 for subsequent reunion shows in March 2009 and since then have resumed performing regularly. All four members pursued solo careers or performed with side-projects and these projects have continued even after the band has reunited.
Phish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres including funk, reggae, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, folk, country, jazz, blues, bluegrass, electronic music, and pop. The band is part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the format of the Grateful Dead's live performances and colloquially known as ""jam bands"", that gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s. Phish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.
Phish were signed to major label Elektra Records from 1991 to 2005, when the band formed their own independent label, JEMP Records, to release archival CD and DVD sets.

History
Formation, The White Tape and The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday: 1983–1988
Phish was formed at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists Trey Anastasio and Jeff Holdsworth, bassist Mike Gordon, and drummer Jon Fishman. Anastasio and Fishman had met that October, after Anastasio overheard Fishman playing drums in his dormitory room, and asked if he and Holdsworth could jam with him. Gordon met the trio shortly thereafter, having answered a want-ad for a bass guitarist that Anastasio had posted around the university.
The new group performed their first concert at Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983, where they played a set of classic rock covers, including two songs by the Grateful Dead. The band performed one more concert in 1983, and then did not perform again for nearly a year, stemming from Anastasio's suspension from the university following a prank he had pulled with a friend.
Anastasio returned to his hometown of Princeton, New Jersey following the prank, and reconnected with his childhood friend Tom Marshall; The duo began a songwriting collaboration and recorded material that would appear on the Bivouac Jaun demo tape. Marshall and Anastasio have subsequently composed the majority of Phish's original songs throughout their career. Anastasio returned to Burlington in late 1984, and resumed performing with Gordon, Holdsworth and Fishman. The quartet named themselves Phish in October 1984, shortly before they performed their first concert together following Anastasio's return to UVM. Anastasio designed the band's logo, which featured the group's name inside a stylized fish. The band's members have given several different origins for the name Phish. In Parke Puterbaugh's 2009 book Phish: The Biography, the origin is given as a variation on phshhhh, an onomatopoeia of the sound of a brush on a snare drum. In the 2004 official documentary Specimens of Beauty, Anastasio said the band was also named after Fishman, whose nickname is ""Fish."" In a 1996 interview, Fishman denied that the band was named after him, and said the onomatopoeic inspiration behind the name was the sound of an airplane taking off.
In late 1984, Phish began to play regularly at Nectar's bar and restaurant in downtown Burlington, and performed dozens of concerts across multiple residencies through March 1989. The band's 1992 album A Picture of Nectar was named in honor of the bar's owner, Nectar Rorris, and its cover features his face superimposed onto an orange.
The band would collaborate with percussionist Marc Daubert, a friend of Anastasio's, in the fall of 1984. Daubert ceased performing with the band in early 1985. Keyboardist Page McConnell met Phish in early 1985, when he arranged for them to play a spring concert at Goddard College, the small university he attended in Plainfield, Vermont. He began performing with the band as a guest shortly thereafter, and made his live debut during the third set of their May 3, 1985 concert at UVM's Redstone Campus. In the summer of 1985, Phish went on a short hiatus while Anastasio and Fishman vacationed in Europe; during this time, McConnell offered to join the band permanently, and moved to Burlington to learn their repertoire from Gordon. McConnell officially joined Phish as a full-time band member in September 1985.
Phish performed with a five-piece lineup for about six months after McConnell joined, a period which ended when Holdsworth quit the group in March 1986 following a religious conversion. Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College after a recommendation from McConnell. Phish distributed at least six experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including The White Tape.
While based at Goddard College, Phish began to collaborate with fellow students Richard ""Nancy"" Wright and Jim Pollock. Pollock and Wright were musical collaborators who made experimental recordings on multi-track cassettes, and had been introduced to Phish through McConnell, who co-hosted a radio program on WGDR with Pollock. Phish adopted a number of Nancy's songs into their own set, including ""Halley's Comet"", ""I Didn't Know"", and ""Dear Mrs. Reagan"", the latter song being written by Nancy and Pollock. In his book Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America, music journalist Jesse Jarnow observed that Wright and his music were highly influential to Phish's early style and experimental sound. Wright amicably ended his association with Phish in 1989, but Pollock has continued to collaborate with Phish over the years, designing some of their album covers and concert posters.
By 1985, the group had encountered Burlington luthier Paul Languedoc, who would eventually design custom instruments for Anastasio and Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc has built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity. 
As his senior project for Goddard College, Anastasio penned The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday, a nine-song progressive rock concept album that would become Phish's second studio experiment. Recorded between 1987 and 1988, it was submitted in July of that year, accompanied by a written thesis. The song cycle that developed from the project – known as Gamehendge – grew to include an additional eight songs. The band performed the suite in concert on six occasions: in 1988, 1991, 1993, twice in 1994, and in 2023, without replicating the song list. The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday has never received an official release, but a bootleg tape has circulated for decades, and songs such as ""Wilson"" and ""The Lizards"" remain concert staples for the band.
Beginning in the spring of 1988, members of the band began practicing in earnest, sometimes locking themselves in a room and jamming for hours on end. One such jam took place at Anastasio's apartment, with a second at Paul Languedoc's house in August 1989. They called these jam sessions ""Oh Kee Pa Ceremonies"", a reference to the film A Man Called Horse. In July 1988, the band performed their first concerts outside of the northeastern United States, when they embarked on a seven-date tour in Colorado. These shows are excerpted on their 2006 live compilation Colorado '88.

Junta, Lawn Boy, and A Picture of Nectar: 1989–1992
On January 26, 1989, Phish played the Paradise Rock Club in Boston; the owners of the club had never heard of Phish and refused to book them, so the band rented the club for the night. The show sold out due to the caravan of fans that had traveled to see the band. The concert was Phish's breakthrough on the northeastern regional music circuit, and the band began to book concerts at other large rock clubs, theaters, and small auditoriums throughout the area, such as the Somerville Theatre, Worcester Memorial Auditorium and Wetlands Preserve. That spring, the band self-released their debut full-length studio album, Junta, and sold copies on cassette tape at their concerts. The album includes a studio recording of the epic ""You Enjoy Myself"", which is considered to be the band's signature song. Later in 1989, the band hired Chris Kuroda as their lighting director. Kuroda subsequently became well known for his artistic light shows at the group's concerts. A profile on Phish appeared in the October 1989 issue of the Deadhead magazine Relix, which marked the first time the band had been covered in a major national music periodical.
By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special ""secret language"", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio ""teased"" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, ""D'oh!"" in imitation of . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the ""Big Ball Jam"" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition. On occasion, performances of ""You Enjoy Myself"" and ""Mike's Song"" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers and jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments. Fishman would also regularly step out from behind his drum kit during concerts to sing cover songs, which were often punctuated by him playing an Electrolux vacuum cleaner like an instrument. The band released their second album, Lawn Boy, in September 1990 on Absolute A Go Go, a small independent label that had a distribution deal with the larger Rough Trade Records. The album had been recorded the previous year, after the band had won studio time at engineer Dan Archer's Archer Studios when they came in first place at an April 1989 battle of the bands competition in Burlington.
Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year after they were recommended to the record label by A&R representative Sue Drew. In the summer of 1991, the band embarked on a 14-date tour of the eastern United States accompanied by a three-piece horn section dubbed the Giant Country Horns. In August of that year, Phish played an outdoor concert at their friend Amy Skelton's horse farm in Auburn, Maine that acted as a prototype for their later all-day festival events.
In 1992, the band released their third studio album, A Picture of Nectar, their first release for the major label Elektra. Subsequently, the label also reissued the band's first two albums. Later in 1992, Phish participated in the first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival, which provided them with their first national tour of major amphitheaters. The lineup, among others, included Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. That summer, the band toured Europe with the Violent Femmes and later toured Europe and the U.S. with Santana. Throughout the latter tour, Carlos Santana regularly invited some or all of the members of Phish to jam with his band during their headlining performances. The band ended 1992 with a New Year's Eve performance at the Matthews Arena in Boston, Massachusetts, a performance that was simulcast throughout the Boston area by radio station WBCN. The concert was filled with several new ""secret language"" cues they had taught their audience in order to deliberately confuse radio listeners.

Rift, Hoist, and A Live One: 1993–1995
Phish began headlining major amphitheaters in the summer of 1993. That year, the group released their fourth album, Rift, a concept album which featured a cover painted by David Welker that referenced almost all of the songs on the record. The album was the band's first to appear on the Billboard 200 album chart, debuting at #51 in February 1993.
In March 1994, the band released their fifth studio album Hoist. The album featured an array of guest performers, including country singer Alison Krauss, banjoist Béla Fleck, former Sly & The Family Stone member Rose Stone, actor and trombonist Jonathan Frakes, and the horn section of R&B group Tower of Power. To promote the album, Gordon directed the band's only official music video, for its first single ""Down with Disease"". ""Down with Disease"" became a minor hit on rock radio in the United States, and was the band's first song to appear on a Billboard music chart when it peaked at #33 on the magazine's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart that summer. To further promote Hoist, the band released an experimental short-subject documentary called Tracking, also directed by Gordon, which depicted the recording sessions for the album.
Foreshadowing their future tradition of festivals, Phish coupled camping with their 1994 summer tour finale at Sugarbush North in Warren, Vermont, that show eventually being released as Live Phish Volume 2. On Halloween of that year, the group promised to don a fan-selected ""musical costume"" by playing an entire album from another band. After an extensive mail-based poll, Phish performed the Beatles' White Album as the second of their three sets at the Glens Falls Civic Center in upstate New York. The ""musical costume"" concept subsequently became a recurring part of Phish's fall tours, with the band playing a different album whenever they had a concert scheduled for Halloween night.
In October 1994, Crimes of the Mind, the debut album by Anastasio's friend and collaborator Steve ""The Dude of Life"" Pollak, was released by Elektra Records; The album, which had been recorded in 1991, was billed to ""The Dude of Life and Phish"" and features all four members of Phish acting as Pollak's backing band.

On December 30, 1994, the band made their first appearance on national network television when they performed ""Chalk Dust Torture"" on Late Night with David Letterman. The band would go on to appear on the program seven more times before David Letterman's retirement as host in 2015. For their 1994 New Years Run, Phish played the Civic Centers in Philadelphia and Providence as well as sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden, which marked their debut performances at both venues. For the December 31 show at the Boston Garden, the band rode around the arena in a float shaped like a hot dog. The stunt was reprised at their 1999 New Year's Eve concert before the hot dog was donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the end of 1994, Phish appeared on Pollstar's list of the highest grossing concert tours in the United States for the first time, as the 32nd highest grossing act, with $10.3 million in ticket sales.
Following the death of Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia in the summer of 1995 and the appearance of ""Down with Disease"" on Beavis and Butt-Head, the band experienced a surge in the growth of their fan base and an increased awareness in popular culture. In their tradition of playing a well-known album by another band for Halloween, Phish contracted a full horn section for their performance of The Who's Quadrophenia in 1995.
Phish's first live album, A Live One, was released during the summer of 1995 and featured selections from various concerts from their 1994 winter tour. The album charted at number 18 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and was reported to have sold around 50,000 copies in its first week on sale. A Live One became Phish's first RIAA-certified gold album in November 1995. In 1997, A Live One became the band's first Platinum album, certified for sales of 1 million copies in the United States, and remains their best selling album to date.
Phish ended 1995 with their first New Year's Eve concert at Madison Square Garden. The concert was released in its entirety on the live album Phish: New Year's Eve 1995 – Live at Madison Square Garden in 2005.

Billy Breathes, The Story of the Ghost, and The Siket Disc: 1996–1999
In early 1996, Anastasio and Fishman formed a free jazz side-project called Surrender to the Air, inspired by the music of Sun Ra, which also featured Marshall Allen, Michael Ray, John Medeski, Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Marc Ribot, among other musicians. The group's only album, Surrender to the Air, was released in March.
Following an appearance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in April 1996, Phish spent the summer of that year opening for Santana on their European tour. In August 1996, the band held their first festival, The Clifford Ball, at the decommissioned Plattsburgh Air Force Base on the New York side of Lake Champlain. The festival attracted 70,000 attendees, making it both Phish's biggest concert crowd to that point and the largest single concert by attendance in the United States in 1996. Phish recorded their sixth album Billy Breathes in the winter and spring of 1996, and the album was issued in October of that year. The album's first single, ""Free"", peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and was their most successful song on both charts.
By 1997, Phish's concert improvisational ventures were developing into a new funk-inspired long form jamming style. Vermont-based ice cream conglomerate Ben & Jerry's launched ""Phish Food"" that year. The band officially licensed their name for use with the product, the only time they have ever allowed a third-party company to do so, and were directly involved with the creation of the flavor. Proceeds from the flavor are donated to the band's non-profit charity The WaterWheel Foundation, which raises funds for the preservation of Vermont's Lake Champlain. On August 8, 1997, Phish webcast one of their concerts live over the internet for the first time.
On August 16 and 17, 1997, Phish held their second festival, The Great Went, over two days at the Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, near the Canada–United States border. In October 1997, the band released their second live album Slip Stitch and Pass, which featured selections from their March 1997 concert at the Markthalle Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany.
Following the Great Went, the band embarked on a fall tour that was dubbed by fans as the ""Phish Destroys America"" tour after a 1970s kung fu-inspired poster for the opening date in Las Vegas. The 21-date tour is considered one of the group's most popular and acclaimed tours, and several concerts were later officially released on live album sets such as Live Phish Volume 11 in 2002. Phish ended 1997 as one of the ten highest grossing concert acts in the United States that year.
In April 1998, the band embarked on the Island Tour - a four night tour with two shows at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on Long Island and another two at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. The four concerts are highly regarded by fans due to the band's exploration of a jazz-funk musical style they had been playing for the previous year, which Anastasio dubbed ""cowfunk"". The band performed the tour in the middle of studio sessions for their seventh album, and were inspired by the quality of their performances to further incorporate the cowfunk style into subsequent sessions. The resulting album, The Story of the Ghost, was released in October 1998. The album's first single ""Birds of a Feather"", which had been premiered on the Island Tour, became a #14 hit on Billboard's Adult Alternative Songs chart. To promote The Story of the Ghost, Phish performed several songs from the album on the public television music show Sessions at West 54th in October 1998, and were interviewed for the program by its host David Byrne of Talking Heads.

In the summer of 1998, the band held Lemonwheel, their second festival at Loring Air Force Base in Maine. The two-day event attracted 60,000 attendees. The band played another summer festival in 1999, called Camp Oswego and held at the Oswego County Airport in Volney, New York. Unlike other Phish festivals, Camp Oswego featured a prominent second stage of additional performers aside from Phish, including Del McCoury, The Slip and Ozomatli.
In July 1999, the band released an album of improvisational instrumentals titled The Siket Disc. The band followed that release with Hampton Comes Alive, a six-disc box set released in November 1999, which contained the entirety of their performances on November 20 and 21, 1998 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. The set marked the first time that complete recordings of Phish concerts were officially released by Elektra Records.

To celebrate the new millennium, Phish hosted a two-day outdoor festival at the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation in Florida in December 1999. The festival's climactic New Year's Eve concert, referred to by fans as simply ""The Show"", started at 11:35 p.m. on December 31, 1999, and continued through to sunrise on January 1, 2000, approximately eight hours later. The band's performance of the song ""Heavy Things"" at the festival was broadcast live as part of ABC's 2000 Today millennium coverage, giving the band their biggest television audience up to that point. 75,000 people attended the sold-out two-day festival. In 2017, Rolling Stone named the Big Cypress festival one of the ""50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years"".

Farmhouse and hiatus: 2000–2002
Following the Big Cypress festival, the band issued their ninth studio album Farmhouse in May 2000. ""Heavy Things"", which was released as the album's first single, became the band's only song to appear on a mainstream pop radio format, reaching #29 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart that July. The song also became the band's biggest hit to date on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, reaching #2 there. In June 2000, the band embarked on a seven-date headlining tour of Japan. In July, they taped an appearance on the PBS music show Austin City Limits, which was aired in October.
In the summer of 2000, the band announced that they would take their first ""extended time-out"" following their upcoming fall tour. Anastasio officially announced the impending hiatus to the band's fans during their September 30 concert at the Thomas & Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada. During the tour's last concert on October 7, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, the band made no reference to the hiatus, and left the stage without saying a word following their encore performance of ""You Enjoy Myself"", as The Beatles' ""Let It Be"" played over the venue's sound system.
Bittersweet Motel, a documentary film about the band directed by Todd Phillips, was released in August 2000, shortly before the hiatus began. The documentary captures the band's 1997 and 1998 tours, the Great Went festival and the recording of The Story of the Ghost. Phish were nominated in two categories at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001: Best Boxed Recording Package for Hampton Comes Alive and Best Instrumental Rock Performance for ""First Tube"" from Farmhouse.
During Phish's hiatus, Elektra Records continued to issue archival releases of the band's concerts on compact disc. Between September 2001 and May 2003, the label released 20 entries in the Live Phish Series. These multi-disc sets featured complete soundboard recordings of concerts that were particularly popular with the band and their fanbase, similar to the Grateful Dead's Dick's Picks archival series. In November 2002, the label released the band's first concert DVD, Phish: Live in Vegas, which featured the entirety of the September 2000 concert at which Anastasio announced the hiatus.
In April 2002, Phish guest starred on the episode ""Weekend at Burnsie's"" of the animated series The Simpsons. The episode marked the band's first appearance together, albeit as animated characters, since the hiatus began. Phish provided their own voices for the episode and performed a snippet of ""Run Like an Antelope"".

Return, Round Room, Undermind, and disbandment: 2002–2004
In August 2002, Phish's manager John Paluska announced the band planned to end their hiatus that December with a New Year's Eve concert at Madison Square Garden. They also recorded Round Room over the course of four days in October and released it on December 10. The band had initially planned to record the new album live at the Madison Square Garden concert, but instead felt that demos they had recorded of the material were strong enough to merit release as a studio album. Four days after the release of Round Room, the band appeared as a musical guest on the December 14 episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by former Vice President of the United States Al Gore. During the episode, the band debuted the song ""46 Days"", appeared in a comedy sketch, and their song ""You Enjoy Myself"" was featured in a TV Funhouse cartoon segment. During their return concert on December 31, McConnell's brother was introduced as actor Tom Hanks. The impostor sang a line of the song ""Wilson"", prompting some media outlets to report that the actor had appeared at the concert.

At the end of the 2003 summer tour, Phish returned to Limestone, Maine for It, their first festival since Big Cypress. The event drew crowds of over 60,000 fans, and was the band's final festival to be held at Loring Air Force Base. Highlights from the festival were released on a DVD set, also called It, in October 2004. In November and December 2003, the band celebrated its 20th anniversary with a four-show mini-tour of shows in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The December 1 show at Pepsi Arena featured a guest appearance by former member Jeff Holdsworth, who sat in with the band on five songs, including his compositions ""Possum"" and ""Camel Walk"".
On May 25, 2004, Anastasio announced on the Phish website that the band would disband at the end of their 2004 summer tour. He wrote that he had met with the other members earlier that month to discuss the ""Strong feelings I've been having that Phish has run its course, and that we should end it now while it's still on a high note."" By the end of the meeting, he said, ""We realized that after almost twenty-one years together, we were faced with the opportunity to graciously step away in unison, as a group, united in our friendship and our feelings of gratitude."" The band's eleventh – and at the time final – studio album Undermind was released in June 2004. The band's summer 2004 began with two concerts at Keyspan Park in Brooklyn, New York. The first concert was recorded for the live album and concert documentary Phish: Live in Brooklyn, while the second featured a guest appearance by rapper Jay-Z, who performed two songs with the band. Later that summer, the band appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and performed a seven-song set from atop the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater for fans who had gathered on the street.
The 2004 tour finished with the band's seventh summer festival on August 14 and 15, which were billed as their final performances. The Coventry festival was named for the town in Vermont that hosted the event, which was held at the nearby Newport State Airport. 
The concerts were simulcast in movie theaters and on XM Satellite Radio. ""The Curtain With"" was the final song the band performed at their then-final concert on August 15. After Coventry, the members of the band admitted they were disappointed with their performance at the festival; In the official book Phish: The Biography, Anastasio expressed that ""Coventry itself was a nightmare. It was emotional, but it was not like we were at our finest. I certainly wasn't"". The festival weekend was beset by logistical issues, including heavy rain, muddy conditions in the festival area and a traffic jam on Interstate 91.

Post-disbandment and interim: 2004–2008
Following the break-up, the band's members remained in amicable communication with one another. The members also occasionally appeared on each other's solo albums and collaborated on side-projects.
In December 2006, Anastasio was arrested in Whitehall, New York for drug possession and driving while intoxicated, and was sentenced to 14 months in a drug court program. In 2007, while Anastasio was undergoing rehabilitation, the other members of Phish surprised him on his birthday with an instrumental recording they had made for him to play along with on guitar. During his rehabilitation, Anastasio said he ""spent 24 hours a day thinking about nothing but Phish"" and began discussing a reunion with the other members of the band.
In 2005, Phish formed their own record label, JEMP Records, to release archival CD and DVD sets. The label's first release was Phish: New Year's Eve 1995 – Live at Madison Square Garden, which was released in conjunction with Rhino Records in December 2005. The album was named the 42nd greatest live album of all time by Rolling Stone in April 2015. The label subsequently released several other archival live box sets, including Colorado '88 (2006), Vegas 96 (2007), At the Roxy (2008) and The Clifford Ball (2009).
Phish received the Jammys Lifetime Achievement Award on May 7, 2008, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. All four members attended the ceremony and gave a speech, and both McConnell and Anastasio performed, although not together.
In response to a June 2008 rumor that Phish had reunited to record a new album, McConnell wrote a letter on the band's website updating fans on the current relations between the band's members. McConnell wrote that while the members remained friends, they were currently busy with other projects and the reunion rumors were premature. He added, ""Later this year we hope to spend some time together and take a look at what possible futures we might enjoy."" That September, the band played three songs at the wedding of their former tour manager Brad Sands. Later in 2008, the band reconvened at The Barn, Anastasio's farmhouse studio in Burlington, Vermont, for jamming sessions and rehearsals.

Reunion and Joy: 2008–2011
On October 1, 2008, the band announced on their website that they had officially reunited, and would play their first shows in five years in March 2009 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. The three reunion concerts were held on March 6, 7, and 8, 2009, with ""Fluffhead"" being the first song the band played onstage at the first show. Approximately 14,000 people attended the concerts over the course of three days, and the band made the shows available for free download on their LivePhish website for a limited time, in order to accommodate fans who were unable to attend.
When the band decided to reunite, the members agreed to limit their touring schedule, and they have typically performed about 50 concerts a year since. Following the reunion weekend, Phish embarked on a summer tour which began in May with a concert at Fenway Park in Boston. The Fenway show was followed by a 25-date tour which included performances at the 2009 edition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee and a four date stand at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. At Bonnaroo, Phish was joined by Bruce Springsteen on guitar for three songs.

Phish's fourteenth studio album, Joy, produced by Steve Lillywhite, was released September 8, 2009. ""Backwards Down the Number Line"", a single from the Joy album, reached number 9 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart in October. In October, the band held Festival 8, their first multi-day festival event since Coventry in 2004, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. 
In March 2010, Anastasio inducted Genesis, one of his favorite bands, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the museum's annual ceremony in New York City. In addition to Anastasio's speech, Phish performed the Genesis songs ""Watcher of the Skies"" and ""No Reply at All"" at the event. Phish toured in the summer and fall of 2010, and their concerts at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin and the Utica Memorial Auditorium in Utica, New York were issued as CD/DVD sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

Fuego and Big Boat: 2011–2016
Phish's ninth festival, Super Ball IX, took place at the Watkins Glen International race track in Watkins Glen, New York on July 1–3, 2011. It was the first concert to take place at Watkins Glen International since Summer Jam at Watkins Glen in 1973. In September, the band played a benefit concert in Essex Junction, Vermont which raised $1.2 million for Vermont flood victim relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene.
In June 2012, Phish headlined Bonnaroo 2012 with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead. During their 2013 Halloween concert at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the band played twelve new songs from their upcoming album, which at the time had the working title Wingsuit and would later be renamed Fuego. During the concert, the band was joined onstage by actor Abe Vigoda, who is mentioned by name in the song ""Wombat"", dressed in a wombat costume.
Phish ended 2013 with a New Year's Eve concert at Madison Square Garden that also celebrated their 30th anniversary, as they had played their first concert in December 1983. The concert featured a nine-minute montage film celebrating the band's career, and the band performed an entire set in the middle of the arena from atop an equipment truck.
Phish released Fuego, their first studio album in five years, on June 24, 2014. The album peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and became their highest charting album since Billy Breathes reached the same position in 1996. During their Halloween 2014 concert at MGM Grand Las Vegas, the band performed a set consisting of ten original songs inspired by the 1964 Walt Disney Records sound effects album Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House.

In 2015, Phish performed both a summer tour and their tenth multi-day festival event, Magnaball, was held at the Watkins International Speedway in New York in August. Phish's fourteenth studio album, Big Boat, was released on October 7, 2016.

The Baker's Dozen and Kasvot Växt: 2017–2019
Phish played a 13-night concert residency at New York City's Madison Square Garden from July 21 to August 6, 2017, dubbed ""The Baker's Dozen"". Each concert featured a loose theme with performances of unique cover songs and a special doughnut served each night to the audience by Federal Donuts of Philadelphia. No songs were repeated during the Baker's Dozen run, with a total of 237 individual songs performed across the 13 concerts. The complete Baker's Dozen residency was released as a limited edition 36-disc box set in November 2018. A scaled-down triple CD set featuring 13 song performances, titled The Baker's Dozen: Live at Madison Square Garden, was issued simultaneously with the box set.
Phish planned to hold an eleventh summer festival, Curveball, in Watkins Glen, New York in 2018, but the festival was canceled by New York Department of Health officials, one day before it was scheduled to begin, due to water quality issues from flooding in the area. At their Halloween concert that October at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the band performed a set of all-new original material that they promoted as a ""cover"" of í rokk by Kasvot Växt, a fictional 1980s Scandinavian progressive rock band they had created. The Kasvot Växt set was released as a standalone live album on Spotify on November 10, 2018. All four concerts in the 2018 Halloween run were livestreamed in 4K resolution, which marked the first time that a major musical act had ever offered a 4K livestreaming option.

Between Me and My Mind, a documentary film directed by Steven Cantor about Anastasio's life, his Ghosts of the Forest side-project and Phish's 2017 New Year's Eve concert, was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2019. In June 2019, SiriusXM launched Phish Radio, a satellite radio station dedicated to the band's music.

Sigma Oasis and Evolve: 2020–present
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Phish postponed their 2020 summer tour until 2021. Before 2020, Phish had embarked on a summer tour every year since their 2009 reunion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Phish hosted free weekly ""Dinner and a Movie"" webcasts of archival performances on Tuesday evenings until Labor Day weekend, after which they were hosted monthly.
Phish released their fifteenth studio album Sigma Oasis on April 2, 2020. The album was premiered through a listening party on their LivePhish app, SiriusXM radio station and Facebook page. The album consists entirely of material the band had been performing in concert over the course of the previous decade, but had yet to appear on a studio release.
In January 2021, Anastasio told Pollstar that the band was unable to perform or rehearse together due to COVID-19 restrictions and quarantine rules currently in place in the New England states, but said ""As soon as it's feasible, we'll be back.""
Phish performed their first concert since the start of the pandemic on July 28, 2021, at the Walmart AMP in Rogers, Arkansas, having not performed since February 23, 2020. Beginning with their concerts at The Gorge Amphitheatre in late August, the band began requiring attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative test for COVID-19. During their 2021 Halloween concert, Phish debuted a set of new original science fiction-themed material under the guise of the fictional band Sci-Fi Soldier. According to Pollstar, Phish were the ninth highest grossing concert act in the world in 2021, with a $44.4 million gross from 35 concerts. Phish also had the fifth highest concert ticket sales in the world in 2021, with 572,626 tickets sold. 
Due to an increase of cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in New York City, Phish postponed their 2021 New Year's Eve concerts at Madison Square Garden from December 2021 to April 2022. In lieu of the traditional New Year's Eve concert, Phish instead performed a three set New Year's Eve concert on December 31, 2021 from a soundstage they dubbed ""The Ninth Cube"". 
Phish released Get More Down, a studio version of their Sci-Fi Soldier material, on October 31, 2022. In August 2023, Phish performed two benefit concerts at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York for recovery efforts following a flood in Vermont and upstate New York earlier that summer. The band raised $3.5 million for the relief efforts through their two concerts and merchandise sales. The band performed a version of their Gamehendge song cycle at their 2023 New Year's Eve concert at Madison Square Garden, which featured actors portraying the story's characters, and an appearance by actress and musician Annie Golden during the song ""Harpua"".

Phish performed four concerts at the Sphere in Paradise, Nevada in April 2024, and were the second music act, after U2, to perform at the venue. The concerts featured visual effects created by the Montreal studio Moment Factory.
Evolve, Phish's sixteenth studio album, will be released in July 12, 2024. Mondegreen, a four day Phish festival at the Woodlands of Dover Motor Speedway in Dover, Delaware, will be held in August 2024.

Reception and legacy
Phish's popularity grew in the 1990s due to fans sharing concert recordings that had been taped by audience members and distributed online for free. Phish were among the first musical acts to utilize the internet to grow their fanbase, with fans using file-sharing websites such as etree and BitTorrent to share concerts.
In 1998, Rolling Stone described Phish as ""the most important band of the '90s"". Phish have been named as an influence by other acts in the jam band scene, including Umphrey's McGee and the Disco Biscuits Other musicians have also counted Phish as an influence, including Adam Levine and James Valentine of Maroon 5, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead, Brandon Boyd of Incubus, and reggae musician Matisyahu.
Phish's festival events in the 1990s inspired the foundation of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which was first held in 2002. Co-founder Rick Farman, a Phish fan, consulted Phish managers Richard Glasgow and John Paluska about festival infrastructure during the early stages of planning. The festivals also inspired other jam band-oriented concert events, such as the Disco Biscuits' Camp Bisco, Electric Forest Festival, and the Big Ears Festival.
Phish are well known to their loyal fans, called Phishheads, but the group's music and fan culture are otherwise polarizing to general audiences. The tribal nature of Phish supporters has encouraged comparisons of Phishheads to the Juggalos, followers of the hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse. Phish heavily contributes to music-based tourism with their ""traveling communities"" of fans, and they have been simultaneously hailed and criticized for their near-constant tour dates, which bring with them the capital value of tourism and necessitates the increased security and community planning that come with any music festival. Jordan Hoffman of Thrillist explains ""the solace many find in attending religious services is somewhat mirrored for me in seeing Phish,"" and even though Phish fans are generally considered welcoming and friendly, the reception of the group from the outside is often one of unease and confusion. The BBC listed Phish as one of ""Eight smash US acts that Britain never understood"" along with fellow jam bands Dave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler. In describing the band to a British audience, BBC journalist Stephen Dowling wrote ""Attending a Phish gig has become a rite of summer passage for American teens in the same way that attending Glastonbury has for British teenagers.""
The band has a number of celebrity fans, including: Sean Avery, Rocco Baldelli, Drew Carey, Tucker Carlson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Abbi Jacobson, Katy Tur, Aron Ralston, and Bill Walton. Bernie Sanders, who was the mayor of Burlington when Phish formed, described them as ""One of the great bands in this country"" in 2016.
Phish has performed 83 concerts at Madison Square Garden since their debut performance there in 1994. In August 2023, Phish surpassed Elton John as the musical act with the second most concerts performed at Madison Square Garden, behind only record-holder Billy Joel.
In 2019, Billboard ranked Phish as the 33rd highest-grossing concert touring act of the 2010s. In 2022, Pollstar listed Phish as the 33rd highest grossing touring act from 1980 to 2022, with a cumulative gross of $595.8 million. Pollstar also listed Phish as the act with the ninth most tickets sold in that same time frame, with 13.3 million tickets sold.

Musical style and influences
According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, the music of Phish is ""oriented around group improvisation and super-extended grooves"". Their songs draw on a range of rock-oriented influences, including funk, jazz fusion, progressive rock, bluegrass, and psychedelic rock. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as a cappella (unaccompanied) sections of barbershop quartet-style vocal harmonies. The band began to include barbershop segments in their concerts in 1993, when the four members began taking lessons from McConnell's landlord, who was a judge at barbershop competitions. In the 1997 official biography, The Phish Book, Anastasio coined the term ""cow-funk"" to describe the band's late 1990s funk and jazz-funk-influenced playing style, observing that ""What we're doing now is really more about groove than funk. Good funk, real funk, is not played by four white guys from Vermont.""
Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead during the 1990s, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. The two bands were compared due to their emphasis on live performances, improvisational jamming style, musical similarities, and traveling fanbase. In November 1995, Anastasio told The Baltimore Sun, ""When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to. All of these bands I love, you know? But I got very sensitive about it."" Early in their career, Phish would occasionally cover Grateful Dead songs in concert, but the band stopped doing so by the late 1980s. In Phish: The Biography, Parke Puterbaugh observed ""The bottom line is while it's impossible to imagine Phish without the Grateful Dead as forebears, many other musicians figured as influences upon them. Some of them - such as Carlos Santana and Frank Zappa - were arguably at least as significant as the Grateful Dead. In reality, the media certainly overplayed the Grateful Dead connection and Phish probably underplayed it, at least in their first decade."" Anastasio has also cited progressive rock artists such as King Crimson and Genesis as significant influences on Phish's early material. In a 2019 New York Times interview, he observed, ""If you listen to the first couple of Phish albums, they don't sound anything like the Grateful Dead. I was more interested in Yes.""
In his 2018 book Twilight of the Gods, music critic Steven Hyden wrote that he found the Grateful Dead and Phish to have ""significantly different reference points"" in terms of influence and style. The Grateful Dead, Hyden explained, were ""informed by the totality of American music from the first sixty years of the twentieth century: Blues, country, folk, jazz, and early rock 'n' roll,"" while Phish's music contains elements of ""hopped-up bluegrass, jazzy disco, porno-movie funk, Broadway theatricality, and shockingly sincere barbershop harmonies. But it all stems from classic rock."" Hyden observed that ""If the Dead encompasses American music from roughly 1900 to 1967, Phish picks up the story right through the AOR era, from '68 to around the time Stop Making Sense debuted in theaters in the mid-eighties.""

Live performances
The driving force behind Phish is the popularity of their concerts and the fan culture surrounding the event. Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot similar to the ""Shakedown Street"" bazaar held outside Grateful Dead concerts.
Similar to the Grateful Dead, Phish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often segue into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song. Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; these include ""Possum"", ""Mike's Song"", ""I Am Hydrogen"", ""Weekapaug Groove"", ""Harry Hood"", ""Runaway Jim"", ""Suzy Greenberg"", ""AC/DC Bag"" and ""The Lizards"", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.
Chris Kuroda, who has been Phish's lighting director since 1989, creates elaborate light displays during the band's concerts that are sometimes improvised in a similar fashion to their music. Justin Taylor of The Baffler wrote, ""You could hate this music with every fiber of your being and still be ready to give Chris Kuroda a MacArthur ""genius"" grant for what he achieves with his light rig."" Kuroda is often referred to by fans as the unofficial fifth member of the band, and has been given the nickname ""CK5"".
Since Phish fans began to discuss the band's live performances on the internet in the late 1990s, they have developed a widely used framework for analyzing the varied forms of improvisation that would regularly occur during a given show. A January 1997 post by Phish fan John Flynn on the rec.music.phish Usenet group first defined the two ""types"" of jamming that Phish performs in concert. Flynn wrote: ""I think Phish jamming falls into two types of jamming: 1) Jamming that is based around a fixed chord progression 2)  Jamming that improvises chord progressions, rhythms, and the whole structure of the music."" Since then, Phish fans have used the terms ""Type 1"" and ""Type 2"" and Flynn's definitions to contextualize the structure of Phish's shows and songs.
Because Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. In December 2002, the band launched the LivePhish website, from which official soundboard recordings can be purchased. Legal field recordings produced by tapers with boom microphones from the audience in compliance with Phish's tape trading policy are frequently traded on any number of music message boards. Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.
Fans' recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like Ticketmaster. However, tapers are also required to purchase a general admission ticket for concerts. Recordings patched from Paul Languedoc's soundboard were also made until 1994 and circulated among fans.
In 2014, the band launched their own on-demand streaming service, LivePhish+. The platform features hundreds of soundboard recordings of the band's concerts for streaming, including all of their shows from 2002 onwards, as well as all of their studio albums. Phish continues to allow fans to tape and distribute audience recordings of their concerts after the launch of the LivePhish storefront and streaming services.

Books and podcasts
Several books on Phish have been published, including two official publications: The Phish Book, a 1998 coffee table book credited to the band members and journalist Richard Gehr which focused on the band's activities during 1996 and 1997, and Phish: The Biography, a semi-official biographical book written by music journalist and Phish fan Parke Puterbaugh, was published in 2009 and was based on interviews with the four band members, their friends and crew. An installment of the 33⅓ book series on A Live One, written by Walter Holland, was published in 2015. The 2013 book You Don't Know Me but You Don't Like Me: Phish, Insane Clown Posse, and My Misadventures with Two of Music's Most Maligned Tribes, written by music critic Nathan Rabin, compares and contrasts the fanbases of Phish and Insane Clown Posse.
In addition to books, there have been multiple podcasts which have focused on Phish, its music and fanbase as their central topics of discussion. Among the first was Analyze Phish, which was hosted by comedians Harris Wittels and Scott Aukerman for the Earwolf podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014. The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music. Despite its truncated run, Analyze Phish inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, Under the Scales, in 2016. In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts Under the Scales and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands. In September 2019, C13Originals debuted Long May They Run, a music documentary podcast series; The first season, consisting of 10 episodes, focused on Phish's history and influence on the live music scene. In November 2019, the Osiris Podcasting Network premiered After Midnight, a five-episode documentary series exploring the creation, execution, and aftermath of Phish's 1999 Big Cypress festival.

Other appearances
Seattle Seahawks fans began mimicking Phish's song ""Wilson"" by chanting the song's opening line when quarterback Russell Wilson took the field during games. The new tradition started after Anastasio made the suggestion at shows in Seattle. The story behind the ""Wilson"" chant was featured in a 2014 documentary short by NFL Films.

Pink Floyd,"Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experiments, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.
Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two hit singles, ""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play"", and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour (guitar, vocals) joined in December 1967, while Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.
Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"" in protest at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include ""Arnold Layne"" (1967), ""See Emily Play"" (1967), ""Money"" (1973), ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"" (1979), ""Not Now John"" (1983), ""On the Turning Away"" (1987) and ""High Hopes"" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.

History
The founding members of Pink Floyd were Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, who enrolled at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street in Sept 1962 to study architecture, and Syd Barrett, two years younger than the rest of the band, who had moved to London in 1964 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: ""In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me.""

1963–1965: formation
Preceding the band
Waters and Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar, later moving to keyboards. The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.
In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens, Highgate in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters's switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In September 1963, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that ""songs could be extended with lengthy solos"", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar.

1965–1967: early years
Pink Floyd
The group rebranded as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs, and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created and, with his business partner and friend Andrew King, became their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £19,800 in 2021) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band.  Around this time, Jenner suggested the band drop the ""Sound"" from their name.
Under Jenner and King's guidance, Pink Floyd became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday Times which stated: ""At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic.""
In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance was not music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. The band was much better received at the UFO Club in London, where they began to build a fan base. Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, ""leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none of the others could do"", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner.

Signing with EMI
In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry. While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's booking agent, Bryan Morrison, arranged and funded a recording session at Sound Techniques in Kensington. On 15 February 1967, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (equivalent to £96,500 in 2021). EMI released the band's first single, ""Arnold Layne"", with the B-side ""Candy and a Currant Bun"", on 10 March 1967 on its Columbia label. Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967. ""Arnold Layne""'s references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single reached number 20 in the UK.
EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, ""See Emily Play"", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than ""Arnold Layne"", peaking at number 6 in the UK. The band performed on the BBC's Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and around this time the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and Mason described him as ""completely distanced from everything going on"".

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract. As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album reached number six, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: ""I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down"".
Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by giving terse answers to questions (or not responding at all) and staring into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime ""See Emily Play"" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued.

1967–1978: transition and international success
1967: replacement of Barrett by Gilmour
In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set.
Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (equivalent to £600 in 2021). In January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member, intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would ""cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities"". When this proved unworkable, it was decided that Barrett would just write material. In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up ""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play"", instead introduced ""Have You Got It Yet?"" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photoshoot of Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.
Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was ""Nah, let's not bother"", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later said, ""He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him."" In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.
Jenner and King believed Barrett was the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as ""It Would Be So Nice"" and ""Careful with That Axe, Eugene"". Mason said later that Gilmour added greater structure to Pink Floyd's music and that ""we became far less difficult to enjoy, I think"".

A Saucerful of Secrets (1968)
In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to complete their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, which they had begun in 1967 under Barrett's leadership. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, ""Jugband Blues"". Waters developed his own songwriting, contributing ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"", ""Let There Be More Light"", and ""Corporal Clegg"". Wright composed ""See-Saw"" and ""Remember a Day"". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on ""Remember a Day"", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, ""Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'"". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking ""like an architectural diagram"".
Released in June 1968, A Saucerful of Secrets featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release reached number nine, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to ""forget it as background music to a party"". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as ""like a religious experience"", while NME described the song as ""long and boring ... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction"". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they made a second visit to the US. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who, it marked Pink Floyd's first major tour. That December, they released ""Point Me at the Sky""; no more successful than the two singles they had released since ""See Emily Play"", it was their last single until ""Money"" in 1973.

Ummagumma (1969) and Atom Heart Mother (1970)
Ummagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work. Released as a double LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member. Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and received positive reviews. It reached number five, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart.
In October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in England in mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound problems. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was ""A neat way of saying that he didn't ... do anything"". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were ""thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again"". Gilmour once described it as ""a load of rubbish"", stating: ""I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period."" Pink Floyd's first number-one album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.
Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted tool shed at the back of his garden.
In January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd began working on new material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, ""during which time nothing would get [accomplished]. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints"". The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.

Meddle (1971)
Meddle was released in October 1971, and reached number three, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart. It marks a transition between the Barrett-led group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd; Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone wrote that ""not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again"". NME called it ""an exceptionally good album"", singling out ""Echoes"" as the ""Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for"". However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album ""a soundtrack to a non-existent movie"", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as ""so much sound and fury, signifying nothing"".

Obscured by Clouds (1972)
Pink Floyd had already recorded the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969) and part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On the back of More's success, the director Barbet Schroeder asked them to record the soundtrack of his next major project, La Vallée. The band took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Studios in London. During the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with Waters and Gilmour.
Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained ""excessive sibilance"". After recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as Obscured by Clouds, rather than La Vallée. The film was retitled La Vallée (Obscured by Clouds) on its release.
The songs on Obscured by Clouds were all short and economical, with a strong country music influence. The album also featured the EMS VCS 3 synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. ""Burning Bridges"" was one of two songwriting collaborations between Wright and Waters. ""Childhood's End"" was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour until the release of A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987. ""Free Four"" was the first Pink Floyd song since ""See Emily Play"" to attract significant airplay in the US, and the second to refer to the death of Waters' father during World War II. ""Stay"" was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. The closing instrumental on the album ends with a recording of the Mapuga tribe chanting, as seen in the film.

The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)
Pink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the lyrics.

Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described side one as ""utterly confused ... [and] difficult to follow"", but praised side two, writing: ""The songs, the sounds ... [and] the rhythms were solid ... [the] saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled"". Rolling Stone's Loyd Grossman described it as ""a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement.""
Throughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time. A US number-one, it remained on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart for more than fourteen years during the 1970s and 1980s, selling more than 45 million copies worldwide. In Britain, it reached number two, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart. The Dark Side of the Moon is the world's third best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. Disenchanted with their US record company, Capitol Records, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with Columbia Records, who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000 (US$6,178,138 in 2023 dollars). In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records.

Wish You Were Here (1975)
After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as ""falling within a difficult period"" and Waters found them ""tortuous"". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.
Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: ""Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.""
While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he ""sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there"". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US.

Animals (1977)
In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm. The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.
The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for ""Dogs"", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part ""Pigs on the Wing"". Wright commented: ""It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there."" Mason recalled: ""Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately."" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: ""This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.""
Released in January 1977, Animals reached number two in the UK and number three in the US. NME described it as ""one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music"", and Melody Maker's Karl Dallas called it ""[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific"".
Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their ""In the Flesh"" tour. It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit. At the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish.

1978–1985: Waters-led era
The Wall (1979)
In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters's first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former. Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters's childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.
During the recording of The Wall, the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him. Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he ""hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little"". According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions ""without doing anything, just 'being a producer'"". Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to ""have a long battle"" or agree to ""leave quietly"" after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left.
The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since ""Money"", ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)"", which topped the charts in the US and the UK. The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK. It is tied for sixth most certified album by RIAA, with 23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis.
Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the ""Mother"", the ""Ex-wife"" and the ""Schoolmaster"". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances. Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$2,010,835 in 2023 dollars).
The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall. The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue. Waters was screentested but quickly discarded, and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall's storyline as ""bollocks"". Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982.

The Final Cut (1983)
In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.
Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: ""I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut."" Rolling Stone gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it ""a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece"". Loder viewed The Final Cut as ""essentially a Roger Waters solo album"".

Waters's departure and legal battles
Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984). Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.
Gilmour, Mason, Waters and O'Rourke met for dinner in 1984 to discuss their future. Mason and Gilmour left the restaurant thinking that Pink Floyd could continue after Waters had finished The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, noting that they had had several hiatuses before; however, Waters left believing that Mason and Gilmour had accepted that Pink Floyd were finished. Mason said that Waters later saw the meeting as ""duplicity rather than diplomacy"", and wrote in his memoir: ""Clearly, our communication skills were still troublingly nonexistent. We left the restaurant with diametrically opposed views of what had been decided.""
Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd ""a spent force creatively"".
When Waters's lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, on Christmas Eve 1987. In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members.

1985–present: Gilmour-led era
A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)
In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project. Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence ""would make us stronger legally and musically"", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000. 
Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored on the River Thames. Gilmour felt that lyrics had become more important than the music under Waters, and sought to restore the balance. The group found it difficult to work without Waters's creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore. Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been ""destroyed"" by Waters, and their contributions were minimal.

A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To emphasise that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover — the first since Meddle — featuring only Gilmour and Mason. The album reached number three in the UK and the US. Waters said: ""I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate."" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: ""Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all."" Q described it as essentially a Gilmour solo album.
Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters's K.A.O.S. On the Road tour was on occasion, close by, in much smaller venues. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for Pink Floyd's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters's design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.

The Division Bell (1994)
For several years, Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell, in Britannia Row Studios, where Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, they had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where the band worked from February to May 1993.
Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said ""It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album"". However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Gilmour's future wife, the novelist Polly Samson, is also credited; she helped Gilmour write tracks including ""High Hopes"", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, ""pulled the whole album together"", according to Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. The writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: ""the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger"". To avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart.
Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening The Division Bell tour on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994. Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd, in 2004.

2005–2006: Live 8 reunion
On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd at Live 8, a benefit concert raising awareness about poverty, in Hyde Park, London. It was their first performance together in more than 24 years. The reunion was arranged by the Live 8 organiser, Bob Geldof. After Gilmour declined, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event.
The group planned their setlist at the Connaught hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event. At the beginning of their performance of ""Wish You Were Here"", Waters told the audience: ""[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... We're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd."" At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band embraced. Images of the embrace were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said: ""I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity.""
Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: ""The [Live 8] rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it.""
In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which announced that Pink Floyd had disbanded. Gilmour said that Pink Floyd were ""over"", citing his advancing age and his preference for working alone. He and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite.

2006–2008: deaths of Barrett and Wright
Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006. No Pink Floyd members attended. Wright said: ""The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire."" Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert ""Madcap's Last Laugh"" at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed the Barrett compositions ""Bike"" and ""Arnold Layne"", and Waters performed a solo version of his song ""Flickering Flame"".
Wright died of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said that Wright's contributions were often overlooked, and that his ""soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound"". A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed ""Remember a Day"" from A Saucerful of Secrets, written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland. The keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the ""backbone"" of Pink Floyd.

2010–2011: further performances and rereleases
In March 2010, Pink Floyd went to the High Court of Justice to prevent EMI selling individual tracks online, arguing that their 1999 contract ""prohibits the sale of albums in any configuration other than the original"". The judge ruled in their favour, which the Guardian described as a ""triumph for artistic integrity"" and a ""vindication of the album as a creative format"". In January 2011, Pink Floyd signed a new five-year contract with EMI that permitted the sale of single downloads.
On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters's appearance at the event, Gilmour performed ""Comfortably Numb"" at Waters's performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the guitar solos. Mason also joined, playing tambourine for ""Outside the Wall"" with Gilmour on mandolin.
On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including ""Experience"" and ""Immersion"" multi-disc multi-format editions. The albums were remastered by James Guthrie, co-producer of The Wall. In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings, comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.

The Endless River (2014) and Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets
In November 2013, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and ""generally harness studio technology"". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: ""I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.""
The Endless River was released in the following year. Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries. The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997. Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: ""I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end."" There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright. In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were ""done"" and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong.
In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972, comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career. It was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years, compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters's departure. The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder. In November 2020, the reissue of Delicate Sound of Thunder was given a standalone release on multiple formats. Pink Floyd's Live at Knebworth 1990 performance, previously released as part of the Later Years box set, was released on CD and vinyl on 30 April.
In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets, to perform Pink Floyd's early material. The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and the longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt. They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019. Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"".

2022–present: ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"" and conflicts
Mason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, the two remained ""at loggerheads"". A remixed version of Animals was delayed until 2022 after Gilmour and Waters could not agree on the liner notes. In a public statement, Waters accused Gilmour of attempting to steal credit and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd's website and social media channels. Rolling Stone noted that the pair seemed ""to have hit yet another low point in their relationship"".
In March 2022, Gilmour and Mason reunited as Pink Floyd, alongside Pratt and the keyboardist Nitin Sawhney, to record the single ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"", protesting Russian's invasion of Ukraine that February. It features vocals by the BoomBox singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk, taken from an Instagram video of Khlyvnyuk singing the 1914 Ukrainian anthem ""Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow"" in Kyiv. Gilmour described Khlyvnyuk's performance as ""a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music"". ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"" was released on 8 April, with proceeds going to Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief. Gilmour said the war had inspired him to release new music as Pink Floyd as he felt it was important to raise awareness in support of Ukraine. Asked whether he was considering more Pink Floyd music, Gilmour said the single was a ""one-off"".
Pink Floyd removed music from streaming services in Russia and Belarus. Their work with Waters remained, leading to speculation that Waters had blocked its removal; Gilmour said only that ""I was disappointed ... Read into that what you will."" Waters refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and criticised ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"". Shortly afterwards, Gilmour and his wife, Polly Samson, condemned Waters on Twitter as ""a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy megalomaniac"". In March 2023, Variety reported that Pink Floyd had been seeking to sell their back catalogue for some time, but that this had been hampered by infighting.

Musicianship
Genres
Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and its successor Middle Earth. According to Rolling Stone: ""By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music."" Released in 1968, the song ""Careful with That Axe, Eugene"" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group. Other genres attributed to the band are space rock, experimental rock, acid rock, proto-prog, experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop, and psychedelic rock. O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:

Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.

During the late 1960s, the press labelled Pink Floyd's music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock; they gained a following as a psychedelic pop group. In 1968, Wright said: ""It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation."" Waters said later: ""There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing 'Interstellar Overdrive' for hours and hours."" Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.

Gilmour's guitar work
Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, ""the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen"". Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time. In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique: ""[My] fingers make a distinctive sound ... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows."" Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.
In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as ""characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."" According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on ""Money"", ""Time"" and ""Comfortably Numb"" ""cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog."" Brown described the ""Time"" solo as ""a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato."" Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: ""I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... [to get] singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade.""

Sonic experimentation
Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, ""See Emily Play"" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.
Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as ""On the Run"", ""Welcome to the Machine"", and ""In the Flesh?"". He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for ""One of These Days"".
Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.

Film scores
Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee. In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More. The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called ""The Violent Sequence"", later became ""Us and Them"", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds. They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart.

Live performances
Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground.
To celebrate the launch of the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called ""Moonhead"".
In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named ""Algie"". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of ""Comfortably Numb"". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.
During the Division Bell Tour, an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word ""enigma"" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band.

Lyrical themes
Marked by Waters's philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as ""purveyors of a distinctively dark vision"". Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: ""their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference."" Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. Author George Reisch described Meddle's psychedelic opus, ""Echoes"", as ""built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others."" Despite having been labelled ""the gloomiest man in rock"", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics.

Disillusionment, absence, and non-being
Waters's lyrics to Wish You Were Here's ""Have a Cigar"" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes ""Pink"" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the ""dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce"", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.
Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters's father, who died during the Second World War. Waters's lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: ""The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling."" Waters commented: ""it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here"".
O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to ""Comfortably Numb"": ""I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone."" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, ""Jugband Blues"": ""I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.""

Exploitation and oppression
Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the ""powerful sounds and suggestive themes"" of Dark Side with The Wall's portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: ""If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you"", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.
The album's characters include the ""Dogs"", representing fervent capitalists, the ""Pigs"", symbolising political corruption, and the ""Sheep"", who represent the exploited. Croskery described the ""Sheep"" as being in a ""state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity"", a false consciousness. The ""Dog"", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a ""Pig""; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: ""You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too."" However, he also acknowledges that the ""Pigs"" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a ""Dog"" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.

Alienation, war, and insanity
O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon's ""Brain Damage"" with Karl Marx's theory of self-alienation; ""there's someone in my head, but it's not me."" The lyrics to Wish You Were Here's ""Welcome to the Machine"" suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals; the ""Dog"" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. The ""Dogs"" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a ""necessary and defensible"" position in ""a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle"" wrote Detmer. Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall.
War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall, and a recurring theme in the band's music. Waters's father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from ""Corporal Clegg"" (1968), ""Free Four"" (1972), ""Us and Them"" (1973), ""When the Tigers Broke Free"" and ""The Fletcher Memorial Home"" from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream. The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters's upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women.
Waters's lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it ""an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative."" Reisch described The Wall as ""less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness."" The Wall's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is ""crazy, over the rainbow"". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: ""have I been guilty all this time?"" Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for ""showing feelings of an almost human nature"", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters's lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, ""custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies"", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.

Legacy
Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993. The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million.
In 2003, Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included The Dark Side of the Moon at number 43, The Wall at number 87, Wish You Were Here at number 209, and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn at number 347. In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Rolling Stone included ""Comfortably Numb"" at number 314, ""Wish You Were Here"" at number 316, and ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"" at number 375.
In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of ""The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever"". In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to ""a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart"". Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of ""The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, ""Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata [...] Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists."" The writer Eric Olsen has called Pink Floyd ""the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era"".
Pink Floyd have won several awards. In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for ""Best Engineered Non-Classical Album"" for The Wall, and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for ""Best Original Song Written for a Film"" in 1983 for ""Another Brick in the Wall"" from The Wall film. In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for ""Best Rock Instrumental Performance"" for ""Marooned"". In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Swedish Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010.
Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists. David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and the Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to ""Dogs"" from Animals. Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen, Radiohead, Steven Wilson, Marillion, Queensrÿche, Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins. Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-prog subgenre which emerged in the 1980s. The English rock band Mostly Autumn ""fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd"" in their sound.
Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains, opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive. Due to its success, it was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October.

Pitchfork (website),"Pitchfork (formerly Pitchfork Media) is an American online music publication founded in 1996 by Ryan Schreiber in Minneapolis. It originally covered alternative and independent music, and expanded to cover genres including pop, hip hop, jazz and metal. Pitchfork is one of the most influential music publications to have emerged in the internet age. 
In the 2000s, Pitchfork distinguished itself from print media through its unusual reviews, frequent updates and coverage of emerging acts. It was praised as passionate, authentic and unique, but criticized as pretentious, mean-spirited and elitist, playing into stereotypes of the cynical hipster. It is credited with popularizing acts such as Arcade Fire, Broken Social Scene, Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens.  
Pitchfork relocated to Chicago in 1999 and Brooklyn, New York, in 2011. It expanded in the 2000s, launching projects including the annual Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago in 2006, the video site Pitchfork.tv in 2008, and a print publication, The Pitchfork Review, in 2011. It also began covering more mainstream music and issues of gender, race and identity. As of 2014, Pitchfork was receiving around 6.2 million unique visitors every month.
The influence of Pitchfork declined in the 2010s with the growth of streaming and social media. In 2015, it was acquired by the mass media company Condé Nast and moved to One World Trade Center. After the acquisition, the former co-owner Chris Kaskie left in 2017, followed by Schreiber in 2019. In 2024, Condé Nast announced plans to merge Pitchfork into the men's magazine GQ, resulting in layoffs. The merge drew criticism and triggered concern about the implications for music journalism.

History
1996–2003: Early years
Pitchfork was created in February 1996 by Ryan Schreiber, a high school graduate living in his parents' home in Minneapolis. Schreiber grew up listening to indie rock acts such as Fugazi, Jawbox and Guided by Voices. He was influenced by fanzine culture and had no previous writing experience. 
Schreiber initially named the website Turntable, but changed it after another website claimed the rights. The name Pitchfork was inspired by the tattoo on the assassin Tony Montana in the film Scarface. Schreiber chose it as it was concise and had ""evilish overtones"". Schreiber wrote the first review, of Pacer (1995) by the Amps. The record store Insound was Pitchfork's first advertiser.
Early Pitchfork reviews focused on indie rock and were often critical. The Washington Post described them as ""brutal"" and ""merciless"", writing: ""The site's stable of critics often seemed capricious, uninvested, sometimes spiteful, assigning low scores on a signature 10-point scale with punitive zeal."" Schreiber said the site's early period ""was about really laying into people who really deserved it"", and defended the importance of honesty in arts criticism. In 1999, Schreiber relocated Pitchfork to Chicago. He estimated that Pitchfork had published 1,000 reviews by this point.
Around the turn of the millennium, the American music press was dominated by monthly magazines such as Rolling Stone, creating a gap in the market for faster-moving publication that emphasized new acts. Pitchfork could publish several articles a day, greatly outpacing print media. New technologies such as MP3, the iPod and the file-sharing service Napster created greater access to music, and music blogs became an important resource, creating further opportunity for Pitchfork. The contributors Mark Richardson and Eric Harvey said this was an important part of Pitchfork's early popularity, as music fans could share and listen to recordings while reading daily updates.
In 2000, Pitchfork's 10.0/10.0 review of the new Radiohead album, Kid A, written by Brent DiCrescenzo, generated a surge in readership and was one of the first signs of Pitchfork becoming a major publication. It attracted attention for its unusual style and the speed of its publication following the album review. Billboard described it as ""extremely long-winded and brazenly unhinged from the journalistic form and temperament of the time"". While it was widely mocked, it boosted Pitchfork's profile. Schreiber said he understood the review would make Pitchfork subject to ridicule, but ""wanted Pitchfork to be daring and to surprise people"". In 2001, Pitchfork had 30,000 daily readers.

2004–2005: Growing influence and professional growth
In 2004, Pitchfork hired its first full-time employee, Chris Kaskie, formerly of the satirical website The Onion, to run business operations. Kaskie later became the company’s president and co-owner. Pitchfork's first professional editor, Scott Plagenhoef, was hired shortly afterwards. Kaskie and Plagenhoef are credited for turning Pitchfork into a professional operation. It began to scale quickly; the more money it made, the more resources it had for reviews and articles. 
As of 2004, Pitchfork had eight full-time employees and about 50 freelance staff members, most of whom worked remotely and co-ordinated through phone and internet. Pitchfork writers were unpaid for their first six months, after which they could earn $10 or $20 for a review or $40 for a feature. In 2004, following staff tensions about Schreiber's advertising income, Pitchfork started paying writers from their first articles at a slightly improved rate.
That year, Pitchfork published a positive review of the debut album by Arcade Fire, Funeral. It became a bestseller and is cited as the first major example of Pitchfork's influence on independent music, attracting coverage of Pitchfork from outlets such as the Los Angeles Times. The contributor Jess Weiss said the review ""changed everything"". By 2005, Pitchfork was attracting around one million readers a month, with an annual revenue of around $5 million. That year, Schreiber said he would refuse any offer to buy Pitchfork: ""It would change into the antithesis of the reason I started it. This is something I am so in love with — this is my entire adult life's work.""

2006–2010: Expanding operations
By 2006, traditional music media, such as print magazines, music video channels and radio stations, had declined or changed focus, but music listeners still sought a reliable source of recommendations. Without the limitations of print media, Pitchfork was able to champion emerging independent acts that major print magazines, which had to sell millions of copies every year, could not. Schreiber said he felt magazines were ""not even trying to discover new music ... Publications used to take more chances on artists, putting bands on the cover that they thought deserved to be there."" He said Pitchfork was able to take risks as it was not interested in appeasing bands, record labels or advertisers.
In 2006, Pitchfork had 170,000 daily readers and was publishing five album reviews a day, with six full-time employees. Schreiber said that Pitchfork was able to sustain paid freelancers and eight employees, though they were ""always cutting it close"". He said he had attracted interest from investors, but wanted to retain control and that journalistic integrity was his priority. In August 2006, an internal Pitchfork server containing promotional copies of hundreds of albums was hacked, including the upcoming Joanna Newsom album Ys.
In the mid-2000s, Pitchfork expanded its operations. In 2006, it launched the annual Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. The first Paris Pitchfork Music Festival was held in 2011. Kaskie said it was exciting to see acts Pitchfork had championed playing to large crowds: ""We start to see these bands playing in front of audiences 10 times the size of their biggest show ever. That's the goal, man. To put fucking Titus Andronicus in front of 10,000 people."" In April 2008, after acquiring the live music show Juan's Basement, Pitchfork launched Pitchfork.tv, a website displaying interviews, music videos and feature-length films. In November, it published a book, The Pitchfork 500, covering the preceding 30 years of music. 
By the end of the 2000s, Pitchfork had become influential in the music industry, credited for launching acts such as Arcade Fire and Bon Iver. Employees at record labels and record stores would use it to anticipate interest in acts. It was also attracting large sponsors such as American Express and Apple.

2010–2014: Diversification, declining influence and sister publications
The influence of Pitchfork on music careers declined around the turn of the decade, as streaming and social media fractured audiences and reduced the need for gatekeepers. Streaming services began to fulfil Pitchfork's function of helping new artists find audiences, and independent music criticism moved to podcasts and YouTube. Declining music industry revenues reduced advertising spending, and Pitchfork faced competition from advertisers such as Facebook. According to the Los Angeles Times, ""The internet era that birthed Pitchfork's blend of saucy writing, outre tastes and massive popularity [was] by and large over."" 
Over the following decade, Pitchfork shifted its editorial range and style. It began running features and news alongside reviews, coming to resemble a more conventional music publication. It also diversified from indie rock to cover mainstream music including pop, rap and metal, and began covering issues of gender, race and identity in music, influenced by movements such as MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Schreiber said that ""our tastes broadened with age and experience"", and that Pitchfork could make a difference to social causes.  
In July 2010, Pitchfork launched Altered Zones, a blog aggregator devoted to underground and DIY music. In 2011, Pitchfork relocated to Brooklyn, New York. On May 21, Pitchfork announced a partnership with the website Kill Screen, in which Pitchfork would publish some of their articles. Altered Zones closed on November 30. On December 26, 2012, Pitchfork launched Nothing Major, a website that covered visual arts, which closed in October 2013. Pitchfork launched a film website, The Dissolve, in 2013. It closed in 2015,  citing ""financial challenges"". Kaskie later said he remained proud of The Dissolve and that it was ""a huge success from the creative and editorial, design and everything else"".
In 2013, the rapper Chief Keef was arrested for violating a probation sentence by using a rifle in a promotional video by Pitchfork. Staff later described the episode as a low point and an example of how Pitchfork mishandled hip hop artists. In December, Pitchfork launched The Pitchfork Review, a quarterly print journal focused on long-form music writing and design-focused content. Pitchfork planned a limited-edition quarterly publication of about 10,000 copies of each issue, printed on glossy, high-quality paper. It was expected that about two thirds of the content would be original, with the remaining reused from the Pitchfork website. The International Business Times likened the literary aspirations to The New Yorker and the Paris Review.
In 2013, Pitchfork won the National Magazine Award for general excellence in digital media. As of 2014, Pitchfork was receiving around 6.2 million unique visitors and 40 million pageviews every month, with an expected annual revenue growth of 25 to 40 percent. Its primary revenue came from advertising. That August, Pitchfork had 2.47 million unique visitors, more than the websites for Spin or Vibe but fewer than Rolling Stone's 11 million. By this point, Pitchfork was had grown to capacity, and began to seek ways to find investment to fuel its growth and ambition. Kaskie said he spent a year in meetings with private equity or venture capitalists to evaluate their potential investment, but due to the fact they all only sought scale, it wasn’t deemed a logical fit based on Pitchfork’s goals.

2015–2016: Purchase by Condé Nast
On October 13, 2015, the American mass media company Condé Nast announced that it had acquired Pitchfork. At this point, Pitchfork had about 50 employees, with advertising, sales and development staff in Chicago and editorial and video production staff in Brooklyn. Kaskie said ""our needs and wants were converging"", and that Pitchfork needed capital and expertise to expand its publication and festivals. The sale boosted Pitchfork's value to advertisers. 
The Condé Nast CEO, Bob Sauerberg, described Pitchfork as a ""distinguished digital property that brings a strong editorial voice, an enthusiastic and young audience, a growing video platform and a thriving events business"". Previously, Pitchfork's independence had been a key aspect of its image. Schreiber said it would continue to have ""creative independence"". Pitchfork relocated to the Condé Nast offices in One World Trade Center, Manhattan.  
The acquisition triggered concern; the New York Observer wrote that was a ""death knell for indie rock"". The Condé Nast chief digital officer, Fred Santarpia, was criticized when he said the acquisition would bring ""a very passionate audience of millennial males into our roster"". Schreiber responded on Twitter that women were ""a huge part of Pitchfork's staff and readership"" and that Pitchfork aimed to reach ""all music fans everywhere"". 
On March 13, 2016, Pitchfork launched its first new design since 2011. That October, Pitchfork had 4.1 million unique visitors, up from 2.7 million the previous October. With Schreiber aiming to make Pitchfork the world's best repository for music content, Pitchfork began creating videos and retrospective articles about classic albums released before its founding. The Pitchfork Review ended after 11 issues in November 2016.

2017–2023: Departures of Kaskie and Schreiber
Kaskie announced his departure from Pitchfork in May 2017. He had been frustrated by his diminished role under Condé Nast and Pitchfork's reduced autonomy. On September 18, 2018, Schreiber stepped down as the top editor. He was replaced by Puja Patel, who had worked at Spin and Gawker Media, as editor-in-chief on October 15. Schreiber remained as a strategic advisor. He said he later realized that Condé Nast did not understand Pitchfork and had unrealistic expectations of its performance. 
Patel came under pressure to cut costs amid declining traffic from social media, and competition from streaming platforms, which offered a new means for listeners to discover music. Pitchfork staff conflicted with Condé Nast over its attempts to monetize Pitchfork Music Festival by making it into a ""luxury"" experience. Santarpia left Condé Nast in 2018, leaving Pitchfork under the purview of Anna Wintour, the chief content officer. Two former Pitchfork staffers told The Verge that Wintour did not care about music or understand the internet.
Schreiber announced his departure on January 8, 2019, saying he wanted to ""keep pushing boundaries and exploring new things"". The Los Angeles Times said the departure came at a time of ""existential change"" for the media industries, citing the rise of streaming services and social media and the downsizing of many major music publications. That month, Condé Nast announced it would put all its publications, including Pitchfork, behind a paywall by the end of the year. It abandoned experiments with Pitchfork paywalls following criticism from readers. In 2020, Condé Nast laid off the executive editor Matthew Schnipper and the features editor and union chair Stacey Anderson. In 2022 and 2023, Pitchfork had about 3 million unique visitors a month, down by about 36% from 2021.

2024: Merge into GQ and layoffs
On January 17, 2024, Wintour announced that Pitchfork would merge with the men's magazine GQ. Staff including Patel were laid off, leaving around a dozen editorial staff, including some working on multiple Condé Nast publications. Max Tani of Semafor reported that remaining staff at Pitchfork and GQ were ""depressed and embarrassed"" by the merge. As of that month, Pitchfork had the most daily active users of any Condé Nast publication.
Several music journalists and publications reacted with sadness and concern for the future of music journalism. Tani and The Washington Post's Chris Richards expressed disgust that Pitchfork, once independent and provocative, would be absorbed into an establishment men's magazine. The American critic Ann Powers wrote that the merge felt ""like a highly conservative move at a time when music has proven to be one of our culture's most beautifully progressive spaces"". 
In The Guardian, Laura Snapes wrote that Pitchfork had provided a vital ""leading example"" and doubted that specialist music journalism could survive without it. She lamented the job losses, saying that Pitchfork had been one of the last stable employers of freelance music writers. Schreiber said ""people are premature to eulogize Pitchfork because there are still a handful of people there who are continuing its mission, albeit with a skeleton crew of a staff"". He said he was pleased with the work Pitchfork had published since the announcement of the merge.

Style
Pitchfork attracted attention for its unusual, passionate and stylized reviews, which differentiated it from the more scholarly and formal style of magazines such as Rolling Stone. The critic Steve Hyden said Pitchfork offered an alternative to music magazines at the end of the 20th century, which were publishing content about Star Wars, nu metal and pop punk. He characterized the Pitchfork voice as that of the outsider mocking the mainstream. Pitchfork contributors said the site was immediately divisive among music fans.
In the Washington Post, J. Freedom du Lac described Pitchfork as entertaining, ""hilariously snarky"" and ""occasionally even enlightening"". The Los Angeles Times writer August Brown described it as ""raucous, passionate, sometimes blinkered but always evolving"". In Slate, Matthew Shaer wrote that the best Pitchfork reviews were ""cagey, fierce, witty and graceful"". The journalist Dave Itzkoff described Pitchfork reviews as ""defiantly passionate and frustratingly capricious"" with an ""aura of integrity and authenticity that made such pronouncements credible, even definitive, to fans ... insinuating themselves into the grand tradition of rock criticism, joining the ranks of imperious and opinionated writers"". Schreiber described the reviews of one early Pitchfork writer, Brent DiCrescenzo, as dense with dialogue and pop culture references, ""exploring outlandish scenarios"".
Pitchfork's style changed in the 2010s as it broadened its scope and audience, shifting to poptimism. The contributor Craig Jenkins said the site had needed to change its ""walled-in"" perspective, and that it had been ""antagonistic toward the stuff that the average person would be appreciating"". Plagenhoef felt that the inflammatory ""stunt reviews"" were limiting, and wanted Pitchfork to be seen as trustworthy and thoughtful. Snapes said some had lamented the change, suggesting that it made Pitchfork ""a less specific proposition"". However, she felt it reflected modern music consumption and found it heartening that Pitchfork was reviewing a variety of genres and artists. Under Puja Patel, who became the editor in 2018, Pitchfork covered more female, non-binary, queer and non-white artists.
Pitchfork also switched to a more professional style. The editor Amy Phillips illustrated this by comparing her coverage of the announcement of two Radiohead albums, years apart; the first was excitable and ""unhinged"", whereas the second was more professional and factual. In 2014, the contributor Nate Patrin said Pitchfork had become ""what publications like the Village Voice used to be in terms of letting writers go deep without feeling pressured to talk down to readers"", with long-form articles and documentaries. By 2017, according to Bloomberg, its reviews had become ""as erudite as those of the music magazines that Pitchfork had all but eclipsed in influence"". The critic Ann Powers wrote in 2024 that ""in the past decade Pitchfork had nurtured many of the best and most influential writers working today"". She felt that ""great music writing messes with productivity by creating a space to slow down and really immerse in someone else's creative work ... The best writing at Pitchfork or anywhere reflects that process and is as variegated as the human experience itself.""
In 2012, a Pitchfork poll asking readers to vote for their favorite music found that 88% of respondents were male. Statistics recorded by Quantcast found that men comprised 82% of Pitchfork readers and that most were aged 18–34. In 2015, The Guardian credited Pitchfork for pioneering design techniques that combined print design and technical innovation to create the impression of a ""forward-facing, vibrant title"".

Review system
Pitchfork reviews do not represent an editorial consensus but the opinion of the individual reviewer. Writers who did not want to use their names used the pseudonym Ray Suzuki, similarly to the filmmaker psuedonym Alan Smithee. By 2021, Pitchfork had published more than 28,000 reviews.
Unlike other music publications, which typically assign scores out of five or ten, Pitchfork uses a decimal scale of 0.0 to 10.0. The system has drawn mockery as arbitrary and overprecise. DiCrescenzo described it as ""knowingly silly"", and in 2021 Pitchfork wrote that it was an ""admittedly absurd and subjective"" signature element. 
In The Ringer, Nate Rogers wrote that a 10.0 from Pitchfork ""carries all the historical weight of five stars in Rolling Stone or five mics in The Source ... with its maddening and theoretically precise approach to decimal places, such that an ocean of feeling separates an 8.1 from an 8.9."" Though Pitchfork has awarded perfect scores in retrospective reviews, Patel said that it was a ""once-in-a-decade thing"" for new albums.
Some reviews experimented with the score system. The 2005 Robert Polland album Relaxation of the Asshole received a simultaneous 10 and 0; the review for the 2007 Radiohead album In Rainbows, which allowed fans to pay what they wanted to download, allowed readers to enter their own score. After Pitchfork changed its content management system to require a number, these albums were given fixed scores.

Criticism
Prose
Pitchfork reviews have been criticized as pretentious, verbose and inaccurate. Itzkoff wrote that Pitchfork was overwrought and sometimes hard to understand, with an abundance of adjectives, adverbs and misused words. Shaer identified examples of ""verbose and unreadable writing ... dense without being insightful, personal without being interesting"". In City Pages, Thomas Lindsay wrote that its prose was florid and sometimes impenetrable, and contained factual errors. Similar criticisms came from Rob Harvilla of the East Bay Express and Claire Suddath of Time. Responding to criticism in 2006, Schreiber said he trusted his writers' style and opinions.

Elitism
In its early years, Pitchfork was criticized as mean-spirited and elitist, and for publishing reviews that do not meaningfully discuss the music, playing into stereotypes of the cynical hipster. In 2018, the music journalist Robert Christgau described the early years of Pitchfork as ""a snotty boys' club open to many 'critics' ... Too many amateur wise-asses and self-appointed aesthetes throwing their weight around.""
Many scathing early reviews were by Brent DiCrescenzo, who wrote lengthy reviews that rarely addressed the music. For example, his review of the 2001 Tool album Lateralus consisted mostly of a list of the equipment used by the drummer. Some reviews consist only of single images or videos, implying the record is beneath critical analysis. Schaer wrote in 2006 that Pitchfork typically triumphed acts it had ""discovered"" and attacked beloved legacy acts and bands popular on music blogs. Some believed that Pitchfork deliberately waited for excitement to build around an act before dismissing it with a critical review.
Itzkoff argued that the obtuse and confrontational style was part of the Pitchfork business model and made their reviews memorable. He suggested that the writers' lack of training or experience, and the fact that they worked for low or no pay, created a sense of authenticity and undermined the authority of traditional media. Schreiber conceded that Pitchfork had a reputation for snobbery, but said its writers were ""really just honest, opinionated music fans"".

Race and gender
In the 2000s, Pitchfork was criticized for focusing on music made by white men. In its early years, its staff comprised almost entirely white men. In 2007, the female rapper M.I.A. criticized Pitchfork for assuming that her album Kala had been produced entirely by the male producer Diplo. Another Pitchfork writer described the error as ""perpetuating the male-led ingenue myth"". M.I.A. and the singer Björk argued that this was part of a wider problem of journalists assuming that female artists do not write or produce their own music.  The Pitchfork contributor Andrew Nosnitsky argued that hip-hop, not indie rock, was the ""defining music"" of his generation, but that Pitchfork was viewed as the defining music publication for ""purely mechanical and straight-up white-supremacy reasons"".

Parodies
Pitchfork has attracted multiple parodies. In 2005, Pitchfork invited the comedian David Cross to write a list of his favorite albums. Cross wrote that he was surprised by the invitation, citing several insulting Pitchfork reviews of his comedy albums, and instead wrote a ""withering and absurdist"" article titled ""Albums to listen to while reading overwrought Pitchfork reviews"". In 2007, the satirical website The Onion published a piece in which Pitchfork reviewed music as a whole and gave it a score of 6.8. The music blog Idolator ran a feature asking readers to guess which lines came from Pitchfork reviews and which were fabricated. In 2010, the writer David Shapiro started a Tumblr blog, ""Pitchfork Reviews Reviews"", which reviewed Pitchfork reviews and assessed their arguments. It attracted more than 100,000 followers and a profile in the New York Times.

Influence
Spencer Kornhaber of the Atlantic described Pitchfork as the most influential music publication to emerge in the internet age. Alex Young, the founder of Consequence of Sound, wrote that ""the earliest iterations of Consequence of Sound emulated much of what Pitchfork did — especially as it came to creating an editorial voice, developing a consistent content strategy, and packaging a love of music in a compelling way"".
Itzkoff, a former editor for Spin, described the Spin staff checking Pitchfork regularly: ""If it was lavishing attention on a new band, we at least had to ask ourselves why we weren't doing the same: by then, our value as a trustworthy and consistent filter had waned."" The critic Carl Wilson said Pitchfork drove a ""feeding frenzy about band discovery"" in North American music journalism, with publications vying to discover new acts. 
In the 2000s, Pitchfork was credited with ""making or breaking"" musical careers, a phenomenon known as the ""Pitchfork effect"". In 2006, the Washington Post described Schreiber as an ""indie-rock kingmaker"" and wrote that ""an endorsement from Pitchfork ... is very valuable, indeed"". Megan Jasper, the CEO of the record label Sub Pop, said favorable Pitchfork reviews would immediately drive sales and that it became normal for indie rock bands to sell 100,000 records, exceeding expectations. However, poorly reviewed albums received ""a really loud nothing"".  
The managing editor, Scott Plagenhoef, downplayed Pitchfork's influence, saying it merely ""accelerated the process"". After Pitchfork awarded 9.7 to the debut album by Arcade Fire, Funeral (2004), it became the fastest-selling record in the history of Merge Records. Other acts whose careers were boosted by Pitchfork in the 2000s include the Dismemberment Plan, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Modest Mouse, Broken Social Scene, Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens. Schreiber said: ""We wanted to create a roster of artists who people found out about through Pitchfork, who became associated with Pitchfork."" 
After Pitchfork awarded 0.0 to Travistan (2004), the debut solo album by the Dismemberment Plan singer Travis Morrison, his solo career effectively ended. Years later, Morrison described the experience as ""frightening and awful"". Schreiber said he felt bad for him, but that it was important for Pitchfork writers to be honest. Other albums to receive 0.0 include Zaireeka (1995) by the Flaming Lips, NYC Ghosts & Flowers (2000) by Sonic Youth, Liz Phair (2003) by Liz Phair and Shine On (2006) by Jet. The Jet review consisted entirely of a video of a chimp urinating into its own mouth and was widely shared. The authors of the Phair and Sonic Youth reviews later changed their opinions and apologized to the artists.
In Slate, Amos Barshad cited the band Black Kids as the most infamous example of Pitchfork ""at its most deleterious"". Pitchfork's review of the debut Black Kids EP, Wizard of Ahhhs, boosted their career; however, when Pitchfork gave their debut album, Partie Traumatic (2008), a score of 3.3, with a review consisting entirely of a photograph of two frowning dogs and a frowning emoticon, their career collapsed. Plagenhoef said Pitchfork later became more cautious in publishing negative reviews, as they were no longer ""little guys on the internet throwing rocks at big artists"". 
The influence of Pitchfork on musical careers declined with the onset of streaming and social media in the 2010s. In 2017, a senior editor for independent music at the streaming platform Spotify said that Pitchfork no longer had the same impact on artists' popularity. However, according to Tani, ""Even as its GenX and old millennial fans aged and tastemaking shifted to platforms and influencers, Pitchfork remained the premier publication for music criticism, its year-end lists synonymous with critical acclaim.""

Biography
Hawtin was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, and at the age of nine moved with his parents to LaSalle, Ontario, a suburb of Windsor, Ontario, where he was raised before spending time in Detroit, MI. His father worked as a robotics technician at General Motors and was a fan of electronic music, introducing his son to Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream at an early age. He has one brother, Matthew, who is a visual artist and ambient music DJ. Hawtin attended Sandwich Secondary High School in LaSalle.
He began to DJ in clubs at 17. He was mentored by Scott ""Go-Go"" Gordon at The Shelter in Detroit and his early style was a mix of house music and techno. With Canadian DJ John Acquaviva he formed the label Plus 8 in 1989 to release his own tracks under the name F.U.S.E. He dropped out of the University of Windsor, where he was studying film, and Plus 8 went on to release material by artists such as Speedy J and Kenny Larkin. Hawtin adopted his 'Plastikman' incarnation in 1993, releasing the single ""Spastik"" and parent album Sheet One, going on to release a number of albums and touring a live show for the next decade.

Career
Hawtin was among pioneers of the Minimal techno movement that emerged in the early 1990s, where he represented a ""second wave"" of American producers, such as Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks, associated with Detroit techno. In 1996, he released a series of monthly 12-inch singles, entitled Concept 1, which, alongside the work of Robert Hood and other producers, explored minimal techno.

Popol Vuh (band),"Popol Vuh (German: [pɔpl̩ vuː]) were a German musical collective founded by keyboardist Florian Fricke in 1969 together with Frank Fiedler (sound design, fine cut), Holger Trülzsch (percussion), and Bettina Fricke (tablas and production). Other important members during the next two decades included Djong Yun, Renate Knaup, Conny Veit, Daniel Fichelscher, Klaus Wiese, and Robert Eliscu. The band took its name from the Mayan manuscript containing the mythology of highland Guatemala's K'iche' people.
Popol Vuh began as an electronic music project, but under Fricke's leadership they soon abandoned synthesizers for organic instrumentation and world music influences. They developed a productive working partnership with director Werner Herzog, contributing scores to films such as Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), and Fitzcarraldo (1982). The group are associated with West Germany's 1970s krautrock movement and are considered progenitors of new-age and ambient music. Today, Popol Vuh's best-reviewed works are In den Gärten Pharaos (1971) and Hosianna Mantra (1972).

History
The band's name, taken from the Mayan manuscript, has been translated roughly as ""meeting place"" or ""book of the community"". Their first album, Affenstunde, released in 1970, can be regarded as one of the earliest space music works, featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer together with ethnic percussion. This continued for only one more album, In den Gärten Pharaos, and material later to be released on the soundtrack to Aguirre, the Wrath of God, before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favour of piano-led compositions from 1972's Hosianna Mantra forward. This album also marked the start of exploring overtly religious themes rather than a more generally spiritual feeling within the music. The group evolved to include a range of instruments: wind and strings, electric and acoustic alike, combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective.

In 1973, Conny Veit elaborated on the spiritual component of the group's music: ""I refrain from the classification 'church music', although I think it is entirely possible and appropriate that HOSIANNA MANTRA be used as music for church. I realized this record was actually about something else for me. With the means at my disposal I wanted to grasp the original Christian being and feeling in order to convey the correctness of elementary truths in the Christian word. Not as a preacher, but as someone for whom archaic ways of life seem more valuable and right than our own contemporary culture.""Popol Vuh influenced many other European bands with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentation, which took inspiration from the music of Tibet, Africa, and pre-Columbian America. With music sometimes described as ""ethereal"", they created soundscapes through psychedelic walls of sound, and are regarded as precursors of contemporary world music, as well as of new age and ambient. 
The band contributed soundtracks to films of Werner Herzog, including the aforementioned Aguirre, the Wrath of God, as well as Nosferatu, Fitzcarraldo, Cobra Verde, Heart of Glass and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, in which Fricke appeared.
Florian Fricke died in Munich on 29 December 2001 and the group disbanded.
In October 2003 Klaus Schulze wrote:

""Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music. He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music, but soon discovered that he didn't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead. Here, he went on to create a new world, which Werner Herzog loves so much, transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music.""

Poppy (singer),"Moriah Rose Pereira (born January 1, 1995), known professionally as Poppy and formerly as That Poppy, is an American singer, songwriter, and YouTuber. She first earned recognition for starring in surreal performance art videos on YouTube as an uncanny valley-like android who commented on and satirized internet culture and modern society. This led to the release of a pilot for the proposed 2018 surreal comedy online series I'm Poppy on YouTube Premium.
Poppy signed a recording contract with Island Records in early 2014, and released her debut pop extended play (EP) Bubblebath in 2016. In 2017, she signed with Mad Decent and released her debut art pop studio album Poppy.Computer. To promote the album, she embarked on the Poppy.Computer Tour. She released her second album Am I a Girl? in 2018, where she experimented with electropop and nu metal.
In 2020, Poppy signed with Sumerian Records and released her third studio album I Disagree, which incorporated heavy metal and industrial rock and featured lyrical themes and music videos described as ""disturbing"", ""violent"", and ""macabre"". The album spawned four singles, including ""Bloodmoney"", which received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2021, making Poppy the first solo female artist to be nominated in the category.
In 2021, as part of her long-time collaboration with professional wrestling promotion WWE and its NXT brand, she released the metalcore EP Eat (NXT Soundtrack). Her fourth studio album, Flux, was released in 2021 and featured an alternative rock sound. In 2023, she released her fifth studio album, Zig, which was described as dark pop.

Early life
Moriah Rose Pereira was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1995.  She moved with her family to Nashville, Tennessee at age 14. She recalls wanting to be a Rockette as a child, and took dance lessons for 11 years until deciding to be a musician. She was bullied at school for being skinny and quiet, leading her to complete the latter half of her studies via homeschooling. She moved to Los Angeles at the age of 18.

Career
2011–2014: Beginnings
Poppy had her first performance at IndieCove in August 2011, where she covered an Alanis Morissette song. Her YouTube channel was created in October 2011, under the name ThatPoppyTV, alongside another channel, Moriah Poppy, where she posted covers and vlogs. However, all of these videos, as well as the second channel, were deleted in 2014. She performed at social media festivals, including VidCon in June 2012 and DigiTour in June 2013. She was featured on Eppic's song ""Hide and Seek"" in 2013, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. There she teamed up with director Corey Michael Mixter, known by his stage name Titanic Sinclair, to make a series of abstract promotional videos on YouTube.
Her first YouTube skit called Poppy Eats Cotton Candy was uploaded in November 2014. The videos are described by Sinclair as ""a combination of Andy Warhol's pop accessibility, David Lynch's creepiness, and Tim Burton's zany comedic tone"". The channel has been discussed by other YouTubers, including PewDiePie, Social Repose, Night Mind, the Film Theorists, Reaction Time, and the Fine Brothers on their React series. She starred in an episode in which she reacts to children reacting to her videos. She has also appeared in an episode of the web series Good Mythical Morning.
Sinclair alluded in an interview that Poppy's character in the promotional videos presented itself to him as an android and how some of the concept relates to the uncanny valley hypothesis. Poppy has stated that her YouTube videos tell a story. Her fictional friend Charlotte, a celebrity-interviewing mannequin with a synthetic voice, is a recurring character. She usually appears interacting with Poppy but also on her own. She appears to have developed a drug and jealousy problem after Poppy became famous, which strains their relationship.

In March 2018, Poppy performed ""Moshi Moshi"" at the Japanese pop music festival, Popspring.

2018: Am I a Girl?
On April 17, 2018, Sinclair's former partner Mars Argo filed a 44-page lawsuit in Central California court against Sinclair and Poppy alleging copyright infringement, stating that Sinclair based Poppy's online persona on theirs, as well as emotional and physical abuse Sinclair had allegedly subjected them to in the period after their separation and the subsequent abandonment of the project. On May 7, Poppy made a public statement about the ""frivolous"" lawsuit, saying Argo was attempting to manipulate her psychologically. She called the suit a ""publicity campaign"" and a ""desperate grab for fame"". The Sinclair case was settled out of court on September 14 ""with no money exchanging hands"". The copyright case against Poppy was dismissed.
In July 2018, Poppy released a cover of Gary Numan's song ""Metal"" as a single on all digital platforms. Poppy's second studio album Am I a Girl? was released on October 31, 2018.

She stated that Sinclair ""lives an illusion that he is a gift to this earth"". Responding to the fan speculations that some of her videos were ""secret cries for help"", Poppy noted that while it was not intentional, the videos projected a facet of reality and ""people online sensed it a lot sooner than I did"". Poppy stated regarding Mars Argo's allegations against Sinclair, ""I was never 'an accomplice' to [Sinclair's] past actions like some believe — I was a person who suffered similar wrong doings as [Argo] brought to light.""

Artistry and image
Musical style and influences
Poppy's musical style has been described as pop, heavy metal, rock, electronic, industrial, and experimental. More specifically, her music has covered various other genres including electropop, bubblegum pop, nu metal, pop-metal, dance-pop,  art pop, experimental pop, synth-pop, avant-garde pop, dream pop, shoegaze, pop rock, pop punk, hyperpop, hard rock, noise, ambient, grunge, metalcore, alternative pop, alternative rock, industrial metal, and industrial rock.
Poppy has been compared to artists such as Grimes, Icona Pop, Melanie Martinez, and Charli XCX. Poppy has described herself as a ""kawaii Barbie child"". She has described her music style as ""music [that] makes you want to rule the world."" Poppy states that she drew inspiration from genres such as J-pop and K-pop, as well as reggae. She recalls beginning to write music in 2012. She told Tiger Beat her musical inspirations are Cyndi Lauper, unicorns and Elvis Presley. She is a fan of Jimmy Eat World, No Doubt, Norma Jean, Blondie, Gary Numan, Of Montreal, and Madonna.

Public persona
Poppy has said that her stage name originated as a nickname given to her by a friend. A natural brunette, she has dyed her hair many colors, usually to match the aesthetic of each of her albums' respective eras.
Poppy's identity was initially kept guarded. She explained in 2016, ""I don't want people to talk about how old I am; I want them to talk about what I'm making. [...] People, especially nowadays, are so obsessed with knowing everything. They'll have to invest their time in finding it."" In 2018, she tweeted that she originally kept her identity guarded due to being a survivor of past abuse.

Critical reception
Critics have both praised the catchiness of Poppy's music and described her persona as distant from reality. Racked called her ""sweet, but alien"" and ""brightly addictive"". In a review of I Disagree, Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic called it ""a metallic storm, informed by pulsing beats, thrashing riffs, and crushing breakdowns. That fury is punctuated by atmospheric electronics and sugary vocals that support her deceptively confrontational lyrics."" David Mogendorff, who works in artist content and services for YouTube and Google Play Music, said she has ""a strong J- and K-pop influence"".
Poppy's YouTube channel is often regarded as a commentary on social media. Vice described the tone of the channel, saying in 2022, ""If you have the patience to work your way through all the videos on this channel, certain trends start to emerge. The most obvious is Poppy's fixation with the internet and social media culture, which she claims to love. But far more interesting is the general tone of the videos, which have gotten progressively darker over the last two years."" Gita Jackson of Kotaku suggested the videos are a commentary on the experience of being online, writing, ""In a way, she's made every YouTube video, ever. Her channel is an index of every insincere apology, desperate bid for views and assurance that they couldn't do it without her fans you'll ever see. That Poppy is not only skewering the absurdity of people who make a living as public figures on the internet—she has it out for the entire experience of being online."" Mogendorff said the videos are ""like social commentary... touch[ing] on the anxieties of modern life"" and ""a really interesting way of communicating, personal but strange"".
V magazine listed Poppy as part of the new generation of music, saying that ""her hatched-from-an-egg, Glinda the Good Witch vibes have inspired labels from 'human ASMR' to a one-woman 'digital rabbit hole', none of which seem to stick"". Paper magazine also listed Poppy as one of the 100 women revolutionizing pop music, noting that ""no matter what Poppy does, we can learn to expect the unexpected"". Alternative Press cited Poppy in their list of 20 artists who defined the sound of nu-metal.

Personal life
Poppy's potential gender questioning was one of the main themes of Am I a Girl?. In a 2019 interview, she stated that she identified as a woman and that she believes ""everyone should be able to identify with whatever they choose"".
In October 2019, Poppy began dating rapper Ghostemane. In July 2020, she announced on social media that the two were engaged. The couple separated and called off their engagement in late 2021.
In April 2020, Poppy began to post stylized make-up tutorials on her YouTube channel. She tweeted to explain, ""My ex-boyfriend would always tell me I looked ugly without make-up on, and I should never been seen without it."" She also claimed that the same ex-boyfriend was leaking her unreleased videos, photographs of her without make-up, and ""very personal demos that only he has"" such as a cover of the Pokémon theme song. In response to the alleged leak, she posted the cover of the Pokémon theme song herself.
Poppy is friends with rock singer Marilyn Manson.

Porcupine Tree,"Porcupine Tree are  an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. During an initial career spanning more than twenty years, they earned critical acclaim from critics and fellow musicians, developed a cult following, and became an influence for new artists. The group carved out a career at a certain distance away from mainstream music, being described by publications such as Classic Rock and PopMatters as ""the most important band you'd never heard of"".
The band began as a solo project for Wilson, who initially created all of the band's music himself. By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri as keyboardist, Colin Edwin as bassist, and Chris Maitland as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and Gavin Harrison was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked various styles of psychedelic rock, space rock and experimental rock, later moving towards a more progressive/space rock direction comparable to that of Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. 
In 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album The Incident, the band became publicly inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. However, Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison continued to intermittently work on material in secrecy over the course of the following decade, leading to the release of their album Closure/Continuation on 24 June 2022.

History
Origins (1987–1990)
Porcupine Tree originated in 1987 as a collaborative hoax project by Steven Wilson and Malcolm Stocks. Partially inspired by the psychedelic/progressive bands of the 1970s, such as Pink Floyd, that had dominated the music scene during their youth, the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named The Porcupine Tree. The two fabricated a detailed back-story including information on alleged band members and album titles, as well as a ""colourful"" history which purportedly included events such as a meeting at a 1970s rock festival and several trips in and out of prison. As soon as he had put aside enough money to buy his own studio equipment, Wilson obliged this creation with several hours of music to provide ""evidence"" of its existence. Although Stocks provided a few passages of treated vocals and experimental guitar playing, his role in the project was mostly offering occasional ideas, with the bulk of the material being written, recorded, played, and sung by Wilson.
At this point, Porcupine Tree was little more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, No-Man, an endeavour with UK based singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. However, by 1989, he began to consider some of the Porcupine Tree music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long cassette titled Tarquin's Seaweed Farm under the name of Porcupine Tree. Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an eight-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed Porcupine Tree backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.
Wilson sent out copies of Tarquin's Seaweed Farm to several people he felt would be interested in the recordings. Nick Saloman, the cult UK guitarist better known as The Bevis Frond, had suggested that he send one to Richard Allen, a writer for the UK counter-cultural magazine Encyclopaedia Psychedelica and co-editor of the UK psychedelic garage rock magazine Freakbeat. Allen reviewed the tape in both magazines. Whilst he disliked some of the material, he gave much of it a positive review. Several months later, Allen invited Wilson to contribute a track to the double LP A Psychedelic Psauna that was being put together to launch the new Delerium label. Allen would also become the band's manager, press agent, and promoter until 2004, his role in marketing the band's image decreasing after The Sky Moves Sideways album. In the meantime, Wilson had continued to work on new material. In 1990, he released the Love, Death & Mussolini EP, issued in a very limited run of 10 copies.  The EP remains an extremely rare, collectible piece. It was composed of nine at-the-time-unreleased tracks, as a preview for the upcoming second album. In 1991, Wilson released a second full-length Porcupine Tree cassette called The Nostalgia Factory, which further expanded Porcupine Tree's underground fanbase, although at this point, the band was still carrying on the charade of being 1970s rock legends. By this point, Porcupine Tree was entirely a solo project, with Stocks having amicably moved on to other activities.

The Delerium years (1991–1997)
On the Sunday of Life...
Along with the A Psychedelic Psauna compilation, which featured the Porcupine Tree track ""Linton Samuel Dawson"", the newly formed Delerium label, formed by Freakbeat editors Richard Allen and Ivor Trueman, offered to reissue the cassettes Tarquin's Seaweed Farm and The Nostalgia Factory. Two hundred copies of each cassette were sold through Freakbeat's mail order, The Freak Emporium, and soon Porcupine Tree became known as a mysterious new act amongst the then UK underground psychedelic music scene.
Shortly thereafter, Delerium invited Wilson to sign as one of the label's founder artists. The first release after this, a double vinyl album and single CD compiling the best material from his two cassettes, was released in mid-1992 as On the Sunday of Life, a title chosen from a long list of possible nonsense titles compiled by Richard Allen. The rest of the music from the initial tapes was released on the limited edition compilation album Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape.
In 1992, Delerium released On the Sunday of Life as an edition of 1,000 copies, complete with a deluxe gatefold sleeve. The album sold very well, particularly in Italy, and it was briefly repressed on vinyl and has remained in print on CD ever since its release. The album featured future concert favourite and frequent encore song ""Radioactive Toy"". By 2000, On the Sunday of Life... had accumulated sales of more than 20,000 copies. On the Sunday of Life was originally meant to be a quadruple (LP)/double (CD) album compiling both cassettes in full, but changed to the best (according to Wilson) songs from the tapes. In 2004, Wilson remixed and remastered all three tapes, releasing them as a three-CD box set called Footprints: Cassette Music 1988-1992. This box was only distributed to family and friends.

Up the Downstair
In the midst of Porcupine Tree's rising success, Wilson's other band, No-Man, had been getting excellent UK press, which led to the band being signed to leading UK independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing, in 1991, which resulted in recording agreements with One Little Indian Records, and Epic 440/Sony in the US. No-Man's success gave Wilson the opportunity to leave his regular job and devote his time solely to music. All of the Delirium releases were published by Hit & Run, whose executive Dave Massey had signed No-Man and continued to be closely involved in Wilson's Porcupine Tree project.
In May 1993, the second Porcupine Tree album, Up the Downstair, was released, another prospective double album that was finally slimmed down to a single record. ""Voyage 34"" was actually going to take up the second disc, but it was last decided to be released alone as a single. The album was highly praised, Melody Maker describing it as ""a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year."" The album continued the fusion of electronic music and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, Richard Barbieri, of 1970s-80s art rock band Japan, and Colin Edwin.
In November 1993, Voyage 34 was reissued alongside an additional 12-inch remix by Astralasia. The album managed to enter the NME indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic, even without radio play.

The Sky Moves Sideways
The profile of Porcupine Tree had now grown to the extent that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances. Thus, in December 1993, Porcupine Tree became a live unit featuring Steven Wilson on lead vocals/guitar, Colin Edwin on bass, Chris Maitland on drums, and Richard Barbieri on keyboards.

All three new members of the group had worked with Wilson on various projects over the preceding years, especially Barbieri and Maitland, who had been part of No-Man's touring band. The new line-up's first live album, Spiral Circus, contained recordings from their first three performances, including a BBC Radio One session for Mark Radcliffe, an early champion of the group.
Porcupine Tree's next album did not emerge until early 1995, but was preceded by the Moonloop EP, the last two tracks of which were recorded during the album sessions and were the first to feature the new band. Released in 1995, the band's third studio album, The Sky Moves Sideways became a success among progressive rock fans and Porcupine Tree were hailed as the Pink Floyd of the 1990s. Wilson later lamented this, stating, ""I can't help that. It's true that during the period of The Sky Moves Sideways, I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums any more. Moreover, I regret it"".
The Sky Moves Sideways was an expansive soundscape of melody and ambient rock experimentation, but proved to be a transitional work, with half recorded before the formation of the band and half recorded after. Most of the album was taken up with the 35-minute title track, which at one point Steven had intended to be long enough to occupy the whole album. An alternate version of the track, containing some of the excised music, was included on the 2004 remastered version of the album. It also entered the NME, Melody Maker, and Music Week charts. Together with the Moonloop EP, this album was the first Porcupine Tree music issued in America in the autumn of 1995, and attracted favourable press on both sides of the Atlantic. The band supported the album with numerous concerts throughout the year at major music venues in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece.

Signify
Partly unsatisfied with the half band/half solo nature of The Sky Moves Sideways, Porcupine Tree promptly got down to the task of recording the first proper band record. Wilson admitted he was always ""in love with the idea of the rock band"" because ""bands have a kind of glamour, and appeal, and a romance about them the solo projects just don't have."" The band worked sporadically over the next year on developing a tighter and more ambitious rock sound.

After the release of the first real Porcupine Tree single, ""Waiting"", which entered all UK indie charts and the UK National chart and attracting airplay all over Europe, Signify was released in September 1996. The album was a mixture of instrumental tracks and more song-oriented tunes, blending numerous rock and avant-garde styles, such as krautrock. Wilson expressed satisfaction in the direction of the album, stating ""...tracks like 'Every Home Is Wired' and 'Dark Matter' totally transcend both genre and comparison. Finally, I think we are making a completely original and 1990s form of music, but which still has its root in progressive music."" The musicians received writing credits for some tracks, most notably for ""Intermediate Jesus"", which evolved from a jam session later released as Metanoia at the end of 1998. A large amount of major European media interest accompanied the album's release.
In March 1997, they played three nights in Rome to an audience that surpassed 5,000 people. All three dates were recorded for use in the 1997 live album Coma Divine – Recorded Live in Rome that was released as a goodbye to Delerium Records, which felt it could no longer offer the kind of resources the band needed  to continue to build its profile worldwide. In late 1997 Porcupine Tree's first three albums were remastered and reissued. Signify also was released in the US on Miles Copeland's Ark 21 label.

The Snapper years (1998–2001)
Stupid Dream
Wilson, Barbieri, Edwin, and Maitland spent all of 1998 recording their fifth studio album, a release that reflected the band's move towards a more song-oriented writing. Wilson acknowledged this time he was ""much more interested in songwriting as an art form, as opposed to soundscape development"" and commented he took influence from The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Todd Rundgren, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and ""anything with really good ensemble singing"". He also indicated that he was ""interested in the idea of the pop song as a kind of experimental symphony"".

The band recorded the album without a label, but signed with Snapper/Kscope before releasing Stupid Dream, in March 1999. The album was supported by a tour of the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, Poland, and the United States. The three singles taken from the album: ""Piano Lessons"", ""Stranger by the Minute"", and ""Pure Narcotic"", all achieved mainstream exposure in the US and in Europe, and placed well in the UK independent charts and on radio-station playlists. Although the album was a departure from their earlier sound, it brought the band new-found popularity and went on to become the band's best-selling and most acclaimed release up to that time.

Lightbulb Sun
Completed for February 2000, with string arrangements provided by Dave Gregory of XTC, Porcupine Tree's sixth studio album, Lightbulb Sun, built on the mix of songwriting, soundscaping, and rock dynamics of Stupid Dream. The album was released in May 2000, preceded by the single ""Four Chords That Made a Million"". A sold-out show at the Scala in London began a short run of UK shows, that were followed later in the year by European festival dates and a major tour supporting Dream Theater. The band continued touring through the end of 2000 and start of 2001, including their first major tour of Germany. A special double CD edition of the Lightbulb Sun album was issued in Israel and Germany.
In May, the band released a compilation B-side album called Recordings, which featured nine tracks from the Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun sessions that had been left off both albums. In May 2001, Porcupine Tree did three consecutive dates as a support band to Marillion, in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. In June, the band played a short US tour, starting with an appearance in NEARfest of Pennsylvania, and culminating in a sold-out show at The Bottom Line in New York City. Shortly afterwards, the band announced that they had signed a new international record deal with Lava/Atlantic Records.

The Lava years (2002–2005)
In Absentia
In February 2002, Porcupine Tree's first line-up change occurred when drummer Chris Maitland was dismissed after eight years with the band. The band welcomed drummer and longtime acquaintance Gavin Harrison as his replacement. In March 2002, a box set of the band's early work was released, Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997, and the band commenced recording their first major label album, drawing from a pool of 30 new songs written by Wilson in the previous two years. Recording sessions took place at Avatar Studios in New York and London, with veteran audio engineer Paul Northfield and string arranger Dave Gregory also playing major roles in the making of the record. The album was mixed in Los Angeles in May with Tim Palmer.
The resulting album, In Absentia, was released by Lava Records in September 2002. The band also released a 5.1 surround-sound version of the album, mixed by Grammy Award-winning producer Elliot Scheiner. The surround-sound version of the album won the award for best 5.1 mix at the 2004 Surround Sound Music awards in Los Angeles.

To promote the album, the band undertook four tours of Europe and North America, including one with acclaimed Swedish metal band Opeth. On tour, the new line-up of the band was further augmented by additional touring vocalist/guitarist John Wesley. During these tours, the visual element of the band's performance was taken to new heights with the involvement of filmmaker and photographer Lasse Hoile, who had created the cover art for In Absentia and now went on to create a dark and surreal visual to Porcupine Tree's music. The long promotional campaign for In Absentia ended on 30 November 2003, as the band played a homecoming show to a sold-out London Astoria.

During 2003, Porcupine Tree set up their own label, Transmission, with an online store hosted by Burning Shed record label. The first release on the Transmission label was a studio session recorded for XM Radio, Washington, DC, followed in 2004 by a recording from Polish radio in 2001. The band used the label to issue supplemental content, such as EPs, demos, and live recordings. Additionally, a reissue/remaster campaign also began in 2003, with many of the early albums expanded to double CDs. These reissues included re-recorded/remixed double-CD versions of the Up the Downstair, The Sky Moves Sideways, and Signify albums, and the reissue of Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, both consisting of a CD with a new stereo mix of the album plus a DVD-Audio with a 5.1 surround mix.

Deadwing
In early 2004, the band embarked on the recording sessions for their next record, Deadwing, their second for Lava/Atlantic. The album takes its inspiration from a film script written by Wilson with his filmmaker friend Mike Bennion.  The album sessions completed in November 2004, and Deadwing was released in Europe and the US during the spring of 2005 as both a stereo and 5.1 surround-sound album, preceded by the release of two singles, ""Shallow"" in the US and ""Lazarus"" in Europe. The album benefited from guest appearances by Adrian Belew from King Crimson and Opeth's Mikael Åkerfeldt, and was a commercial success, due in part to ""Shallow"" receiving airplay, peaking at number 26 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. Additionally, ""Lazarus"" entered the German singles Top 100 at number 91. The song ""Shallow"" was also featured in the soundtrack for the film Four Brothers.
The album won the Surround Music Awards for ""Best Made-For-Surround Title"" the same year of its release and was voted number-two album of 2005 in Sound & Vision, the most widely distributed US magazine in the field of home electronics and entertainment. Porcupine Tree released Deadwing in Japan on 22 March 2006, the first album by the band to be released in that country.
The tour to promote the album commenced in the UK at the end of March, and continued throughout the year. Mike Bennion created a Myspace page dedicated to the prospective Deadwing film, in which he posted the first 15 pages of the script and included a trailer. However, whilst the scripts are finished, the project is still on hiatus due to lack of budget.

The Roadrunner years (2006–2010)
Fear of a Blank Planet
In August 2006, Porcupine Tree announced that the band had signed with Roadrunner Records UK. Prior to their first release on Roadrunner, the band released their first live concert DVD, Arriving Somewhere..., on 10 October 2006. It was accompanied by a brief tour in which the group performed 50 minutes of new material from the forthcoming studio album for the first half of the shows. Supporting acts included Swedish band Paatos in Europe and ProjeKct Six in the United States.

The band announced the next album's title would be Fear of a Blank Planet in January 2007 and the album was released on 16 April 2007. The album charted in almost all European countries, and peaked at number 59 on the Billboard 200. A 92-date tour for 2007 took the band to countries where they had never performed, such as Finland and Mexico. The tour included appearances in multiple music festivals such as the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, the German twin-festivals, Hurricane and Southside, and the Download Festival of Donington Park. The band performed their first ever shows in Australia in 2008.
The lyrics of the album deal with some common behaviour tendencies concerning society, especially youth, in the beginning of the 21st century, such as bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder, drug abuse, alienation, and deprivation caused by mass media. The concept of the album was inspired by Bret Easton Ellis novel Lunar Park and the title alludes to Public Enemy's album, Fear of a Black Planet, both sharing the particularity of reflecting notorious conflicts affecting society in the world at some time. Wilson notes that whilst race relationship was the main issue among young people when Public Enemy's album was released, it was replaced in the 21st century by a general superficiality, boredom, and introversion. The album features contributions from Rush's Alex Lifeson and King Crimson's Robert Fripp.

Wilson: ""My fear is that the current generation of kids who're being born into this information revolution, growing up with the Internet, cell phones, iPods, this download culture, 'American Idol,' reality TV, prescription drugs, PlayStations—all of these things kind of distract people from what's important about life, which is to develop a sense of curiosity about what's out there.""

On 5 November 2007, Fear of a Blank Planet won the Album of the Year award for the 2007 Classic Rock magazine awards. In December 2007, it was nominated for a Grammy Award for ""Best Surround Sound Album"" though Love by The Beatles won the award.
A new EP called Nil Recurring was released on 17 September 2007, featuring four unreleased tracks from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions and including another contribution from Robert Fripp. The second leg of the tour started on 3 October 2007, now promoting new music from the EP. Nil Recurring entered the UK Top 30 Independent Label Albums at number eight. The EP was reissued on 18 February 2008 through Peaceville Records.
A recording from a 4 October 2007 in-store, mostly acoustic, performance at Park Avenue CDs in Orlando, Florida, was released on 18 February 2008 on CD under the name of We Lost The Skyline. The title is a reference to the lyrics of ""The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One)"", which was the opening song on the live set. The album was released on vinyl of 21 March 2008. While intended to be a full-band show, the lack of space in the store only allowed the two guitarists, Wilson and John Wesley, to play.

The Incident
The band played a short European tour in October 2008 to shoot their second live-concert film, Anesthetize, preceded by three concerts in Australia in April. The filming took place on 15 and 16 October in the Netherlands at the 013 Tilburg venue. During one of these shows, Wilson mentioned that Porcupine Tree had started work on material for their next album, with an eye toward a release in 2009. The live-concert film on DVD and Blu-ray was released on 20 May 2010.
The band started recording their tenth studio album, The Incident, in February 2009. This was confirmed by the band, stating, ""Writing for the next PT studio record is well underway, with the band recently spending two weeks scheduled in the English countryside working on new tracks. Recording of these pieces and a new 35-minute SW song cycle were due to start in February..."" Months later, Wilson commented the 35-minute song kept evolving and now it has become a 55-minute song, occupying the entire disc.
On 12 June 2009, details were revealed on the Porcupine Tree website, ""the record is set to be released via Roadrunner Records worldwide on 21 September, as a double CD. The centrepiece is the title track, which takes up the whole of the first disc. The 55-minute work is described as a slightly surreal song cycle about beginnings and endings and the sense that 'after this, things will never be the same again.' The self-produced album is completed by four standalone compositions that developed out of band writing sessions last December – Flicker, Bonnie The Cat, Black Dahlia, and Remember Me Lover feature on a separate EP-length disc to stress their independence from the song cycle."" The album was the band's biggest commercial success to date, reaching number 23 in the UK album charts and also reaching the US Billboard Top 25.
The band also released another live album, Atlanta, in June 2010. The performance was actually recorded during the tour of Fear of a Blank Planet at the Roxy theatre, Atlanta, on 29 October 2007. It was released via online distribution only, with all the sale proceeds donated to Mick Karn for his treatment against cancer.

Inactivity and hiatus (2011–2020)
After finishing the touring cycle for The Incident in 2010, Wilson spent the rest of the year, and 2011, recording and releasing his second solo album, Grace for Drowning, and Blackfield's third album, Welcome to my DNA. Initially, the band had mentioned the possibility of working on new music in 2012, with Wilson mentioning ""early 2012"", and Harrison guessing they would start work in 2012 and release music in 2013. However, this soon changed, with Wilson announcing that he would continue to focus his future on his solo career. This new focus included a second leg of touring in support of Grace for Drowning in the first half of 2012, recording a third solo album in the second half of the year with his touring band, releasing it in early 2013, and then touring in support of the third solo album for ""much of the year"" – throughout 2013. Wilson still maintained that the band ""haven't split up"" and that there are ""no intentions of splitting up"", but he also said there were no specific plans for a new album either. While he said that he still ""want(s) to get Porcupine Tree back together at some point"", he said that he was not sure what direction he wants to take the band, only that he is ""tired of metal music"", and that one member of the band does not like jazz, so it won't go into the direction of his solo project either.
In June 2012, Wilson re-emphasised his continued focus on his solo career, with his answer to the question ""...is (there) a danger that Porcupine Tree might fall by the wayside?"" being, ""The honest answer is I don't know. The solo career for me now is probably the most important. I think about it more than anything else, I'm more focused on it than anything else, I enjoy it more than anything else..."" A two-disc live album titled Octane Twisted was released that following November by their record label, Kscope, containing a live recording of The Incident in its entirety, from material recorded at 2010 concerts at the Riviera Theater, Chicago, and the Royal Albert Hall. In May 2013, Wilson reiterated his stance on the band's status, stating that it's ""...not to say the band has broken up or anything like that. It's always conceivable that we could get back together in a year or five years, or 10 years. I really can't say – there are no plans at the moment."" Edwin's stance mirrored this.
After Wilson released his third solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories) in February 2013, and toured in support of it for the remainder of the year, its success led Wilson to commit to writing and recording a fourth solo album Hand. Cannot. Erase. over the course of 2014 and releasing it in 2015, pushing hypothetical work with Porcupine Tree into at least 2016. In March 2015, Wilson commented, ""if Porcupine Tree [were] to get back together—and, by the way, I have never ruled that out—it will be a side project. There should be no question in anyone's mind that this is now my main musical path, my solo work.""
Moving into 2016, Wilson's views on a re-formation were conflicting. In February 2016, in an interview with Prog Magazine, he stated that there was a ""strong possibility"" of Porcupine Tree re-forming for another studio album at an undisclosed time in the future. However, in response to a question in August 2016 regarding a hypothetical Porcupine Tree performance, Wilson claimed, ""you'd be waiting for a long time, that band doesn't exist anymore."" In August 2017, Wilson explained: ""It's no coincidence that since my solo project has taken off, other collaborations have receded to the background. Porcupine Tree hasn't made a record since 2009 and No-Man hasn't made a record since 2008. I feel less need now to be creatively involved in something other than my solo work. My solo work fulfills the musical needs I have now.""
In a March 2018 interview when asked about the chances of further activity from Porcupine Tree he responded; ""Honestly, I would say zero, because I'm just not that kind of person. I don't go backwards. I'm not interested in going backwards; I want to move forwards, I want to do different things, I want to work with different people, I want to explore different kinds of music. That would seem like a terribly backward step to me. I'm proud of the catalogue; it's there, it exists, but it's kind of closed, it's finished."" These statements caused an increased tension between him and Barbieri, who was waiting for Wilson to return to Porcupine Tree. However, in February 2021, Wilson suggested that a re-formation was still possible someday, when it was least expected.

Reunion, Closure/Continuation and future (2021–present)
On 27 October 2021, Porcupine Tree, Wilson, and Harrison all shared a teaser video and mailing list link across their social media accounts, along with a stylised ""P/T C/C"" image. On 1 November the band announced their eleventh album, Closure/Continuation, to be released in June 2022 on Music For Nations, along with their first single in over 12 years, ""Harridan"". The lineup of the band now features just Wilson, Harrison, and Barbieri, with guitarist Randy McStine and bassist Nate Navarro being added to the touring lineup. The album was recorded over 11 years in complete secrecy.  Wilson explained Edwin's absence with the two losing contact when the project went on hiatus and stylistic differences, though Barbieri was adamant to say ""I don't want any of this to negatively impact Colin or imply this was somehow his fault."" Closure/Continuation was released on 24 June 2022.
In a March 2022 interview with The Guardian, Wilson addressed the band's future, stating that he was unsure whether this would be the final project by the band or if the reunion would continue past the album. He then stated it was most likely their last album, as he hoped to end the band on a strong note. In a late June 2022 interview with Under The Radar, however, Wilson expressed his interest in making another Porcupine Tree record that will be more keyboard dominant.
The band began the first leg of the Closure/Continuation tour in September 2022, with shows in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile. The tour's second leg, starting in October 2022 and carrying through until November 2022, was composed of select cities in Europe and a single performance in the UK at London's Wembley Arena. Wilson later noted that the band's few 2023 live performances would likely be their last, though he stated that they would like to record again. The show at Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam on November 7,2022 was filmed and recorded and was released on December 8, 2023 as Closure/Continuation.Live.

Musical style
Influences
Some of the inherent musical background of Porcupine Tree goes back to Wilson's childhood, when his parents gave Christmas presents to each other. His father received Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon whilst his mother got Donna Summer's Love to Love You Baby, both of which Wilson listened to heavily. These albums influenced his further songwriting. Other influences include The Beatles,  Camel and Karlheinz Stockhausen.
Later in his teens, Wilson briefly became a fan of the new wave of British heavy metal, but as soon as he discovered 1970s music and progressive rock, his interest in metal diminished in favour of experimental music. He later (in the 2000s) discovered bands in the likes of Gojira, Sunn O))), Neurosis, and Meshuggah, which restored his faith in metal music. ""For a long time, I couldn't find where all these creative musicians were going..."", said Wilson, ""and I found them, they were working in extreme metal."" Shortly thereafter, he went on to produce three consecutive albums by Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth, which had a considerable influence in his further songwriting.
The influence of electronic music and krautrock is present, with Wilson namechecking bands such as Can, Neu!, Tangerine Dream, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin and artists such as Klaus Schulze and Conrad Schnitzler, among others. He has mentioned on multiple occasions that he admires the work of American musician Trent Reznor, the founding member of Nine Inch Nails. Wilson has also cited English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), along with other potentially ""surprising"" influences such as ABBA, The Carpenters, Electric Light Orchestra, and the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack album (1977), largely written and performed by the Bee Gees.

Characteristics
The music of Porcupine Tree is often described as melancholic. Wilson has stated music is a way for him to channel all his negative feelings, and ""an exorcism of those elements within"", finding it ""easier to write songs about the negative side of the world than it is about the happy side of the world."" In the Warszawa live radio broadcast album, before performing ""Stop Swimming"", Wilson can be heard saying ""the saddest music is often the most beautiful.""

Porcupine Tree is an album-oriented band, making records where many songs are related to each other.  Wilson has said: ""The important thing with Porcupine Tree is that all our songs have a unique sound world that they inhabit. I don't like the idea of any song sounding like any other song. So most of the time it's a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path, or particular musical atmosphere, or flavour."" For their recordings, the band has included mellotron, banjo, hammered dulcimer, and guimbri, among other instruments unusual for rock bands.
Above all, Porcupine Tree's music has maintained a strong textural and experimental quality, often fusing many genres in a single track. The band's work is noted for its atmospheric nature, largely due to Barbieri's keyboard style and sound-processing abilities, and Wilson's cinematic scope, as a declared fan of American filmmaker David Lynch, whose films are renowned for their sonic content. ""Very layered, very produced, very arranged and [with] complex arrangements"" is the way Wilson describes the sound of the band. Apart from their regular edition, the albums Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, In Absentia, Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet, and The Incident are available in DTS (5.1 Surround Sound) mix; this mixing technique has become a tradition for the band in recent years.
The band's live performances have also been praised, with Music Radar placing them fourth in their list of ""The 30 greatest live acts in the world today"" in 2010.
Porcupine Tree are often categorised as a progressive rock band. Although many listeners familiar with the group label them as such, Steven Wilson has been noted in the past to express a certain dislike for the use of the term ""progressive"" to refer to them. However, more recently, he made note that he has since become more relaxed toward the word considering it is becoming ""a much broader term"" as time passes. He has frequently stated that he dislikes the press comparing Porcupine Tree with neo prog bands or citing them as 'the New Pink Floyd'.

Legacy
Porcupine Tree have influenced a new generation of artists and bands. 
Anders Nyström of the Swedish group Katatonia has cited the work of Porcupine Tree as a large influence for the band in their post-death metal eras. Luc Lemay, leader of the technical death metal band Gorguts, said that The Incident was ""a big revelation"" for him, inspiring his more recent songwriting. He singled out the concert of its tour as one of the two most important he has attended. Electronic producer Seven Lions also cited them as an inspiration for his dubstep and drum and bass compositions. 
In addition to those artists who state that Porcupine Tree has been a direct influence on their own careers, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work including Neil Peart, Alex Lifeson, Adrian Belew, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, Arjen Lucassen, Rob Swire, Haken and many others.

Owl City,"Owl City is an American electronic music project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota. It is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young, who created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site MySpace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.
After two independent releases, Owl City gained mainstream popularity with its 2009 major-label debut album, Ocean Eyes, which includes the Diamond certified single ""Fireflies"". The album was certified 2× Platinum in the United States, with ""Fireflies"" being certified Diamond in January 2023.
In June 2011, Owl City released its third studio album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, which was followed by The Midsummer Station in August 2012. Owl City has recorded songs for several animated films, including Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Wreck-It Ralph, The Croods and The Smurfs 2. Owl City also has released several charting singles, most notably ""Good Time"" and ""Fireflies"".

History
2007–2009: early years, Of June and Maybe I'm Dreaming
Adam Young has previously attributed the name Owl City to the 1962 short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge among other various answers.
Suffering from insomnia while working loading Coca-Cola trucks, Young began to compose music, recording with a C-1 Behringer Microphone. Among the software that he began with was Reason from Propellerhead. He began uploading songs recorded in his parents' basement to MySpace. ""Hello Seattle"" was the first track written for Owl City, which also inspired the project. After receiving favorable attention for his music, he began receiving emails from major record labels in the spring of 2008. His manager Steve Bursky later highlighted the significance of Young's engaging online manner in building his following saying: ""People feel like they know him, like they've got a direct connection to him because of how he approaches his connection with them online."" Through a deal with the digital aggregator CD Baby, he then started making the songs available for sale through iTunes. In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I'm Dreaming. Of June reached No. 15 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I'm Dreaming peaked on the same chart at No. 13. The song, ""The Technicolor Phase"" from his debut album, was featured in the soundtrack of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.
In February 2009, Owl City signed with Universal Republic. He played his first show to a sold-out crowd at the Varsity Theater in Minnesota. He continued to perform shows from May to June 2009. In May, Owl City performed at the 2009 Bamboozle festival.

2009–2010: Ocean Eyes
Ocean Eyes, Owl City's major label debut, was released on iTunes on July 14, 2009, with the physical release following on July 28, 2009. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 and topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart for four weeks. By April 2010, it was certified Platinum in the United States. The album was mostly recorded in his parents' basement, before Young got his own place and finished it up there. Owl City released his debut single, ""Fireflies"" on July 14, 2009. The song became a commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States for the week ending November 7, 2009. Internationally, the song also topped the charts in Ireland, Australia, Denmark and Holland. ""Fireflies"" was featured as iTunes' ""Single of the Week"" and garnered 650,000 downloads. A music video for the song premiered in 2009 and was directed by Steve Hoover. ""Fireflies"" also reached the No. 1 spot in the UK and was the 20th most downloaded song of all time in the country. ""Vanilla Twilight"" was released on January 26, 2010 as the second single from the album. The song debuted at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, the same week ""Fireflies"" hit No. 1. The song eventually peaked at No. 72 on the chart. The music video for ""Vanilla Twilight"" was released on March 22, 2010 and features a cameo appearance from Shaquille O'Neal. The album's third and final single, ""Umbrella Beach"" was released on May 16, 2010 and peaked at No. 110 on the UK Singles Chart.

Owl City has toured with The Scene Aesthetic, Lights, John Mayer, Maroon 5, Brooke Waggoner and Relient K.

In 2010, Young revealed a new musical project known as Sky Sailing, which moved away from his usual electronica genre of music and introduced acoustic guitar and piano accompaniments into his work. The unrefined tracks were recorded in the summer of 2007 before he began making music as Owl City. His first album under this new project is entitled An Airplane Carried Me to Bed, and was released on July 13, 2010, via iTunes.
Young collaborated with English electronic musician Chicane and released the single ""Middledistancerunner"" on July 30, 2010, featuring Young on vocals.

Taylor Swift's song ""Enchanted"", released on October 25, 2010, was rumored to be about the time she met Adam Young. Young recorded his cover of ""Enchanted"" as a response, altering the lyrics to address Swift directly. He posted the recording on his website on February 13, 2011. He released a Christmas single called ""Peppermint Winter"" in November 2010.

Young discussed the concept in a making-of video posted on Owl City's VEVO account, ""The concept is basically about these two guys who are leaving Earth. Rather than it being this very dark post-apocalyptic vibe, it's very optimistic, and so it's like people are excited to leave earth."" The song, ""Galaxies"" was released as the second single from the album on April 19, 2011. Young stated that the song is about the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
""Deer in the Headlights"" was released on iTunes on May 23, 2011, as the first promotional single from the album.

Musical styles and influences
Owl City's music is described as indietronica and synth-pop and is often described as belonging to the electronic music genre. Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. As he is a vocal Christian, Young also incorporates his faith into some of his music. Young's faith is evident on the album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, especially in the song ""Galaxies"". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix he said, ""I feel like, if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime that I should probably be put in jail for.""
Owl City also has been compared to the Postal Service, often critically, for his combination of fuzzy synths, ironic lyrics, and use of female guest singers. Pitchfork goes to say that ""the surprise No. 1 single in the country, Owl City's 'Fireflies', jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst."" In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with The New York Times that Ocean Eyes is perhaps the ""next chapter"" after the Postal Service: ""The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until someone else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that's this record. Maybe that's this band.""

Progressive music,"Progressive music is music that attempts to expand existing stylistic boundaries associated with specific genres of music.  The word comes from the basic concept of ""progress"", which refers to advancements through accumulation, and is often deployed in the context of distinct genres, with progressive rock being the most notable example. Music that is deemed ""progressive"" usually synthesizes influences from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. It is rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, and may also be associated with auteur-stars and concept albums, considered traditional structures of the music industry.
As an art theory, the progressive approach falls between formalism and eclecticism. ""Formalism"" refers to a preoccupation with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and the autonomy of individual art works. Like formalism, ""eclecticism"" connotes a predilection toward style synthesis or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms, and cultural codes. In marketing, ""progressive"" is used to distinguish a product from ""commercial"" pop music.

Jazz
Progressive jazz is a form of big band that is more complex or experimental. It originated in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its ""progressive"" features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; ""They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried to tell me I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his.""
Progressive big band is a style of big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernist arrangements and more room to improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.

Pop and rock
Definitions
""Progressive rock"" is almost synonymous with ""art rock""; the latter is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences. Although a unidirectional English ""progressive"" style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967, progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes. With the arrival of a ""progressive"" label, the music was dubbed ""progressive pop"" before it was called ""progressive rock"". ""Progressive"" referred to the wide range of attempts to break with the standard pop music formula. A number of additional factors contributed to the label—lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of ""art"", some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th-century classical music, the album format overtook singles, and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.

Background
During the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word ""progressive"" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a ""progression"" from the last. In 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among rock musicians dramatically increased for bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Byrds who fused elements of composed (cultivated) music with the oral (vernacular) musical traditions of rock. Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signaling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the ""underground"" and the ""establishment"" for listening publics. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.
The music was developed immediately following a brief period in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word ""progressive"", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from ""commercial"" pop.Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between ""progressive"" pop and ""mass/chart"" pop, a separation which was ""also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class."" Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of ""progressive"" rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers ""above"" normal pop practice.

""Proto-prog"" is a retrospective label for the first wave of progressive rock musicians. The musicians that approached this genre harnessed modern classical and other genres usually outside of traditional rock influences, longer and more complicated compositions, interconnected songs as medley, and studio composition. Progressive rock itself evolved from psychedelic/acid rock music, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues. Critics assumed King Crimson's debut album In the Court of the Crimson King (1969) to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s proto-progressive rock exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallizing the music of earlier ""proto-progressive bands [...] into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style"". He distinguishes 1970s ""classic"" prog from late 1960s proto-prog by the conscious rejection of psychedelic rock elements, which proto-progressive bands continued to incorporate.

Post-progressive
""Post-progressive"" is a term invented to distinguish a type of rock music from the persistent ""progressive rock"" style associated with the 1970s. In the mid to late 1970s, progressive music was denigrated for its assumed pretentiousness, specifically the likes of Yes, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. According to musicologist John Covach, ""by the early 1980s, progressive rock was thought to be all but dead as a style, an idea reinforced by the fact that some of the principal progressive groups has developed a more commercial sound. [...] What went out of the music of these now ex-progressive groups [...] was any significant evocation of art music."" In the opinion of King Crimson's Robert Fripp, ""progressive"" music was an attitude, not a style. He believed that genuinely ""progressive"" music pushes stylistic and conceptual boundaries outwards through the appropriation of procedures from classical music or jazz, and that once ""progressive rock"" ceased to cover new ground – becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated – the genre's premise had ceased to be ""progressive"". 

A direct reaction to prog came in the form of the punk movement, which rejected classical traditions, virtuosity, and textural complexity. Post-punk, which author Doyle Green characterizes ""as a kind of 'progressive punk'"", was played by bands like Talking Heads, Pere Ubu, Public Image Ltd, and Joy Division. It differs from punk rock by balancing punk's energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. It was also majorly influenced from world music, especially African and Asian traditions. In the same period, new wave music was more sophisticated in production terms than some contemporaneous progressive music, but was largely perceived as simplistic, and thus had little overt appeal to art music or art-music practice. Musicologist Bill Martin writes; ""[Talking] Heads created a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well.""

Soul and funk
""Progressive soul"" is used by Martin to refer to a musical development in which many African-American recording artists by the 1970s were creating music in a manner similar to progressive rock. This development inspired greater musical diversity and sophistication, ambitious lyricism, and conceptual album-oriented approach in black pop. Among the musicians at its forefront were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton. According to Geoffrey Himes, ""the short-lived progressive-soul movement flourished"" from 1968 to 1973 and demonstrated ""adventurous rock guitar, socially conscious lyrics and classic R&B melody"". Similar to contemporaneous white prog musicians, progressive black musicians in the 1970s directed their creative control toward ideals of ""individualism, artistic progression and writing for posterity"", according to music academic Jay Keister, who notes that this pursuit sometimes conflicted with the collective political values of the Black Arts Movement.
Among the stylistic characteristics shared from progressive rock in black progressive music of this period were extended composition, diverse musical appropriation, and recording music intended for listening rather than dancing. Rather than the song-based extended compositions and suites of progressive white music, black counterparts in the 1970s generally unified an extended recording with an underlying rhythmic groove. Instrumental textures were altered in order to signify a change in section over an extended track's course. Examples of these characteristics include Funkadelic's ""Wars of Armageddon"" (1971) and Sun Ra's ""Space Is the Place"" (1973). Unlike the European art music appropriations used by white artists, progressive black music featured musical idioms from African and African-American music sources. However, some also borrowed elements from European American traditions to augment a song's lyrical idea. For example, Wonder added pleasant-sounding instrumental textures from a string section to ""Village Ghetto Land"" (1976), lending a sense of irony to an otherwise bleak critique of social ills in urban ghettos.

Electronic
""Progressive electronic"" is defined by AllMusic as a subgenre of new age music, and a style that ""thrives in more unfamiliar territory"" where the results are ""often dictated by the technology itself."" According to Allmusic, ""rather than sampling or synthesizing acoustic sounds to electronically replicate them"" producers of this music ""tend to mutate the original timbres, sometimes to an unrecognizable state."" Allmusic also states that, ""true artists in the genre also create their own sounds.""

Tangerine Dream's 1974 album Phaedra, recorded with a Moog sequencer, was described as ""an early masterpiece of progressive electronic music"" by Rolling Stone. In house music, a desire to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the interposition of prefixes like ""progressive"", ""tribal"", and ""intelligent"". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term ""progressive"" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed ""progressive"" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. By 1993, progressive house and trance music had emerged in dance clubs. ""Progressive house"" was an English style of house distinguished by long tracks, big riffs, mild dub inflections, and multitiered percussion. According to Simon Reynolds, the ""'progressive' seemed to signify not just its anti-cheese, nongirly credentials, but its severing of house's roots from gay black disco.""
In the mid-1990s, the lowercase movement, a reductive approach towards new digital technologies, was spearheaded by a number of so-called ""progressive electronica"" artists.

Criticism
Reynolds posited that ""the truly progressive edge in electronic music involves doing things that can't be physically achieved by human beings manipulating instruments in real-time."" He criticized terms like ""progressive"" and ""intelligent"", arguing that ""it's usually a sign that it's gearing up the media game as a prequel to buying into traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it's a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun."" Reynolds also identifies links between progressive rock and other electronic music genres, and that ""many post-rave genres bear an uncanny resemblance to progressive rock: conceptualism, auteur-geniuses, producers making music to impress other producers, [and] showboating virtuosity reborn as the 'science' of programming finesse.""

Hip hop
""Progressive rap"" has been used by academics to describe a certain type of hip hop music. Anthony B. Pinn regards it as a thematic subset alongside gangsta rap and ""status rap"", which expresses concerns about social status and mobility. While exploring existential crises and philosophical contradictions similar to gangsta rap, progressive rap, he says, ""seeks to address these concerns without intracommunal aggression and in terms of political and cultural education, providing an interpretation of American society and a constructive agenda (e.g. self respect, knowledge, pride, and unity) for the uplift of Black America"". He adds that works of the genre also utilize ""a more overt dialogue with and interpretation of Black religiosity"". In a corollary analysis, fellow academic Evelyn L. Parker says that progressive rap ""seeks to transform systems of injustice by transforming the perspective of their victims"" while demonstrating ""the clear prophetic voice reflecting the rage caused by the dehumanizing injustices that African Americans experience"".

Early works of progressive rap such as the 1982 Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song ""The Message"" and the music of Public Enemy featured expressions of anger about chaotic urban life. Other formative groups such as De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and Brand Nubian helped establish the genre's thematic mode. At the turn of the 2000s, Outkast and The Roots were among the few progressive-rap acts who ""ruminated on hip-hop's post-millennial direction"" and ""produced records in an avant-garde vein purposely intended to evolve the music"" while achieving commercial success, according to Miles Marshall Lewis. Kanye West, another influential artist in hip hop's progressive tradition, achieved even greater success with his opening trilogy of education-themed albums in the 2000s. His 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has also been associated with prog-rap due largely to its sampling of records from progressive rock as well as its ostentatious sensibilities.
The UK has also produced notable performers in progressive rap, including Gaika and Kojey Radical, who are credited by Vice in 2016 for working ""deliberately outside the confines of grime and traditional UK hip hop to create genuinely progressive rap that rivals the US for creativity, urgency, and importance, and portrays a much broader black British music landscape than you hear on the radio."" More recently, American studies and media scholar William Hoynes highlights the progressive rap of Kendrick Lamar as being in the tradition of African-American art and activism that operated ""both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture"".

R. Carlos Nakai,"Raymond Carlos Nakai (born April 16, 1946) is a Native American flutist of Navajo and Ute heritage. Nakai played brass instruments in high school and college, and auditioned for the Armed Forces School of Music after a two-year period in the United States Navy. He began playing a traditional Native American cedar flute after an accident left him unable to play the trumpet. Largely self-taught, he released his first album Changes in 1983, and afterward signed a contract with Canyon Records, who produced more than thirty of his albums in subsequent years. His music prominently features original compositions for the flute inspired by traditional Native American melodies. Nakai has collaborated with musicians William Eaton, Peter Kater, Philip Glass, Nawang Khechog, Paul Horn, and Keola Beamer. He has received 11 Grammy Award nominations for his albums.

Biography
Early life and education
Raymond Carlos Nakai was born in Flagstaff, Arizona on April 16, 1946, to a family of Navajo and Ute descent. His father Raymond Nakai served as the Chairman of the Navajo Nation from 1963 to 1970. He now resides in Tucson, Arizona. As a child he would audition tapes for a Navajo language radio show hosted by his parents; in doing so, he heard a recording of William Horn Cloud, a Lakota musician from the Pine Ridge Reservation, playing the flute. When he enrolled in a high school on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona, he sought to play the flute in the school band, but was assigned the cornet instead, which, he later said, he was less interested in.
He began studying at Northern Arizona University in 1966, where he played brass instruments in the marching band. As a second-year student, he was drafted into the United States Navy, and spent two years studying communications and electronics in Hawai'i and the south Pacific. He auditioned for the Royal Hawaiian Band, but was turned down as he was not Hawaiian himself. He continued to receive musical training while in the military. He returned to the Navajo reservation in 1971, where he had a difficult period; several of his classmates had been killed in the Vietnam War. He passed the highly competitive auditions for the Armed Forces School of Music, and was 28th on the waiting list for admission. Playing with the Armed Forces Band became impossible after an auto accident damaged his mouth, making it impossible to produce the correct embouchure to continue playing brass instruments.

Musical career
After his accident, Nakai had a brief struggle with drugs and alcohol. In 1972 he was given a traditional cedar flute, which he gradually taught himself to play, going on to purchase an instrument from Oliver William Jones, a flute maker from California who Nakai met while working as a vendor at a museum. Jones would continue to supply Nakai with flutes for several years. Nakai found it difficult to expand his repertoire due to the absence of recordings or scores for traditional flute music; he therefore began to learn vocal music, and adapted many traditional songs for the flute. He returned to Northern Arizona University to earn a Bachelor's Degree in 1979 and later earned a master's degree in American Indian studies from the University of Arizona. He taught graphic art at a high school until 1983; his wife also worked as a teacher at the time.
Nakai began recording his music on cassettes, and selling them on the Navajo Reservation. After a period of little success, he played his music during an exhibition at the Heard Museum, where a representative of Canyon Records bought one of his cassettes. His playing impressed the museum's administrators, who offered him a job; Nakai subsequently worked for the museum for three years. He recorded the album Changes in 1983, and sold it independently; soon afterward, he signed a contract with Canyon Records, who would release more than thirty of his recordings over the next decades. By 2016, Nakai had recorded more than thirty commercial albums with Canyon records and several more with other producers, and had sold more than 3.5 million records. These recordings included several collaborations, including with the Japanese folk ensemble Wind Travelin' Band, the Philadelphia Orchestra's Israeli cellist Udi Bar-David, guitarist William Eaton, American composer Philip Glass, Tibetan flutist Nawang Khechog, flutist Paul Horn, and slack key guitar player Keola Beamer.

Genre and style
Nakai's music prominently features improvisations on the Native American cedar flute. He also plays the eagle-bone whistle, and uses synthesizers, chanting, and sounds from nature. Although he occasionally plays arrangements of traditional melodies, most of his music attempts to ""[create] original compositions that capture the essence of his heritage in highly personalized ways."" Nakai states: ""I build upon the tribal context, while still retaining its essence. Much of what I do builds upon and expresses the environment and experience that I’m having at the moment."" His collaborations have included works produced with musicians of different genres, including jazz, western classical music, and traditional music from different parts of the world. Nakai also composed a few ""light-hearted"" orchestral works. Although his music has been popular among enthusiasts of New Age music, he has disagreed with that categorization.

Recognition and legacy
Many of Nakai's records have been critically and commercially successful. Two albums, Earth Spirit (1987) and Canyon Trilogy (1989), were certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Music review website AllMusic called Canyon Trilogy ""[elegant] in its simplicity"", and referred to Earth Spirit as ""an outstanding CD from a soulful man.""
Nakai's 1995 collaboration with William Eaton, Feather, Stone, and Light, topped the New Age music album charts for 13 weeks, and was listed as a Billboard Critic's choice. He has been nominated for the Grammy Award eleven times: first in 1993 for Ancestral Voices in the Best Traditional Folk Album category, and later eight times in the Best New Age Album category, and twice in the Best Native American Album category. He has been described as one of the ""most prolific and innovative artists"" within his genre.
Nakai developed a system of tablature notation, commonly known as Nakai tablature, that could be used to represent Native American music in a notation similar to that of Western classical music. It could be used across different flute types, as notes in it corresponded to intervals from the fundamental frequency of the flute, rather than to an absolute frequency.
Nakai was featured on the 1999 film Songkeepers, which depicted five Native American flute players — Nakai, Tom Mauchahty-Ware, Sonny Nevaquaya, Hawk Littlejohn, Kevin Locke — talking about their instruments and songs, and the role of the flute and its music in their tribes. Nakai's 1985 composition Cycles was used by the Martha Graham Dance Company in 1988 as the music for its ballet Nightchant. In 1993, Nakai played the flute as a soloist for the Phoenix Symphony's world premiere of a concerto for the ceder flute, composed by James DeMars.
In 2005, Nakai was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame. Nakai was awarded the Arizona Governor's Arts Award in 1992. He received an honorary doctorate from Northern Arizona University in 1994, and the NAUAA Dwight Patterson (1934) Alumnus of the Year Award in 2001. The Library of Congress has more than 30 of his recordings preserved in the American Folklife Center.

Discography
Nakai's first album was released in 1983 by Canyon Records. He has since released forty other albums through Canyon and appeared as a guest on other labels.

Rabbit in the Moon,"Rabbit in the Moon is an American electronic music group that formed in 1991. Their style draws from psychedelic trance, house music and breakbeat, along with other diverse influences.

History
Formed in 1992 in Tampa, Florida, the group consisted of performer/singer Bunny and producer David Christophere. 
After several singles released on Monk and David Christophere's Hallucination Recordings label under the name Anarch-E, their first success as producers came in 1993 with the release of the ""Phases of an Out of Body Experience"" single on Hardkiss Records.  As remixers, Rabbit in the Moon has reworked songs by artists such as Garbage (""Queer"" and ""Milk""), Tori Amos (""Precious Things""), Sarah McLachlan (""Fear"", ""Possession""), Orbital (""Are We Here?""), Smashing Pumpkins (""The End Is the Beginning Is the End""), Goldie (""Inner City Life""), White Zombie (""Blood, Milk and Sky"") and Delerium (""Euphoria"").
Rabbit in the Moon has also collaborated with Humate and in 1994 they released the Hemispheres E.P.
Throughout their career, Rabbit in the Moon toured extensively in the United States playing shows at venues and raves.
The Rabbit in the Moon Remixes Volume 2 CD came with a liner note stating that there was a new album to be released in summer of 2001. The album never materialized. Because of Monk's departure, questions were raised as to whether the band was breaking up, but this was not the case.

DJ Monk leaves
DJ Monk left the group in 2002. A new song called ""Time Bomb"" surfaced in 2003, with David Christophere and Bunny as the only producers on the track.
In 2005, they made the song ""Came and Conkered"", inspired by and featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 video game Conker: Live & Reloaded. They were asked by Nile Rodgers to create music for the Xbox remake of the game.
Early in 2007, a countdown to a new album appeared on the band's MySpace page, putting the release date in April 2007. The album was ultimately released on July 10, 2007. It features two discs: one, a collection of past singles and newer material in audio CD format; the other, a collection of music videos and live performances from various festivals and concerts in DVD format. The record is called ""Decade"", and was released on Contagious Musiq / Southbeat Records.
In 2008, on the second night of the Annual World DJ Festival in Seoul, South Korea, frontman Bunny was injured when a glass bottle thrown by someone in the crowd hit his left eye, lacerating his retina, lens, and skin, and severely damaging his vision. Friends and fans throughout the electronic dance music community rallied to raise money to help him pay for his medical expenses.
As of 2010, Rabbit in the Moon announced on their MySpace page that they were working on a new double album.
On March 27, 2010, Rabbit in the Moon performed at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami.  David Christophere was not seen at this show, fueling rumors he left the band and of an imminent band break up.  
Bunny has been performing in several countries under the title BUNNY or Bunny Live.
David Christophere produces music and DJ from his home base in Los Angeles.

Reunion
On August 31, 2013, the group played Firestone Live in Orlando, FL.
On December 16, 2015, Ultra Music Festival in Miami announced on their lineup of 2016 edition the appearance of Rabbit in the Moon. The group performed at Electric Daisy Carnival in Orlando in November, 2016.
The group played at Ultra Music Festival Miami  2017 and 2018. As well as Ultra Korea, Insomniac Countdown , Freaknight Seattle, and the great salt air Utah Das Energi festival.

Radio Massacre International,"Radio Massacre International is a trio of British musicians, Steve Dinsdale (keyboards and drums), Duncan Goddard (keyboards and bass), and Gary Houghton (guitar, synth). They specialize in improvisational experimental electronic music, utilising vintage synthesizers and sampled sounds alongside electric guitar. They are also exponents of the Mellotron keyboard. More recently, they have begun to incorporate bass guitar and drums by varying degrees in an attempt to stretch musical boundaries within the confines of a three-piece. Their music has been described alternatively as ambient music, space rock, Krautrock, New Age, Berlin School, and various other terms, although the band itself prefers the label ""organic music"". Points of reference include bands ranging from Tangerine Dream to ""Rabbit""-era Chas and Dave.

Name
The unusual name dates to the early 1980s, and the trio's early experiments with primitive sounds. The name was coined by Steve to describe cathartic sessions by the band, working away from traditional write/arrange/rehearse methods. Lacking anything but the most basic equipment, the band plugged keyboards and guitars straight into a cassette deck for a more abrasive sound than that achieved with the (mostly borrowed) equipment used in the making of their early recordings as DAS. Therefore, there is no deeper meaning in the name.
It was adopted as the main name for the band in 1990, as recording in the ""DAS"" style was wound up. There are 12 DAS ""albums"", although only the first was ever published (as a cassette album); some of the later titles feature other musicians and any plan to release these recordings would mean hunting down the participants to obtain clearance.

History
The band dates to the late 1970s, when Steve and Duncan went to the same school. They formed the band DAS with Gary and recorded 12 albums between 1979 and 1987, most of which were never released.
Steve, who is originally a drummer, went on to play in a couple of 'scene' bands after moving to London in 1988, while Duncan started to amass synthesizers, and recorded the first solo projects. When he finally found a space for him and Steve – who got disillusioned with the music business at that time – to work in, they recorded a first session in 1993, which was later released as Startide. Gary re-joined in 1994 with his guitar, and the band as it's known today was born.
Their first official release was the double CD Frozen North on Centaur in 1995. They also debuted Radio Massacre International as a live act at the Emma festival in Sheffield in the same year.
In 1996, they were invited to perform on MTV's Party Zone, making them probably the only band to play a live piece on the dance-orientated show that did not contain a single discernible beat. The same month, they were the first electronic artists to play at the famous Jodrell Bank observatory, in the shadow of the radio dish. This was later released as the humorously titled live CD Knutsford in May.
1997 saw them play at the famous (but now defunct) KLEMdag festival in Nijmegen, Netherlands, in front of the band's largest ever live audience. The year 2000 brought appearances at the Alfa Centauri festival in the Netherlands, and another visit to Jodrell Bank. The band's music was also featured in the BBC-TV programme ""Don’t Look Down"" about the 300 ft radio telescope.
The first Hampshire Jam festival of electronic music in Liphook in 2001 saw them appear together with other artists of the genre like Air Sculpture, Paul Nagle and Free System Project.
In November 2002, they played their first dates in the United States, at the ProgWest Festival in LA and at The Gatherings Concert Series in Philadelphia. Furthermore, they appeared twice live on radio, on Alien Air Music on KXLU in LA, and on Star's End on WXPN in Philadelphia. True to form, the band released a 2-CD collection documenting this tour (Solid States).
Further live events included the E-Live festival in Eindhoven, the Netherlands in late 2003,
and the Virtaa Arts Festival in Tapiola (nr Helsinki), Finland in early 2004. Manchester's The Night and Day Cafe witnessed a 2004 collaborative performance which saw RMI and Can luminary Damo Suzuki perform together for the first time.
A return visit to Philadelphia in 2004 at the invitation of Chuck Van Zyl resulted in a recording contract with USA label Cuneiform Records, for which the debut release was 2005's Emissaries, a double CD which also featured a full-colour comic-strip story by artist Matt Howarth.
Since 2003, they have given annual performances at the UK National Space Centre in Leicester, performing with fellow artist Ian Boddy as a guest of the band on the last of these occasions in March 2006. RMI then released the Septentrional CD on Boddy's DiN label, which was again characterised by a collaborative spirit, with Boddy treating and remixing the material.
In December 2006, they released the long-awaited 6-CD compilation Lost in Space, a career retrospective but containing entirely unreleased material from 1987 to 2003.
In September 2007, they released two CDs. The first, Rain Falls in Grey, the band describe in the sleeve notes as ""a way of saying goodbye and thanks to a genuine one off"", referring to Syd Barrett. The cover art for this release was drawn by Daevid Allen, famous as a member of the group Gong. The second release, Blacker, was on their own Northern Echo record label. The albums were launched with a rare UK show featuring album guest Martin Archer.
Once again they visited the East Coast of the US in November 2007, and played a mostly well-received series of radio sessions and live shows in a variety of contexts, augmented on occasions by Premik Russell Tubbs and Cyndee Lee Rule.
In February 2008, they completed recording of their first film soundtrack, entitled City 21, due for release in September 2008 by the Knossus Project.
In June 2008, they played NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA, their most high-profile appearance to date.
In October 2008, they played again at the E-Live festival in Eindhoven.
October 2009 saw their second appearance at the Hampshire Jam Festival in Liphook, Hampshire.
2019 saw the band win the prestigious Downe Arms quiz night competition donating the prize money to the village of Castelton's playground fund.

Radiohead,"Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. They comprise Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.
Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, ""Creep"", was a worldwide hit, and their popularity and critical standing rose with The Bends in 1995. Their third album, OK Computer (1997), is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music, with complex production and themes of modern alienation. Their fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the war on terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.
Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien have released solo albums. In 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.
By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: ""Creep"" (1992), ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" (1996), ""Paranoid Android"" (1997), ""Karma Police"" (1997), ""No Surprises"" (1998), ""Pyramid Song"" (2001), and ""There There"" (2003). ""Creep"" and ""Nude"" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

History
1985–1992: formation and first years
The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and the bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O'Brien and the drummer Philip Selway the year above. Colin's brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, was two years below Yorke and Colin, and the last to join. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. The band disliked the school's strict atmosphere—the headmaster once charged them for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday—and found solace in the music department. They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music. 

While each member contributed songs in the band's early period, Yorke emerged as the main songwriter. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: ""It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool."" At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section. Oxfordshire and the Thames Valley had an active independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive. On a Friday played their first gig in 1987, at Oxford's Jericho Tavern. 
On the strength of an early demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, but they decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. In 1987, all but Jonny had left Abingdon to attend university. On a Friday continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays, but did not perform for four years. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met Stanley Donwood, who later became Radiohead's cover artist.
In 1991, the band members regrouped in Oxford, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road. They recorded another demo, which attracted the attention of Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and the co-owner of Oxford's Courtyard Studios. Hufford and his business partner, Bryce Edge, attended a concert at the Jericho Tavern; impressed, they became On a Friday's managers. According to Hufford, at this point the band had ""all of the elements of Radiohead"", but with a rougher, punkier sound and faster tempos. At Courtyard Studios, On a Friday recorded the Manic Hedgehog demo tape, named after an Oxford record shop.
In late 1991, Colin happened to meet the EMI A&R representative Keith Wozencroft at a record shop and handed him a copy of the demo. Wozencroft was impressed and attended a performance. That November, On a Friday performed at the Jericho Tavern to an audience that included several A&R representatives. It was only their eighth gig, but they had attracted interest from several record companies. On 21 December, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI. At EMI's request, they changed their name; ""Radiohead"" was taken from the song ""Radio Head"" on the Talking Heads album True Stories (1986). Yorke said the name ""sums up all these things about receiving stuff ... It's about the way you take information in, the way you respond to the environment you're put in.""

1992–1994: ""Creep"", Pablo Honey and early success
Radiohead recorded their debut EP, Drill, with Hufford and Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. As it was difficult for major labels such as EMI to promote bands in the UK, where independent labels dominated the indie charts, Radiohead's managers planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK. Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with the US bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., were enlisted to produce Radiohead's debut album, recorded quickly in Oxford in 1992. With the release of their debut single, ""Creep"", that September, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as ""a lily-livered excuse for a rock band"", and ""Creep"" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 as ""too depressing"".

Radiohead released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in February 1993. It reached number 22 in the UK charts. ""Creep"" and its follow-up singles ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" and ""Stop Whispering"" failed to become hits, and ""Pop Is Dead"", a non-album single, also sold poorly. O'Brien later called it ""a hideous mistake"". Some critics compared Radiohead to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them ""Nirvana-lite"", and Pablo Honey inntially failed to make a critical or a commercial impact. The members of Radiohead expressed dissatisfaction with the album in later years.
In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. ""Creep"" had been played frequently on Israeli radio by the influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit there, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first show overseas. Around the same time, ""Creep"" began receiving airplay on US radio stations and reached number two on the US modern rock chart. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for ""Creep"" was in heavy rotation on MTV. It reached number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number seven on the UK Singles Chart when EMI rereleased it in September. To build on the success, Radiohead embarked on a US tour supporting Belly and PJ Harvey, followed by a European tour supporting James and Tears for Fears.

1994–1995: The Bends, critical recognition and growing fanbase
Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with the veteran Abbey Road Studios producer John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to match the success of ""Creep"". To break a deadlock, Radiohead toured Asia, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, troubled by his new fame, Yorke became disillusioned with being ""at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle"" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.
The My Iron Lung EP and single, released in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It was Radiohead's first collaboration with their future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer, and the artist Stanley Donwood, both of whom have worked with Radiohead on all their projects since. Though sales of My Iron Lung were low, it boosted Radiohead's credibility in alternative circles, creating commercial opportunity for their next album.
Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album, The Bends, by 1995, and released it that March. It was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from the three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than Pablo Honey. It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances. While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the Britpop scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in the UK with The Bends, as the singles ""Fake Plastic Trees"", ""High and Dry"", ""Just"", and ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" became chart successes. ""High and Dry"" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of ""Creep"". The Bends reached number 88 on the US album charts, and remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Jonny Greenwood later said The Bends was turning point for Radiohead: ""It started appearing in people's [best-of] polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band."" In later years, The Bends appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" at No. 111.
In 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Attention from famous fans such as the R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, along with distinctive music videos for ""Just"" and ""Street Spirit"", helped sustain Radiohead's popularity outside the UK. The night before a performance in Denver, Colorado, Radiohead's tour van was stolen, and with it their musical equipment. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a stripped-down acoustic set with rented instruments and several shows were cancelled. Their first live video, Live at the Astoria, was released in 1995.

1995–1998: OK Computer and critical acclaim
By late 1995, Radiohead had already recorded one song that would appear on their next record. ""Lucky"", released as a single to promote the War Child charity's The Help Album, was recorded in a brief session with Nigel Godrich, the young audio engineer who had assisted on The Bends and produced a 1996 B-side, ""Talk Show Host"", the song being featured in Baz Luhrmann's 1996 Romeo + Juliet. Radiohead decided to self-produce their next album with Godrich, and began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire. In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed recording not at a studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording in different rooms, and listening to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.
Radiohead released their third album, OK Computer, in May 1997. It found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant-garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone to call the album a ""stunning art-rock tour de force"". Radiohead denied being part of the progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, whose early 1970s work influenced Jonny Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's bestseller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), although Yorke said the album's lyrics were inspired by observing the ""speed"" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called ""end-of-the-millennium blues"" in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. According to the journalist Alex Ross, Radiohead had become ""the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation"" as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before. OK Computer received acclaim. Yorke said he was ""amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.""

OK Computer was Radiohead's first number-one UK chart debut, and brought them commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"" and ""No Surprises"" were released as singles, of which ""Karma Police"" was most successful internationally. OK Computer went on to become a staple of ""best-of"" British album lists. In the same year, Radiohead became one of the first bands in the world to have a website, and developed a devoted online following; within a few years, there were dozens of fansites devoted to them.
OK Computer was followed by the year-long Against Demons world tour, including Radiohead's first headline Glastonbury Festival performance in 1997. Despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. Grant Gee, the director of the ""No Surprises"" video, filmed the band on tour for the 1999 documentary Meeting People Is Easy. The film portrays the band's disaffection with the music industry and press, showing their burnout over the course of the tour. Since its release, OK Computer is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and the Generation X era, and one of the greatest albums in recording history.
In 1998, Radiohead performed at a Paris Amnesty International concert and the Tibetan Freedom Concert. In March, they and Godrich entered Abbey Road Studios to record a song for the 1998 film The Avengers, ""Man of War"", but were unsatisfied with the results and it went unreleased. Yorke described the period as a ""real low point""; he and O'Brien developed depression, and the band came close to splitting up.

1998–2001: Kid A, Amnesiac and change in sound
In early 1999, Radiohead began work on their next album. Although the success of OK Computer meant there was no longer pressure from their record label, tensions were high. Band members had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke suffered from writer's block, influencing him toward more abstract, fragmented songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their new studio in Oxford. O'Brien kept an online diary of their progress. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.
Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A, was released in October 2000. A departure from OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where it became the first Radiohead album to debut atop the Billboard chart and the first US number-one album by any UK act since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of OK Computer. Although Radiohead released no singles from Kid A, promos of ""Optimistic"" and ""Idioteque"" received radio play, and a series of ""blips"", short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released free online. Inspired by Naomi Klein's anti-globalisation book No Logo, Radiohead continued a 2000 tour of Europe in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted Kid A with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.

Kid A received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some British critics saw Kid A as a ""commercial suicide note"" and ""intentionally difficult"", and longed for a return to Radiohead's earlier style. Fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, many saw it as the band's best work. Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew expectations, saying: ""We're not trying to be difficult ... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people ... What we're doing isn't that radical."" The album was ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times named it the best album of the decade.
Radiohead's fifth album, Amnesiac, was released in May 2001. It comprised additional tracks from the Kid A sessions, including ""Life in a Glasshouse"", featuring the Humphrey Lyttelton Band. Radiohead stressed that they saw Amnesiac not as a collection of B-sides or outtakes from Kid A but an album in its own right. It topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number two in the US, and was nominated for a Grammy Award and the Mercury Music Prize. Radiohead released ""Pyramid Song"" and ""Knives Out"" as singles, their first since 1998. Radiohead began a North American tour, their first there in three years, in June 2001. With a string of sold-out dates, The Observer described it as ""the most sweeping conquest of America by a British group"" since Beatlemania, succeeding where bands such as Oasis had failed. Recordings from the Kid A and Amnesiac tours were released on I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings in November 2001.

2002–2006: Hail to the Thief and solo work
In July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of new songs. For their next album, they sought to explore the tension between human and machine-generated music and capture a more immediate, live sound. They and Godrich recorded most of the material in two weeks at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles. The band described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac. Radiohead also composed music for ""Split Sides"", a dance piece by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which debuted in October 2003 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief, was released in June 2003. Its lyrics were influenced by what Yorke called ""the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity"" following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. The album was promoted with a website, radiohead.tv, where short films, music videos, and studio webcasts were streamed. Hail to the Thief debuted at number one in the UK and number three on the Billboard chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The singles ""There There"", ""Go to Sleep"" and ""2 + 2 = 5"" achieved heavy circulation on modern rock radio. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for Best Alternative Album, and Godrich and the engineer Darrell Thorp received the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album. In May 2003, Radiohead embarked on a world tour and headlined Glastonbury Festival for the second time. The tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the Coachella Festival in California. A compilation of Hail to the Thief B-sides, remixes and live performances, Com Lag (2plus2isfive), was released in April 2004.

Hail to the Thief was Radiohead's final album with EMI; in 2006, The New York Times described Radiohead as ""by far the world's most popular unsigned band"". Following the Hail to the Thief tour, Radiohead went on hiatus to spend time with their families and work on solo projects. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the Band Aid 20 charity single ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", produced by Godrich. Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations with the director Paul Thomas Anderson. In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, The Eraser, comprising mainly electronic music. He stressed it was made with the band's blessing, and that Radiohead were not breaking up. Jonny Greenwood said: ""He had to get this stuff out, and everyone was happy [for Yorke to make it] ... He'd go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus."" Selway and Jonny Greenwood appeared in the 2005 film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as members of the fictional band the Weird Sisters.

2006–2009: departure from EMI, In Rainbows, and ""pay what you want""
Radiohead began work on their seventh album in February 2005. Instead of involving Godrich, Radiohead hired the producer Spike Stent, but the collaboration was unsuccessful. In September 2005, Radiohead contributed ""I Want None of This"", a piano dirge, for the War Child charity album Help: A Day in the Life. The album was sold online, with ""I Want None of This"" the most downloaded track, though it was not released as a single. In late 2006, after touring Europe and North America with new material, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich and resumed work in London, Oxford and rural Somerset, England. Recording ended in June 2007 and the recordings were mastered the following month.
In 2007, EMI was acquired by the private equity firm Terra Firma. Radiohead were critical of the new management, and no new deal was agreed. The Independent reported that EMI had offered Radiohead a £3 million advance, but had refused to relinquish rights to the band's back catalogue. An EMI spokesman stated that Radiohead had demanded ""an extraordinary amount of money"". Radiohead's management and Yorke released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance, but had instead wanted control over their back catalogue.
Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows, on their website on 10 October 2007 as a download, for any amount users wanted, including £0. The landmark pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and created debate about the implications for the music industry. Media reaction was positive, and Radiohead were praised for finding new ways to connect with fans. However, it drew criticism from musicians such as Lily Allen and Kim Gordon, who felt it undercut less successful acts.
In Rainbows was downloaded an estimated 1.2 million times on the day of release. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the ""regulated playlists"" and ""straitened formats"" of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release. A special ""discbox"" edition of In Rainbows, containing the record on vinyl, a book of artwork, and a CD of extra songs, was also sold from Radiohead's website.
The retail version of In Rainbows was released in the UK in late December 2007 on XL Recordings and in North America in January 2008 on TBD Records, reaching number one in the UK and in the US. The success was Radiohead's highest chart placement in the US since Kid A. It became their fifth UK number-one album and sold more than three million copies in one year. The album received acclaim for its more accessible sound and personal lyrics. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and won the 2009 Grammy awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. It was nominated for five other Grammy awards, including Radiohead's third nomination for Album of the Year. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed ""15 Step"" with the University of Southern California Marching Band at the televised award show.

The first single from In Rainbows, ""Jigsaw Falling into Place"", was released in January 2008, followed by ""Nude"" in March, which debuted at number 37 in the Billboard Hot 100; it was Radiohead's first song to enter the chart since ""High and Dry"" (1995) and their first US top 40 since ""Creep"". In July, Radiohead released a digitally shot video for ""House of Cards"". Radiohead held remix competitions for ""Nude"" and ""Reckoner"", releasing the separated stems for fans to remix. In April 2008, Radiohead launched W.A.S.T.E. Central, a social networking service for Radiohead fans. In May, VH1 broadcast In Rainbows – From the Basement, a special episode of the music television show From the Basement in which Radiohead performed songs from In Rainbows. It was released on iTunes in June. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.
Days after Radiohead signed to XL, EMI announced a box set of Radiohead material recorded before In Rainbows, released in the same week as the In Rainbows special edition. Commentators including the Guardian saw the move as retaliation for the band choosing not to re-sign with EMI. In June 2008, EMI released a greatest hits album, Radiohead: The Best Of. It was made without Radiohead's involvement and contains only songs recorded under their contract with EMI. Yorke was critical of the release, calling it a ""wasted opportunity"". In 2009, EMI reissued Radiohead's back catalogue in expanded editions.

2009–2010: singles and side projects
As social media expanded around the turn of the decade, Radiohead gradually withdrew their public presence, with no promotional interviews or tours to promote new releases. Pitchfork wrote that around this time Radiohead's ""popularity became increasingly untethered from the typical formalities of record promotion, placing them on the same level as Beyoncé and Kanye West"".
In May 2009, Radiohead began new recording sessions with Godrich. In August, they released ""Harry Patch (In Memory Of)"", a tribute song to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in World War I, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The song has no conventional rock instrumentation, and instead comprises Yorke's vocals and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood. Later that month, another new song, ""These Are My Twisted Words"", featuring krautrock-like drumming and guitars, was leaked via torrent, possibly by Radiohead. It was released as a free download on the Radiohead website the following week. Commentators saw the releases as part of Radiohead's new unpredictable release strategy, without the need for traditional marketing.
In 2009, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform his solo material, with musicians including Godrich and the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. They played eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead played their only full concert of the year in the Los Angeles Henry Fonda Theater as a benefit for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO's 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. That December, a fan-made video of the performance, Radiohead for Haiti, was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead's support and a ""pay-what-you-want"" link to donate to Oxfam. Radiohead also released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague performance for use in a fan-made concert video, Live in Praha. The videos were described as examples of Radiohead's openness to fans and positivity toward non-commercial internet distribution.
In June 2010, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing Eraser and Radiohead songs. Selway released his debut solo album, Familial, in August. Pitchfork described it as a collection of ""hushed"" folk songs in the tradition of Nick Drake, with Selway on guitar and vocals.

2011–2012: The King of Limbs
Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs, on 18 February 2011 as a download from their website. Following the protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of In Rainbows, Radiohead developed The King of Limbs by sampling and looping their recordings with turntables. It was followed by a retail release in March through XL, and a special ""newspaper album"" edition in May. 
The King of Limbs sold an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 copies through Radiohead's website. The retail edition debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 and number seven on the UK Albums Chart. It was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards. Two tracks not included on The King of Limbs, ""Supercollider"" and ""The Butcher"", were released as a double A-side single for Record Store Day in April. A compilation of King of Limbs remixes by various artists, TKOL RMX 1234567, was released in September.
To perform the rhythmically complex King of Limbs material live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, who had worked with Portishead and Get the Blessing. In June, Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, performing songs from The King of Limbs for the first time. With Deamer, Radiohead recorded The King of Limbs: Live from the Basement, released online in August 2011. It was also broadcast by international BBC channels and released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2012. The performance included two new songs, ""The Daily Mail"" and ""Staircase"", released as a double A-side download single in December 2011. In February 2012, Radiohead began their first extended North American tour in four years, including dates in the United States, Canada and Mexico. On tour, they recorded material at Jack White's studio Third Man Records, but discarded the recordings.
On 16 June 2012, an hour before gates were due to open at Toronto's Downsview Park for the final concert of Radiohead's North American tour, the roof of the venue's temporary stage collapsed, killing the drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three other members of Radiohead's road crew. After rescheduling the tour, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson at their next concert, in Nîmes, France, in July. In June 2013, Live Nation Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. In September 2017, after several delays, the case was dropped under the Jordan ruling, which sets strict time limits on trials. Radiohead released a statement condemning the decision. A 2019 inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.

2013–2014: side projects and move to XL
After the King of Limbs tour, the band members worked on further side projects. In February 2013, Yorke and Godrich's band, Atoms for Peace, released an album, Amok. The pair made headlines that year for their criticism of the free music streaming service Spotify. Yorke accused Spotify of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own ""direct connections"" with audiences instead.
In February 2014, Radiohead released an app, Polyfauna, a collaboration with the British digital arts studio Universal Everything, with music and imagery from The King of Limbs. In May, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to The Panic Office, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia. Yorke and Selway released their solo albums Tomorrow's Modern Boxes and Weatherhouse in late 2014. Jonny Greenwood scored his third Anderson film, Inherent Vice; it features a version of an unreleased Radiohead song, ""Spooks"", performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass. Junun, a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released in November 2015, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson.
In April 2016, Radiohead's back catalogue was acquired by XL Recordings, which had released the retail editions of In Rainbows and The King of Limbs and most of Yorke's solo work. XL reissued Radiohead's back catalogue on vinyl in May 2016.

2015–2016: A Moon Shaped Pool
Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014. In 2015, they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich's father and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died from cancer in 2016. Work was interrupted when Radiohead were commissioned to write the theme for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. After their song, ""Spectre"", was rejected, Radiohead released it on the audio streaming site SoundCloud on Christmas Day 2015.
Radiohead's ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released in May 2016 on Radiohead's website and online music stores, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles ""Burn the Witch"" and ""Daydreaming"", the latter directed by Anderson. The album includes several songs written years earlier, including ""True Love Waits"", and strings and choral vocals performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. It became Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in Mercury history, and it was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for ""Burn the Witch"") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of the year.

In 2016, 2017 and 2018, Radiohead toured Europe, Japan, and North and South America, including headline shows at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. They were joined again by Deamer.  The tours included a performance in Tel Aviv in July 2017, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. The performance was criticised by artists including Roger Waters and Ken Loach, and a petition urging Radiohead to cancel it was signed by more than 50 prominent figures. Yorke responded in a statement: ""Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.""

2017–2020: OKNOTOK and MiniDiscs [Hacked]
In June 2017, Radiohead released a 20th-anniversary OK Computer reissue, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, comprising a remastered version of the album, B-sides, and previously unreleased material. Radiohead promoted the reissue with music videos for the bonus tracks ""I Promise"", ""Man of War"" and ""Lift"". OKNOTOK debuted at number two on the UK Album Chart, boosted by Radiohead's televised Glastonbury performance that week, and reached number 23 on the US Billboard 200. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a benefit concert in Le Marche, Italy, in August 2017 following the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake. In September, the nature documentary series Blue Planet II premiered featuring a new version of the King of Limbs track ""Bloom"", created with the composer Hans Zimmer.
Radiohead were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, their first year of eligibility. They were nominated again in 2018 and inducted the following March. Though Jonny Greenwood and Yorke were uninterested in the event, Selway and O'Brien attended and made speeches. The singer David Byrne, one of Radiohead's formative influences, gave a speech praising Radiohead's musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the whole music industry.
In June 2019, several hours of recordings made by Radiohead during the OK Computer period leaked online. In response, Radiohead made the recordings available to purchase online as MiniDiscs [Hacked], with all proceeds to the environmentalist group Extinction Rebellion. In December, Radiohead made their discography available free on YouTube. The following January, they launched the Radiohead Public Library, an online archive of their work, including music videos, live performances, artwork and the 1998 documentary Meeting People Is Easy. Radiohead suspended their online content for Blackout Tuesday on 2 June, protesting racism and police brutality.
In 2017, Selway released his third solo work, the soundtrack to the film Let Me Go. Jonny Greenwood was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his fifth collaboration with Anderson, Phantom Thread (2017), and scored his second film by Lynne Ramsay, You Were Never Really Here (2018). Yorke released his first feature film soundtrack, Suspiria (2018), and his third solo album, Anima (2019), backed by a short film directed by Anderson. In 2020, O'Brien released his debut solo album, Earth, under the moniker EOB. He had been writing songs for years, but felt they had a ""distinct energy"" that would be lost with Radiohead.

2021–present: Kid A Mnesia, the Smile and side projects
Radiohead abandoned plans to tour in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November, they released Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material. It was promoted with download singles and videos for the previously unreleased tracks ""If You Say the Word"" and ""Follow Me Around"". Plans for an art installation based on the albums were cancelled due to logistical problems and the pandemic. Instead, Radiohead created a free digital experience, Kid A Mnesia Exhibition, for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.
In a livestream event held by Glastonbury Festival in May 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with the drummer Tom Skinner. Greenwood said the project was a way to work with Yorke during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis described the Smile as a ""more skeletal and knottier version of Radiohead"", with unusual time signatures, complex riffs and ""hard-driving"" motorik psychedelia. In May 2022, the Smile released their debut album, A Light for Attracting Attention, to acclaim. The Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal wrote that it was ""instantly, unmistakably the best album yet by a Radiohead side project"". The Smile toured internationally between 2022 and 2024. Their second album, Wall of Eyes, was released in January 2024.
Colin Greenwood toured Australia in 2022 as part of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's band. He began a tour with Cave in September 2023 and performed on his 2024 album Wild God. Selway released his third solo album, Strange Dance, in February 2023. Jarak Qaribak, an album by Jonny Greenwood and the Israeli rock musician Dudu Tassa, was released in June 2023. Yorke's second film soundtrack, Confidenza, was released in April 2024. Selway said it was healthy for the Radiohead members to work with other musicians and that all the projects came under the Radiohead ""umbrella"", and that Radiohead ""still very much exists"".

Style
Radiohead's musical style has been described as art rock, alternative rock, electronica, experimental rock, progressive rock, grunge, art pop, and electronic rock. Critics found elements of grunge in their first album, Pablo Honey. Their second album, The Bends, is sometimes described as Britpop, though Radiohead disliked the movement, seeing it as a ""backwards-looking"" pastiche. Many Radiohead songs use pivot notes and pedal points, creating ""looser, roomier"" harmonies and a ""bittersweet, doomy"" feeling.
O'Brien said Radiohead were hesitant to create ""epic"" music, which they felt had negative associations of stadium rock. However, he conceded that ""epic is also about beauty, like a majestic view"", and gave ""Weird Fishes/Arpeggi"" as an example of a song that was ""obviously epic in scope"".
Jonny Greenwood said Radiohead strive to find a middle ground between their experimental influences and straightforward rock music, and were driven by a desire not to repeat themselves rather than to be ""experimental"". The drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said Radiohead do not see themselves as a rock band and that their methodology is closer to jazz: ""They deliberately try to avoid cliché and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality.""

Songwriting
Though Yorke acts as Radiohead's director, all the members have a role in arrangement. In 2004, Yorke said that while his power was once ""absolutely unbalanced"" and he would ""subvert everybody else's power at all costs"", later albums had been more democratic. He apologised to his bandmates for his earlier ""control freak"" behaviour. O'Brien said that no member was replaceable and each was comfortable with their position in the band.
Radiohead songs usually begin as a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the rest of the band develop their parts. Whereas Yorke does not read sheet music, Greenwood is trained in music theory. In Pitchfork, Ryan Dombal wrote that ""the duo's left brain-right brain dynamic has proven to be one of the most adventurous in rock history"". While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units.
Radiohead often attempt several approaches to songs, and may develop them over years. For example, Radiohead first performed ""True Love Waits"" in 1995 before releasing it in a different arrangement on A Moon Shaped Pool in 2016. Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as ""just a kind of an arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song"", be it a cello or a laptop.
The Kid A and Amnesiac sessions brought a change in Radiohead's music and working methods. Since their shift from conventional rock instrumentation, the members have gained flexibility and often switch instruments. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, Jonny Greenwood played ondes Martenot, Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway worked with drum machines and digital manipulation.

Influences
Among Radiohead's earliest influences were Queen, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd and Elvis Costello, post-punk acts such as Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Magazine, and significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as R.E.M., U2, the Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth. Jonny Greenwood named the Magazine guitarist John McGeoch his biggest guitar influence. By the mid-1990s, Radiohead were adopting recording methods from hip hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ Shadow, and became interested in using computers to generate sounds. Other influences include the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector's ""wall of sound"" production.
Radiohead cited 60s and 70s jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Alice Coltrane as influences. According to Jonny Greenwood, ""We bring in our favourite jazz albums, and say: we want to do this. And we enjoy the sound of our failing!"" He likened their jazz influence to 1950s English bands imitating American blues records.

The electronic music of Kid A and Amnesiac was inspired by Yorke's admiration for Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin. In 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. Kid A also samples early computer music. 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu! were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th-century classical music also had a role, citing the influence of the composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen. Since the recording of Kid A, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen. While recording In Rainbows, Radiohead mentioned rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including Björk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock. In 2011, Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to make ""experimental music"", saying they were ""constantly absorbing music"" and that a variety of musicians are always influencing them.

Themes and lyrics
Yorke is Radiohead's lyricist. Though his early lyrics were personal, from Kid A he experimented with cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. He does not write biographically, saying he instead writes ""spasmodic"" lyrics based on imagery and taken from external sources such as television. He deliberately uses cliches, idioms and other common expressions, suggesting ""a mind consumed by meaningless data"". The New Republic writer Ryan Kearney speculated that Yorke's use of common expressions, which he described as ""Radioheadisms"", was an attempt ""to sap our common tongue of meaning and expose the vapidity of everyday discourse"".
According to Yorke, many of his lyrics are motivated by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns and written as ""a constant response to doublethink"". Pitchfork wrote that Yorke's lyrics on A Moon Shaped Pool were less cynical, conveying wonder and amazement. Yorke dismissed accusations that Radiohead make ""depressing"" music, saying in 2004: ""Depressing music to me is just shit music. It's like air freshener – just a nasty little poison in the air.""

Legacy and influence
Radiohead are cited as one of the foremost rock bands of the 21st century. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums. Their 90s albums The Bends and OK Computer influenced a generation of British acts, including Coldplay, Keane, James Blunt and Travis.  Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with expanding alternative rock.
According to the AllMusic journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in the early 21st century, Radiohead became ""a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock"", succeeding David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Talking Heads. In 2001, Johnny Marr, the guitarist for one of Radiohead's early influences, the Smiths, said that Radiohead was the act that had ""come closest to the genuine influence of the Smiths"".
In 2003, the Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote that Radiohead were ""the only youngish band standing that combines critical consensus with the ability to fill a venue larger than the Hammerstein Ballroom"". Gavin Haynes of NME described Radiohead in 2014 as ""our generation's Beatles"". In 2020, the academic Daphne Brooks described Radiohead as ""the blackest white rock band to emerge over the past 30 years"", citing their black jazz influences, influence on black artists, and their ""introspective other worlds"", which parallel the work of radical black artists.

Industry
Kid A is credited for pioneering the use of the internet to stream and promote music. The pay-what-you-want release for In Rainbows is credited as a major step for music distribution. Forbes wrote that it ""helped forge the template for unconventional album releases in the internet age"", ahead of artists such as Beyoncé and Drake. Speaking at Radiohead's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, the Talking Heads singer David Byrne, an early influence on Radiohead, praised their musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the entire music industry.

Accolades
Radiohead's work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In a 2004 list composed by 55 musicians, writers and industry executives, Rolling Stone named Radiohead 73rd-greatest artist of all time. They have been listed among the greatest bands of all time by Spin (15th) and among the greatest artists by VH1 (29th). They were also named the third-best British band in history by Harry Fletcher of the Evening Standard.
Radiohead are the most nominated act for the Mercury Prize, with five nominated albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted Radiohead the second-best artist of the 2000s, behind Green Day. In 2021, Pitchfork readers voted three Radiohead albums among the ten greatest albums of the previous 25 years, including Kid A at number one. Jonny Greenwood and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's lists of the best guitarists and Yorke in its lists of the greatest singers.

Collaborators
Nigel Godrich first worked with Radiohead as an audio engineer on their second album, The Bends. He has produced all their studio albums since their third album, OK Computer. He also plays Chieftain Mews, a long-running character who appears in Radiohead's promotional material. Godrich has been dubbed the band's ""sixth member"", an allusion to George Martin being called the ""Fifth Beatle"". In 2016, Godrich said: ""I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they'd have to start again.""
The graphic artist Stanley Donwood met Yorke when they were art students. Together, they have produced all of Radiohead's album covers and visual artwork since 1994. Donwood works in the studio with the band as they record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. He and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for the special edition of Amnesiac packaged as a library book.
Since Radiohead's formation, Andi Watson has been Radiohead's lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of their live concerts. Peter ""Plank"" Clements has worked with Radiohead since before The Bends, overseeing the technical management of studio recordings and live performances. Jim Warren has been Radiohead's live sound engineer since their first tour in 1992, and recorded early tracks including ""High and Dry"" and ""Pop Is Dead"". The drummer Clive Deamer was enlisted in 2011 to help perform the complex rhythms of The King of Limbs, and has performed and recorded with Radiohead since. Paul Thomas Anderson has directed several music videos for Yorke and Radiohead, and has collaborated with Jonny Greenwood on several film scores and the 2015 documentary Junun. Radiohead are managed by Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge of Courtyard Management. Hufford produced their first release, the Drill EP, and co-produced their first album, Pablo Honey.

Song catalogue
Radiohead recorded their first six albums under contract with Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI. The contract ended with the release of Hail to the Thief in 2003. They did not renew the contract for their next album, In Rainbows, as EMI would not give them control over their back catalogue and they did not trust the new owner, Guy Hands. Radiohead have self-released their subsequent work, with retail editions released by XL Recordings. In October 2015, Radiohead sued Parlophone for deductions made from downloads of their back catalogue.
In September 2012, EMI was bought by Universal Music. The European Commission approved the deal on the condition that Universal Music divest Parlophone, which controlled the Radiohead records. In February 2013, Parlophone, along with Radiohead's back catalogue, was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). As a condition of the purchase, WMG made an agreement with the Merlin Network and the trade group Impala to divest 30% of the Parlophone catalogues to independent labels, with artist approval. As a result, in April 2016, WMG transferred Radiohead's back catalogue to XL. The Best Of and the EMI reissues released in 2008 without Radiohead's approval were removed from streaming services.

BBC Interview with Stanley Donwood and Thom Yorke about artistic collaboration for Radiohead"
Rafael Anton Irisarri,"Rafael Anton Irisarri is an American composer, multi-instrumentalist, producer and mastering engineer based in New York. He is predominantly associated with post-minimalist, drone and electronic music. Irisarri is also known for being the main member of electronic music/shoegaze act The Sight Below, and signed to American label Ghostly International.

Influences
Irisarri is influenced by classical composers like Mahler, Satie, Debussy, and Wagner as well as contemporary musicians like Kevin Shields, Robin Guthrie, and Harold Budd. He also cites French existentialist philosopher Albert Camus and Uruguayan short story writer Horacio Quiroga as influences, and lists Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry as one of his all-time favorite books. He considers filmmakers David Lynch, Jan Švankmajer, Werner Herzog, and Julio Medem as continuous sources of inspiration. 
In a radio interview with the ABC in Sydney, Irisarri goes into further detail, describing to Quiet Space radio host Paul Gough the process behind The North Bend as inspired by ""this region (American Pacific Northwest), and not just with the fairly obvious 'rainy, gloomy skies' clichés, but more in the folk, cultural traditions and pop-culture references (think of David Lynch and his television-defining narrative Twin Peaks). They sort of helped me create an audio postcard of this beautiful area of the United States.""

Live performances
Irisarri travels frequently to perform live throughout Europe, North America, Australia and the Middle East. Highlights include concerts at Barcelona's Sónar, Detroit's DEMF, Montreal's MUTEK, and Kraków's Unsound. Aside from electronic music festivals, Irisarri has presented his works at multidisciplinary arts events, including Milan's prestigious MITO SettembreMusica festival and Israel Festival in Jerusalem.
In his live performances, Irisarri utilizes real-time signal processing, chaining together a series of custom-made looping software to achieve the textural density of his recorded works and favors improvised performances. This characteristic has earned Irisarri recognition from peers like Pantha Du Prince.

In December 2010, Irisarri released, through his Bandcamp store, a collection of live recordings performed at selected cities worldwide.

Collaborations
In the studio, Irisarri has worked extensively with Simon Scott, Tiny Vipers, Benoît Pioulard, Goldmund and remixed School of Seven Bells, Balmorhea, Detroit's Echospace, and Germany's Pantha Du Prince. Live, he has collaborated with Australian artist and Room40 label curator Lawrence English, Portland's Grouper, and Italian electro-acoustic composer Andrea Belfi.
In 2010, Irisarri collaborated twice with Austrian guitarist Fennesz, performing together live at Interferenze Festival in Italy and later at Decibel Festival in Seattle.
In May 2010, Irisarri traveled to Jerusalem to collaborate with Koen Holtkamp, Greg Davis, Ido Govrin, Ran Slavin and Yair Etziony in a two-day audiovisual performance piece titled Dissolving Localities, which explored the city's diverse cultures and unique sights and sounds. The project was commissioned as part of Israel Festival.
On January 21, 2011, Irisarri and Benoît Pioulard released a cover version of Broadcast's ""Until Then"" (from the band's 2000 album The Noise Made by People), as a tribute to Trish Keenan. Later that year, the collaboration spawned into a full, new project, called Orcas. Their debut album was released in April 2012 on Morr Music.
As a media artist, Irisarri has prepared, created and performed live video for Fennesz, Lusine, Simon Scott, Solvent, and The Sight Below.

He attended Qala primary school, then the Lyceum in Victoria, Gozo. He then moved to the United States and continued his studies in New York, where he settled permanently. By the age of 20 he had several poems published in anthologies in London and New York City.

History
Writing
Buttigieg is best known for Pastorale (1978), Poeticus I & II (1986) and (1992), and the first book he wrote in his late teens, Wizard's Spider Mystic Glider, (1989) which are written in a classical style; he received criticism when he later introduced a more modern style in his experiments and improvisational poetry. In the last few years he returned to his earlier style in works like The Wisdom of Stones (2002), Remnants from the Book of Time (2002), and The Procession (1999). Although for the last 25 years Buttigieg has been writing only in English and very little in his native Maltese, his subject matter still includes a great deal of influence from his native Malta.

Music
At the age of ten Buttigieg became interested in music when he started to sing Latin hymns on the gallery of the grand pipe organ at St Joseph's church. He was also attracted to pieces of metal of various sizes, weights and alloys as well as short wave radios; he thought the combination of these found instruments are uniquely musical that could be used as effects. He later learned the guitar and started to write songs for his first rock improvisational band.

With Cykx
Buttigieg started his professional musical career in New York and Philadelphia where he fronted the six piece glam/rock band Cykx. His catchy tunes mixed with his lyrical poetry produced two top ten pop hits in the mid-seventies. At the same time synthesizers and computers and electronic music experiments on tape were becoming more interesting to Buttigieg than bandmates who could never agree on anything. Soon the band was defunct and a new project band started: Ray Buttigieg/Cykx, Cykx being the computer that replaced the members of the band. The pop or rock compositions now became explorations and experiments in sound. Compucircuit 0.008 m/s (1981) and Mechanism of Thought (1984) were both groundbreaking albums.
Buttigieg believed that electronic synthesisers were a third ""high"" in music, the first and second being acoustic and electric instruments.

Solo work
Buttigieg embarked on a solo career when he set eyes on his first keyboard, a Mellotron. He was involved in multiple projects at the same time while being involved in solo major works and other series concepts like Earth noise and Sound Science Series in the 70s and The Symphonic Poems, Music for and Diary of an Earthling series in the 80s. Film and video work were also becoming an interesting avenue to combine visuals and poetry, and as the music soundtrack that would define the visuals all done under the same roof. He continued his career by producing some influential and lush albums like Sound of Transformation – Symphonic Poem No.1 (1982), Quantum Mechanics (1985), Music for Movies (1986), Codes (1987) and Musical Instincts of Nature.

Producing records and collaborating
Since the very beginning of his career in the mid-70s, Buttigieg has been sought after for creative guidance, collaborating, producing and as the idea man. His string of credits include in Rebellion, Process and After Thought in the 80s, and in the 90s co-wrote songs and produced bands like Novi Mystici, Prosper Falls, Selfish like Magnets and Noise Button. In the last few years of the new millennium Buttigieg wrote songs for other artists in the genres of popular music/pop song, gothic format and has gone aggressively into everything electronic whether it is electronica, ambient, new age or electronic, producing and collaborating with bands like FTSG, Dyr3, System 6, Desire becomes Being and Circa 2000 AD for Cykxincorp and Standing Stone Recording Company record labels, part of Cykxincorp Group of Companies.

Ray Lynch,"Raymond Lynch (born July 3, 1943) is an American guitarist, lutenist, keyboardist, and composer. He began his musical career in 1967 by performing in The Renaissance Quartet in New York City before leaving in 1974 and giving up his musical career. During his hiatus, Lynch studied with his spiritual teacher, Adi Da, who would ultimately encourage him to return to music.  Lynch released five albums during the 1980s and 1990s, including The Sky of Mind, Deep Breakfast, No Blue Thing, and Nothing Above My Shoulders but the Evening. Initially producing his music independently, Lynch eventually worked with Music West. After Lynch sued and left the company, Lynch joined Windham Hill in 1992 before retiring in 2000. Lynch has won three Billboard awards.

Early life
Lynch was born on July 3, 1943, in Salt Lake City, Utah. As the second of four children, Lynch was raised in West Texas. Lynch's father was a lawyer; Lynch's mother was a noted watercolorist and an amateur pianist who influenced him to create music as a child. Other early influences included hymns and soundtracks. Lynch began studying the piano at the age of six. At age twelve, he was inspired by Andrés Segovia's classical recordings and decided to pursue a career in music. After attending High School in both St. Stephen's Episcopal School and Austin High School, Lynch went to the Austin campus of the University of Texas. After studying there for a year, he moved to Barcelona with his then wife Ginny and his child. Over there, he was apprenticed to Eduardo Sainz de la Maza, a classical guitar teacher. Three years later Lynch returned to the university to study composition with various instruments including guitar, lute, and vihuela. While Lynch went on to become a musician, his siblings ended up becoming lawyers.

Life and career
In 1967, while still in college, Lynch was invited to New York City to join The Renaissance Quartet, performing the lute alongside Robert White (tenor), Barbara Mueser (viol), and Morris Newman (recorder), replacing Joseph Iadone. Lynch also performed with other groups, such as ""Festival Winds"", as well as collaborative and solo performances. Lynch also taught the guitar, lute, and vihuela in the Mexican city of Taxco in the late 1960s. During his career, Lynch purchased a 125-acre farm in Maine. By 1974, Lynch experienced a ""spiritual crisis"" that led to his decision to move from Maine to California and give up his musical career. Although he became a carpenter and a purchasing agent in California, Lynch also continued to practice his compositional skills. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, Lynch said that his return to music was prompted by a suggestion from his spiritual teacher, Adi Da, in California.
To prepare for his return to music, Lynch bought an ARP Odyssey with ""borrowed money"" in 1980; the synthesizer helped him create music in the developing electronic genre. Two years later, Lynch released his first album, Truth Is the Only Profound, which recites the teachings of Adi Da ""set to the background of devotional music and songs"". Lynch later followed up with an instrumental album, The Sky of Mind. When Lynch released his third album, Deep Breakfast, in 1984 independently, he sold over 72,000 albums out of his small apartment. Lynch was featured on Musical Starstreams on June 1985. Immediately after joining Music West in Winter 1985, he released Deep Breakfast to a wider audience. The album was eventually certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 1989, No Blue Thing became Lynch's first album to hit #1 on Billboard's ""Top New Age Albums"" chart.  No Blue Thing was also his only album to appear on Billboard's ""Top 200 Albums"", peaking at #197. It won Billboard's ""Top New Age Album"" in 1990, and Lynch also won Billboard's ""Top New Age Artist"" in both 1989 and 1990.
During his time with Music West, Lynch was featured on Good Morning America as well as the Spanish La 1 program ""Música N.A."". In 1991, Lynch sued Music West for allegedly not paying him for his work. He left Music West, taking the rights to his music with him, and signed up with Windham Hill Records. Under the new label, Lynch's albums The Sky of Mind and No Blue Thing (but not Deep Breakfast) were re-released on September 1992 with new album covers.
Under the new record company, Lynch followed up with his final album, the classical Nothing Above My Shoulders but the Evening, in 1993. The album featured members of the San Francisco Symphony. Like the preceding album, it hit #1 on the ""Top New Age Albums"" chart. In 1998, Lynch released his first and only compilation album, Ray Lynch: Best Of, Volume One, which included two original tracks and a remix of ""Celestial Soda Pop"".   Lynch left Windham Hill in 2000 and re-released his own catalog of music under his own record company.
On September 2015, Lynch's house was destroyed by the Valley Fire, along with his studio, awards, and the master tapes of his music. As a result, his friend Grant Valdes Huling set up a GoFundMe page, which ultimately raised over $20,000.

Influences
Throughout his career, Lynch did not want his music to be classified as ""New Age"". In an interview with CD Review in August 1989, Lynch said he didn't really mind being labeled as a ""new age"" artist, but says that he doesn't like ""being grouped with music that I felt is, in general, pretty mediocre and boring"". Lynch also said that ""'classical' would be the best category for me.""
Lynch had been both a student and follower of Adi Da since 1974. In regards to the spiritual nature of his music, Lynch believed that it ""has to be judged subjectively by the listener, not the composer."" Lynch named several of his songs and albums after the themes found in Da's novel, The Mummery Book. However, in a 1989 Arizona Republic interview, Lynch clarified that he wasn't trying to promote Da's work through his music.  After the death of Adi Da, Lynch performed various songs for Da's tribute album, ""May You Ever Dwell In Our Heart"", in 2009.

Red (band),"Red (stylized as R3D or RED) is an American Christian rock band from Nashville, Tennessee, formed in 2002 by brothers guitarist Anthony Armstrong and bassist Randy Armstrong, with lead vocalist Michael Barnes. The band's first lineup also consisted of drummer Andrew Hendrix and guitarist Jasen Rauch. Currently, the lineup has consisted of the core trio of the Armstrong brothers and Barnes, along with drummer Brian Medeiros.
After they recorded several demos displaying a style of alternative, hard, and Christian rock music, Red landed a development deal with their longtime producer Rob Graves which led to a record deal with Christian label Essential Records in 2004. Their debut albums End of Silence (2006) and Innocence & Instinct (2009) were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, and spawned the popular singles ""Breathe Into Me"" and ""Death of Me"". Red's mainstream popularity grew and their third album, Until We Have Faces (2011), reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200, which was followed by Release the Panic (2013), which peaked at No. 7, Of Beauty and Rage (2015), Gone (2017), Declaration (2020), and Rated R (2023).

History
Formation and signing with Essential (2002–2004)
Red was formed by identical twin brothers, guitarist Anthony and bassist Randy Armstrong, and lead vocalist and pianist Michael Barnes. The three grew up in Linesville, Pennsylvania, where Barnes first met the Armstrongs at elementary school and remained friends. They gained inspiration to pursue a music career after they attended festivals, including acts at the Christian-themed Creation Festival, and wished to perform on stage. They became members of Ascension, their early gigs taking place in youth centres around Erie, Pennsylvania, playing covers of contemporary Christian music before they turned to hard rock. After the three finished their education, they relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in February 2002 after Audio Adrenaline guitarist Barry Blair had heard their music online and invited them to record. The three worked day jobs, Barnes as a nurse in an emergency room and the Armstrongs in a mall, while using their spare time to form their own musical style, which was influenced by Linkin Park, Sevendust, and Chevelle as they liked the band's emotionally-driven music. The first lineup of Red was completed in 2004 following the addition of drummer Andrew Hendrix and guitarist Jasen Rauch. Randy said they wished for a band name that was ""short, meaningful, and easy to remember"", and spent two years searching for groups with a similar name and secured a trademark with ""Red"".
With the lineup secured, Red entered a longtime association with producer, songwriter, and musician Rob Graves. After they had recorded four demos in a garage and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves to listen to their music for his opinions. Graves recalled: ""It was really rough, all over the map, but I could hear the elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential"". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full-length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: ""We are Christians in a band, but if people feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we do not shy away from that"". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.

End of Silence (2004–2008)
After spending two years on the album, End of Silence was released on June 6, 2006. Recorded in Nashville, the album features orchestral arrangements from Bernie Herms and David Davidson, reflecting on the group's interest in classical music. Rauch gave his insight on mainstream music and his own influences to the rest of the band as they were primarily followers of Christian music and had little knowledge of contemporary pop. The band's logo was designed by Randy Armstrong. It had a successful impact, receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Gospel Album at the 49th awards, and reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers and No. 7 on the Top Christian Albums charts. Later in 2007, it was re-released by Epic Records, and entered the Billboard 200 chart at No. 194. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2015 for selling over 500,000 physical copies in the US. The first of its six singles, ""Breathe Into Me"", reached No. 15 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, won a GMA Dove Award for Recorded Song of the Year in the rock category, and was certified gold by the RIAA in 2015 for 500,000 digital sales.
Red supported End of Silence with a tour that began in 2006 and supported by various acts, including Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and Candlebox. In November 2007, their transit van and trailer crashed into a guardrail on Interstate 24 and slid sideways across a highway, causing major damage to the vehicles and Lamb suffering injuries to his already injured shoulder that forced him to sit for some of the remaining dates. Lamb returned, but the injury had affected his ability to travel and perform which led to his departure in 2008. He was replaced by his friend Joe Rickard. The incident became a source of inspiration and ""fuel"" for the band's future songs. In 2009, ""Lost"" won a GMA Dove Award for Recorded Song of the Year at its 40th ceremony. By 2009, the band had performed over 500 gigs.

Innocence & Instinct (2008–2010)
Red started work on their second album, Innocence & Instinct, shortly after they had completed End of Silence. In January 2008, they began a six-week period rehearsing and laying down drum tracks so they could continue recording while on tour. Graves joined the group on the road and assembled a studio at the back of their tour bus. They would assemble hotel mattresses in a corner and record vocals in the enclosed space. Recording took place at Little Big Sound, The Graveyard, and Paragon Studios in Tennessee. and Their website issued a statement explaining the album ""was forged from a storm of inspiration and catastrophe"", and later revealed Dante's Inferno and artwork by Gustave Doré as inspirations behind the music. They halted its progress to headline a nationwide club tour in March 2008, their first without a restrictive time slot which allowed them to develop their stage performance.
Released on February 10, 2009, Innocence & Instinct fared better on the charts than their first effort, entering the Billboard 200 at No. 15 and selling 39,000 copies in its first week. ""Shadows"" was co-written by Breaking Benjamin founder and singer Benjamin Burnley. A Deluxe Edition was also released with ""Forever"", an additional track, and bonus features. The single ""Fight Inside"" became the first by a Christian rock band to enter the Radio & Records charts at No. 1. In 2009, Red unveiled their new website to coincide with the video and single release of ""Forever"". Soon after, the band confirmed that Lamb had left the band due to the injuries sustained from the car crash along with Rauch, who wished to dedicate time with his family, and Rickard had become a full-time member. Rauch's contract with Red allowed him to continue writing for the band for some time after his departure. Innocence & Instinct won Rock Album of the Year at the 2010 GMA Dove Awards.
Red toured the album from February 2009 through 2010 with Saving Abel, Pop Evil, and Taddy Porter on the Class of 2009 Tour. On their website the band announced that they will be touring with Pillar and The Wedding on their new tour ""Nothing and Everything"" Tour which started in January 2010. In March, the band toured with Breaking Benjamin, Thousand Foot Krutch and Chevelle, followed by the Awake and Alive Tour with Skillet and The Letter Black.

Until We Have Faces (2010–2012)
Red worked on new material for Until We Have Faces during their 2009–2010 tours. They travelled with a portable case that unfolds into a mini recording studio, allowing them to put down ideas in the green room at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving the rest of the group to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.

Until We Have Faces was released on February 1, 2011. The band released a teaser video online, featuring the band's name on a sheet of parchment which burns away and revealing the album's title. A picture was posted on Graves's Twitter account showing three guitars with tape on them showing tunings of A#, A, and G#, which hinted that this record may be heavier than the previous two. As part of the preliminary hype for the album, Red asked fans to send photos of their faces to the band. On December 9, codes were given to all fans that sent in pictures of their faces to download an MP3 for the song ""Feed the Machine"". The fan photos were used to create a mosaic poster. Red promoted the album's release with performances on the network television shows Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, their first television appearances. The album also debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. ""Feed the Machine"" started to be added to Active Rock Radio stations in mid-February. Until We Have Faces has sold approximately 100,000 copies in the US. ""Start Again"" won Best Rock Recorded Song of the Year at the 2011 GMA Dove Awards.
Red was a part of the 2011 WinterJam lineup which started up in January. They joined Union Entertainment label-mates Hinder on their All American Nightmare Tour which kicked off on May 10, 2011. On June 5, 2011, they started their Kill Th3 Machin3 Tour with Oh No Fiasco, Taddy Porter, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Evans Blue. In September 2011 they went on the ""Rock Allegiance Tour"" with Buckcherry, Papa Roach, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Crossfade and Drive A. They hit the road immediately after this to start their second leg of the Kill Th3 Machin3 Tour, with Brian ""Head"" Welch, Echoes the Fall and Icon for Hire. The tour ended in Atlanta, Georgia on October 26. RED completed the WinterJam 2011 WEST COAST in November and participated in Christmas Rock Night during the holiday season. Red was also the first band to ever enter Loudwire's Cage Match Hall of Fame, beating bands like Skillet, Seether, and Nickelback. In 2011, Red were made Grand Marshalls of a parade in Linesville, Pennsylvania, the town where the Armstrongs and Barnes grew up.
In February and March 2012 they were on the Redvolution Tour with Thousand Foot Krutch, Manafest, Nine Lashes, and Kiros. Red announced a European tour in April 2012.

Release the Panic (2012–2014)
On July 10, 2012, Red announced their fourth album, Release the Panic, was in progress. For the first time in their career, the band worked with a different producer other than Graves, choosing Howard Benson. He intentionally stripped the band's sound and made it less produced, and Red adopted a more melodic and alternative rock sound than previous releases. They worked one year and a half on writing the music, and around two years recording. The first single, ""Release the Panic"", was released in November 2012. Release the Panic was released on February 5, 2013. The album debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 7, with first week sales of around 41,000. Red coincided the release of Release the Panic with their 3-disc anthology album Who We Are: The Red Anthology, formed of their first three albums.
Their subsequent tours culminated in Rickard's final performance with the band on January 26, 2014, before he finished the sessions for the Red remix EP Release the Panic: Re-Calibrated, released on April 29, 2014, and left the group. Debuting at No. 75 on the Billboard 200 charts, the release includes six songs from Release the Panic with orchestral arrangements and new elements added to the original tracks and one new song. Rickard was replaced by Love and Death drummer Dan Johnson, in time for an eight-city tour with Demon Hunter and Veridia.

Of Beauty and Rage (2014–2017)
For their fifth studio release, Red resumed their association with Graves and, in January 2014, returned to the ski lodge studio in Maine to develop material for Of Beauty and Rage. As they prepared new material, they discussed what they had learned while making Release the Panic and what they wished to do differently for the new album. A snowstorm occurred during this time, forcing the group inside which, according to Barnes, benefited the writing process. They produced four demos as the result of what they thought Red fans wanted to hear, and aspects in life that passionately drives them. The group experienced ""personal heartbreak and loss"" while making it, and named the opening and closing instrumental tracks ""Descent"" and ""Ascent"" respectively, as they found studio time partnered with their faith uplifting. During the album's recording, Red announced their total career sales had totalled 1.1 million units.
The album was released on February 24, 2015, and debuted at No. 14 on the Billboard 200 charts. A graphic novel, The Ever, telling the story behind the album, was released in January 2016.
In June 2016, End of Silence was re-released as a deluxe edition to commemorate its tenth anniversary. It contains a new song, ""If I Break"", a song already cut but left off the original album, an instrumental demo, ""Circles"", and other bonus content. Red celebrated the release with an anniversary tour which marked the return to performing songs from the album after a long time, playing smaller venues, and using older instruments.

Gone (2017–2018)
On September 26, 2017, Gospel Music Association released an article about an upcoming album. The article also stated that Red had sold almost 2 million albums. Material for Red's sixth album, Gone, was already being worked on in November 2016, with the main rehearsal sessions taking place the month after. Anthony Armstrong expressed a shift in releasing albums in the traditional way due to the decline in physical sales and the popularity of digital music. He also said the group would stray from Christian music markets more on this release, and would focus more efforts into promoting and touring within the general music market, which is where they began. Gone was officially announced in September 2017, and released on October 27, debuting at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 charts. A 17-track deluxe edition was also released.
In March and April 2018, they toured with Lacey Sturm, Righteous Vendetta and Messer.

Declaration (2019–2022)
The band posted an update, via a YouTube video on January 21, 2019. They announced that they were no longer signed to Essential/Sony and they would record their next album independently. They also announced that touring drummer Dan Johnson joined the band full-time as their fourth member, thus making a four-piece lineup for the first time since 2014. On June 7, the band released ""The Evening Hate"", their first new released music since leaving their record label. After announcing a small run of 10th anniversary tour dates for Innocence & Instinct, the band released another single, ""From the Ashes"", accompanied by a lyric video, and announced more tour dates. On September 17, they announced a tour with In Flames for 36 dates across North America. On October 11, the band announced a new EP, The Evening Hate, would be released November 1, in addition to releasing a new single, ""Hemorrhage"", a cover of the Fuel song of the same name.
On January 10, 2020, the band announced that their seventh studio album, Declaration, was set for release on April 10, 2020. On March 25, the band announced that Declaration would be released a week earlier than its original April 10 release date. The album was released on April 3 as planned, and peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard 200 charts. On February 9, 2021, the band announced that they had parted ways with Dan Johnson. Shortly after Johnson's departure, the band hired new drummer Brian Medeiros.

Rated R (2023–present)
The group's first live album, Until We Have Faces: Live and Unplugged, was released on December 2, 2022. During the announcement of the live album's release, the band also announced that they would release a new album sometime in spring 2023. The band went on both headlining tours and supporting tours with American bands Alter Bridge, Mammoth WVH and Pistols at Dawn for January and the majority of February.
On January 24, 2023, they revealed the name of the new album to be Rated R on their Facebook page. On June 16, the band revealed the album would be released on September 29, 2023, while also stating that the lead single of the album titled ""Surrogates"" would be available for all streaming services on August 4. The band also announced they would embark on the ""Rated R Tour"", which started in September and carries on until 2024. On September 1, they released two new songs, ""Cold World"" and ""Minus It All"".

Rhian Sheehan,"Rhian Sheehan is a New Zealand composer and producer born in Nelson and now based in Wellington. He is known for his fusing of orchestral chamber music and piano, with ambient electronic and post-rock cinematic atmospheres. He has also written music for film, television, video games, exhibitions, advertisements, roller coaster rides, and planetarium dome shows.

Career
Sheehan released his debut album Paradigm Shift in 2001. The record was issued in the UK almost two years later in 2003, and received praise from music critics. In 2004, Britain's Future Music Magazine magazine named Sheehan as ""The Next Big Thing"" in ambient music. His 2009 album Standing in Silence, 2013's Stories from Elsewhere, and 2018's A Quiet Divide step away from his earlier electronica work into more of a shoegaze, post-rock, ambient, chamber music direction. Eminent US reviewer John Diliberto (host of Echoes) called Stories from Elsewhere ""a modern ambient chamber music masterpiece of quietly epic dimensions"".
Sheehan's work has featured on a variety of compilations, most notably the multi-platinum selling Cafe del Mar anthologies (vol. 10 and 11). His music has been heard on BBC's Top Gear, as well as The Discovery Channel, the National Geographic channel, and the HBO series Silicon Valley. His compositions have also been used in a variety of advertisements, including for such companies as Google, Facebook, Nike, and GoPro. In 2009, Sheehan composed the soundtrack to the British National Space Centre's We Are Astronomers, a 360° fulldome film (narrated by David Tennant). The same year, the artist wrote the score to the 13-part prime-time TV drama series The Cult (for which he was awarded a Qantas Film & TV Award for best original score), and the Emmy Award-winning web series Reservoir Hill. In 2012, Sheehan penned the score to the UK 3D planetarium documentary film We Are Aliens (narrated by Rupert Grint).
In July 2012, Japan's Preco Records released Sheehan's most recent albums Standing in Silence and Seven Tales of The North Wind together as a limited-edition double box set that included a remix of the track ""Borrowing the Past"" by American post-rock ambient group Hammock.
In March 2013, American label Darla Records released Stories from Elsewhere. The album was also released in Japan by Preco Records, and in New Zealand and Australia by LOOP Recordings. In October 2013, Sheehan completed writing the soundtrack to the US and UK-produced fulldome film Back to the Moon for Good. Commissioned by X Prize, the film is narrated by Tim Allen. The 25-minute digital production highlights the history of Moon exploration and provides an insider's look at the teams vying for the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize. The film was produced by the British National Space Centre, the X Prize Foundation, and Robert K. Weiss. The show is one of the most popular planetarium shows ever made, having screened in over 450 venues across the world.
In 2014, Sheehan contributed string arrangements for Jakob's album Sines. The record won the Taite Music Prize in 2015. In July 2015, Sheehan wrote and produced the orchestral soundtrack for the British 3D planetarium fulldome film We Are Stars (narrated by Andy Serkis), for which he was awarded ""Best Soundtrack"" at The 2015 Fiske Fulldome Film Festival. In August 2015, the artist released his first live album, Rhian Sheehan - Live at The Wellington Opera House. In December 2016, he scored the soundtrack for Weta Workshop's new Dr. Grordbort's exhibition.
The 2017 debut album SweetSexySavage by American R&B artist Kehlani features a sample of the Rhian Sheehan track ""Waiting"". The sample is used as the backbone to the track ""Not Used to It"".
In October 2018, Sheehan wrote the music for Magic Leap and Weta Workshop's 3D mixed-reality game Dr. Grordbort's Invaders.
On 12 October 2018, Loop Recordings & Kobalt Music released Sheehan's album A Quiet Divide. The album reached no.2 on the NZ Top 20.
In September 2019, Sheehan travelled to New York with artist Joseph Michael to collaborate on a large-scale audio-visual installation projected on the United Nations building. The installation ran for three nights, leading up to the UN Climate Action Summit. The art piece featured an original score by Sheehan and music by Brian Eno, and included the voices of six young climate change activists.
In January 2022, Sheehan composed the orchestral score for the roller coaster ride ""Mission Ferrari"" at Ferrari World, in Abu Dhabi.

Personal life
Rhian is the nephew of New Zealand photographer Laurence Aberhart and the son of travel and landscape photographer/publisher Grant Sheehan.
He is married to musician Raashi Malik.
Sheehan appears in James Cameron's films Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water as a military engineer. The scene was filmed in Miramar, Wellington, in the same suburb where Rhian lives. Sheehan also wrote the trailer music featured in Cameron's 4K theatrical re-release of The Abyss.

Rhys Fulber,"Nowell Rhys Fulber (born October 10, 1970) is a Canadian electronic musician and producer. He is a member of Front Line Assembly and Delerium, along with Bill Leeb. He also records under his own name and under the name Conjure One.

Biography
Fulber was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on October 10, 1970. His father, a musician, was born in Germany and his mother was from Great Britain. His father introduced him to the music of Led Zeppelin and Kraftwerk; they both attended a Kraftwerk concert in 1975. Fulber became interested in music and started drumming on his father's instruments at a very early age. Along with Kraftwerk, Fulber's electronic influences included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Jean-Michel Jarre, SPK, and Pete Shelley's Homosapien (1981). He has cited OMD as his favourite band in his youth.
His father later built and ran a recording studio, catering toward the local punk rock scene. As a youth, Fulber spent a lot of time at the studio. In 1984 he started becoming more interested in electronic music and acquired his first synthesizer.
In 1986, he became friends with Bill Leeb, who had just left his former band Skinny Puppy. 
Fulber is a first cousin of Shawn Atleo (Ahousaht First Nation), a Canadian activist and politician, who was elected twice as national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, serving 2009 into 2014.

Early music career
Fulber's first involvements in Front Line Assembly were one song on their second cassette release Total Terror, and then three songs on The Initial Command. He also contributed to Delerium's debut album, Faces, Forms & Illusions. During this time he started the band Will together with Chris Peterson, John McRae and Jeff Stoddard, which lasted from 1987 to 1992.
He joined Front Line Assembly for their first tour, Gashed Senses & Crossfire in 1989. He then joined Delerium full-time when Michael Balch left. Until 1997, Fulber was involved in all Front Line Assembly, Delerium and side projects with Bill Leeb, including the albums Tactical Neural Implant and Hard Wired from Front Line Assembly, and Semantic Spaces and Karma from Delerium.

Leeb and Fulber released several albums as Synæsthesia, including Embody, Desideratum and Ephemeral.
Fulber was nominated for the Jack Richardson Producer Of The Year award at the 2008 Juno Awards and won two Junos with Delerium for Best Dance Recording in 1998 and 2000.

Production
As Front Line Assembly was beginning to peak, their UK label Third Mind was bought out by Roadrunner Records, a predominantly metal label.  An up-and-coming band on the label Fear Factory was looking to expand their sound with remixes and new label mates Front Line Assembly were contacted.  This led to the influential Fear Is the Mindkiller EP.  From this more metal themed work followed while Fulber was contracted to contribute keyboards and de facto additional production to Fear Factory's breakthrough Demanufacture album, defining their signature sound. Fulber had also contributed backing tracks around this same time to new Canadian industrial rock band Econoline Crush, leading to their signing with EMI Canada and eventually his first full length production job handling their debut album Affliction, spawning minor Canadian rock radio hit ""Wicked"".  From there his production career grew and became more varied.  The later success of Delerium bringing him into more adult music formats with artists like Josh Groban and Serena Ryder. Based out of Los Angeles since 2000, he currently works out of his own studio, Surplus Sound in Van Nuys.

Rob Haigh,"Robert Haigh, also known as Omni Trio, is a British electronic, ambient and experimental musician.

Career
Early work (1979–1991)
At school, Haigh was in a band called Labyrinth playing original material that was influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music. In the early 1980s Haigh released a series of experimental ambient albums under the names Robert Haigh and Sema – the most notable being ‘Three Seasons Only’ and ‘Notes From Underground’. He also contributed to several Nurse With Wound projects and formed an industrial avant-funk band called The Truth Club together with Trefor Goronwy, who would go on to join This Heat. In a 1994 feature in The Wire on ambient jungle by Simon Reynolds, Haigh's influences were listed as Pere Ubu, The Pop Group, Can, Faust and Neu! as well as Miles Davis and King Tubby.

Omni Trio (1992–2004)
In the 1990s, Haigh developed a unique style of what has become known as ‘ambient drum 'n' bass’ and released six EPs and six albums under the name Omni Trio to great acclaim. The Omni Trio sound is notable for its intricate breakbeat patterns, orchestrated production, atmospheric sound palette, sweetly melodic piano vamps, and creative use of sampled soul-diva vocals. Omni Trio was one of the original drum 'n' bass producers, who first released for Moving Shadow as early as 1993. He produced several anthems in the period now known as ""old skool"", including ""Mystic Stepper (Feel Better)"", ""Renegade Snares"", ""Thru the Vibe"", and ""Living for the Future"". All of these featured on his acclaimed first LP, The Deepest Cut Vol 1 (1995), which was released under the title Music For The Next Millennium that same year in the US through Sm:)e Communications.
He followed this up with The Haunted Science in 1996, which included the singles ""Trippin' on Broken Beats"" and ""Nu Birth of Cool"". Mainstream trends in dancefloor-oriented drum 'n' bass rapidly diverged from his musical style, and subsequent albums Skeleton Keys (1997), the Detroit techno-influenced Byte Size Life (1999), and Even Angels Cast Shadows (2001) produced no big club hits on the scale of his early singles, but they further cemented his reputation as one of the finest album-oriented musicians in the genre. Indeed, he was the first drum'n'bass artist to produce six full-length artist albums.
Many Omni Trio tracks feature on popular video games: ""Renegade Snares"" appears in the game Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, ""First Contact"" (from Even Angels Cast Shadows) is featured in Grand Theft Auto 3 and ""Secret Life"" is featured in the futuristic racing video game Rollcage Stage II.
Following the release of the sixth and final Omni Trio album Rogue Satellite in 2004, Haigh decided to cease recording as Omni Trio.

Current work (2005–present)
Since Omni Trio, Haigh has released a series of modern classical and minimalist albums under his own name: the post Minimalist From the Air (2006) and Written on Water (2008), and the piano works: Notes and Crossings (2009), Anonymous Lights (2010), Strange and Secret Things (2011), and Darkling Streams (2013). On his decision to cease recording as Omni Trio he has said: ""After Even Angels Cast Shadows and especially the minimal structures of Rogue Satellite, I felt that perhaps my work was done in this particular area. All along the intention was to do the Omni Trio stuff alongside producing and releasing piano based material under my own name. Then the Omni thing blew up much bigger than I had anticipated. But throughout the '90s I also kept writing piano and minimal themes. By the early 2000s the time seemed right to put the emphasis on developing this material.""
In 2014, German label VOD released the compilation album Cold Pieces. This is a companion collection to 2012's Time Will Say Nothing box set. These two compilations represent Haigh's earliest solo output – covering most of the eighties (1982 to 1989.) Where Time Will Say Nothing focused on Haigh's darker and more industrial period, Cold Pieces represents the evolution into more piano based experimentation.
In January 2015, Haigh released an 18 track collection of piano compositions called The Silence Of Ghosts. Much of the material on The Silence of Ghosts is developed from piano improvisation. In a recent interview he states: ""Most of my compositions start from freeform improvisation at the piano. Later I revisit the more compelling themes and from there, structures start to emerge. I never use formal notation just the odd rough diagrams and written reminders.""

Robert Fripp,"Robert Fripp (born 16 May 1946) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer, and author, best known as the guitarist, founder and longest-lasting member of the progressive rock band King Crimson. He has worked extensively as a session musician and collaborator, notably with David Bowie, Blondie, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall, The Roches, Talking Heads, and David Sylvian. He also composed the startup sound of Windows Vista operating system, in collaboration with Tucker Martine and Steve Ball. His discography includes contributions to more than 700 official releases.
His compositions often feature unusual asymmetric rhythms, influenced by classical and folk traditions. His innovations include a tape delay system known as Frippertronics and new standard tuning.

Early life
Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England, the second child of a working-class family. His mother Edith (née Greene; 1914–1993) was from a Welsh mining family; Fripp considers himself to be half Welsh. Her earnings from working at the Bournemouth Records Office allowed his father, Arthur Henry Fripp (1910-1985) to start a business as an estate agent. In 1957, at age eleven, Fripp received a guitar for Christmas from his parents and recalled, ""Almost immediately I knew that this guitar was going to be my life"". He then took guitar lessons from Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike; at age 11, Elvis Presley's guitarist Scotty Moore inspired Fripp to play rock'n'roll, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15. He cited jazz musicians Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus as his musical influences during this time.
In 1961, the 15-year-old Fripp joined his first band, The Ravens, which also included Gordon Haskell on bass. After they split in the following year, Fripp concentrated on his O-level studies and joined his father's firm as a junior negotiator. At this point, he intended to study estate management and, eventually, take over his father's business. However, at seventeen, Fripp decided to become a professional musician. He became the guitarist in the jazz outfit The Douglas Ward Trio, playing in the Chewton Glen Hotel of New Milton, followed by a stint in the rock and roll band The League of Gentlemen which included two former Ravens members.
In 1965, Fripp left the group to attend Bournemouth College, where he studied economics, economic history, and political history for his A-levels. In February 1965, Fripp went to see the Duke Ellington Orchestra, an experience which moved him deeply. He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at Bournemouth's Majestic Hotel (replacing future The Police guitarist Andy Summers, who had gone off to London with Zoot Money). It was during this time when he met musicians that he would collaborate with in his career: John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James, and Greg Lake. At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxemburg where he heard the last moments of ""A Day in the Life"". ""Galvanized"" by the experience, he went on to listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Béla Bartók's string quartets, Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony, Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Many years later, Fripp would recall that ""although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn't say no"".

Career
1967–1974: Giles, Giles and Fripp and King Crimson
In 1967, Fripp responded to an advertisement placed by Bournemouth-born brothers Peter and Michael Giles, who wanted to work with a singing organist. Though Fripp was not what they sought, his audition with them was a success and the trio relocated to London and became Giles, Giles and Fripp. Their only studio album, The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp, was released in 1968. Despite the recruitment of two further members – singer Judy Dyble (formerly with Fairport Convention and later of Trader Horne) and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald – Fripp felt that he was outgrowing the eccentric pop approach favoured by Peter Giles (preferring the more ambitious compositions being written by McDonald) and the band broke up in 1968.

Almost immediately, Fripp, McDonald and Michael Giles formed the first lineup of King Crimson in mid-1968, recruiting Fripp's old Bournemouth College friend Greg Lake as lead singer and bass player, and McDonald's writing partner Peter Sinfield as lyricist, light show designer and general creative consultant. King Crimson's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, was released in late 1969 to great success: drawing on rock, jazz and European folk/classical music ideas, it is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of progressive rock. The band was tipped for stardom but (due to growing musical differences between Fripp on one side and Giles and McDonald on the other) broke up after its first American tour in 1970. A despondent Fripp offered to leave the group if it would allow King Crimson to survive; however, Giles and McDonald had independently decided that the band's music was ""more Fripp's than theirs"" and that it would be better if they were the ones to leave.
During the recording of the band's second album In the Wake of Poseidon, Greg Lake departed to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer, leaving Fripp and Sinfield as the only remaining founder members. They issued two more albums (Lizard and Islands) and were the only constants in a regularly changing King Crimson lineup. It included (at various times) Gordon Haskell, saxophonist/flute player Mel Collins, drummers Andy McCulloch and Ian Wallace and future Bad Company bass player Boz Burrell, in addition to a palette of guest players from Soft Machine, Keith Tippett's band, Brotherhood of Breath and Centipede. Fripp was listed as the sole composer of the band's music during this time, which built on the first album's blueprint but progressed further into jazz rock and free jazz while also taking form from Sinfield's esoteric lyrical and mythological concepts.
In 1971, Fripp ousted Sinfield and took over de facto leadership of King Crimson (although he has always formally rejected the label, preferring to describe his role as ""quality control"" or ""a kind of glue""). From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas (which drew on avant-garde jazz and improvisation mixed with a variety of hard rock and European influences, in particular the music of Béla Bartók). With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, singing bass player John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with Larks' Tongues in Aspic, progressing with Starless and Bible Black and culminating in the benchmark avant-power trio album Red. Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations.

1974–1981: Collaborations, side projects, and solo career
Fripp pursued side projects during King Crimson's less active periods. He worked with Keith Tippett (and others who appeared on King Crimson records) on projects far from rock music, playing with and producing Centipede's Septober Energy in 1971 and Ovary Lodge in 1973. During this period he also worked with Van der Graaf Generator, playing on the 1970 album H to He, Who Am the Only One, and in 1971, on Pawn Hearts. He produced Matching Mole's Matching Mole's Little Red Record in 1972. Prior to forming the Larks-era KC, he collaborated on a spoken-word album with a woman he described as ""a witch"", but the resulting Robert Fripp & Walli Elmlark: The Cosmic Children of Rock was never officially released.
With Brian Eno, Fripp recorded (No Pussyfooting) in 1972, and Evening Star in 1974. These experimented with several avant-garde musical techniques that were new to rock. On ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" from No Pussyfooting, Fripp used a tape delay system using two modified Revox A77 reel-to-reel tape machines for the first time.  The technique went on to play a central role in Fripp's later work, and became known as ""Frippertronics"".
In 1973, Fripp performed the guitar solo on ""Baby's on Fire"", perhaps the best-known track on Eno's solo debut Here Come the Warm Jets. In 1975, Fripp and Brian Eno played live shows in Europe, and Fripp also contributed guitar solos to Eno's landmark album Another Green World.
Fripp started what was intended as a permanent sabbatical from his career in 1975, during which he cultivated an interest in the teachings of Gurdjieff via J. G. Bennett (studies which would later be influential in his work with Guitar Craft). He returned to musical work as a studio guitarist on Peter Gabriel's first self-titled album in 1976, released the following year. Fripp toured with Gabriel to support the album, but remained out of sight (either in the wings or behind a curtain) and used the pseudonym ""Dusty Rhodes"".
He produced and played on Gabriel's second album in 1978. ""Robert is particularly skilful at keeping things fresh, and I like that a lot,"" Gabriel enthused. ""I was very interested in Robert's experimental side; that corresponded exactly to what I wanted to do on this second record… There are two (Fripp) solos: one on 'On the Air' and the other on 'White Shadow'. And then he plays on 'Exposure'. He gives the colour to this piece, being fifty per cent responsible for its construction. And he also plays classical guitar here and there. He's a musician I admire a lot, because he's one of the only ones to mix discipline and madness with so much talent.""
In 1977, Fripp received a phone call from Eno, who was working on David Bowie's album ""Heroes"". Fripp and Eno had collaborated on an album released in 1975 called Evening Star. On this album – particularly 'An Index of Metals' – are strains that would influence the Bowie project two years later, notably its second side. Fripp's playing on Heroes initiated a series of collaborations with other musicians. Fripp soon collaborated with Daryl Hall on Sacred Songs.
During this period, Fripp began working on solo material, with contributions from poet/lyricist Joanna Walton and several other musicians, including Eno, Gabriel, and Hall (including the latter's partner, John Oates), as well as Peter Hammill, Jerry Marotta, Phil Collins, Tony Levin and Terre Roche. This material eventually became his first solo album, Exposure, released in 1979, followed by the Frippertronics tour in the same year.
While living in New York, Fripp contributed to albums and live performances by Blondie (Parallel Lines) and Talking Heads (Fear of Music), and produced The Roches' first and third albums, which featured several of Fripp's characteristic guitar solos. A second set of creative sessions with David Bowie produced distinctive guitar parts on Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) and prior to that, Peter Gabriel's third solo album known as Melt. With Blondie, Fripp appeared live on stage at Hammersmith Odeon on 12 January 1980 participating in the band's cover version of Bowie's ""'Heroes'"". This recording was on the 12"" single of Atomic released the same year and later turned up as a bonus track on CD pressings of Blondie's album Eat to the Beat.
In 1980, Fripp would release God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners, a project that saw two different musical approaches to Frippertronics on one LP record. The ""A"" side of the record, titled ""God Save the Queen"" attempted what Fripp referred to as ""pure Frippertronics"" which is ""where Frippertronics is used alone."" The ""B"" side of the record, titled ""Under Heavy Manners"" featured a collaboration with bassist Busta Jones, drummer Paul Duskin, and David Byrne (Byrne credited as Absalm el Habib). The sounds of this side of the record featured what Fripp called ""Discotronics"" which was defined as ""that musical experience resulting at the interstice of Frippertronics and disco.""
Concurrent to this, Fripp would assemble what he called a ""second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band"" under the name League of Gentlemen, with bassist Sara Lee, keyboardist Barry Andrews and drummer Johnny Elichaoff (credited as ""Johnny Toobad"").  Elichaoff was later replaced by Kevin Wilkinson. The LOG toured for the duration of 1980.
In 1985 he produced the album Journey to Inaccessible Places by classical pianist Elan Sicroff, released on the Editions E.G. label.

1981–1984: Reforming King Crimson
1981 saw the formation of a new King Crimson lineup, reuniting Fripp with drummer Bill Bruford and opening a new partnership with two American musicians: bass guitarist/Chapman Stick player Tony Levin (who had played with Fripp on Exposure and in the first Peter Gabriel touring band) and Adrian Belew, a singer and guitarist who had previously played with Bowie, Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. Although the band had been conceptualised under the name Discipline it came to Fripp's attention that the other members thought the name King Crimson was more appropriate: for Fripp, King Crimson had always been ""a way of doing things"" rather than a particular group of musicians, and the current group felt that their music captured that methodology. With the more pop-inspired Belew as main songwriter (complementing Fripp as main instrumental composer) the band took on a new style incorporating a gamelan-inspired continuo minimalism, New York influences from post-punk to go-go, and textured experiments with guitar synthesizers. After releasing three albums (Discipline, Beat, Three of a Perfect Pair), this new King Crimson broke up in 1984.
During this period Fripp made two records with his old friend Andy Summers of The Police. On I Advance Masked, Fripp and Summers played all the instruments. Bewitched was dominated more by Summers, who produced the record and collaborated with other musicians in addition to Fripp.
In 1982 Fripp produced and played guitar on Keep on Doing by The Roches. As in his previous guesting on David Bowie's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (which also featured Pete Townshend and Chuck Hammer on guitar synthesizer), Fripp's distinctive guitar style and sound that characterised his music of this period is featured alongside the sisters' songs and harmony. Village Voice rock critic Robert Christgau wrote that ""This sounds so good I'm beginning to believe Robert Fripp was put on earth to produce the Roches.""

Guitar Craft
Fripp was offered a teaching position at the American Society for Continuous Education (ASCE) in Claymont Court, West Virginia in 1984. He had been involved with the ASCE since 1978, eventually serving on its board of directors, and had long been considering the idea of teaching guitar. His course, Guitar Craft, was begun in 1985, an offshoot of which was a performance group, ""The League of Crafty Guitarists"", which has released several albums. In 1986, he released the first of two collaborations with his wife, Toyah Willcox. The members of the California Guitar Trio are former members of The League of Crafty Guitarists and have also toured with King Crimson. Fripp is the patron of the Guitar Circle of Europe, which was founded in 2007, and of the Seattle Circle Guitar School, which was founded in 2010.
In February 2009, Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft cease to exist on its 25th anniversary in 2010.
On 1 September 2022 Fripp published The Guitar Circle, a book of writings concerning Guitar Craft.

Soundscapes
Fripp returned to recording solo in 1994, using an updated version of the Frippertronics technique that creates loops employing digital technology instead of analogue tapes. Fripp has released a number of records that he called ""soundscapes"", including 1999, Radiophonics, A Blessing of Tears, That Which Passes, November Suite, The Gates of Paradise, Love Cannot Bear and At the End of Time, as well as numerous download-only live recordings. (The sampler Pie Jesu consists of material compiled from A Blessing of Tears and The Gates of Paradise.)

1990s collaborations with David Sylvian and others
Fripp's collaborations with David Sylvian feature some of his most exuberant guitar playing. Fripp contributed to Sylvian's twenty-minute track ""Steel Cathedrals"" from his Alchemy: An Index of Possibilities album of 1985. Then Fripp performed on several tracks from Sylvian's 1986 release, Gone to Earth.
In late 1991, Fripp had asked Sylvian to join a re-forming King Crimson as a vocalist. Sylvian declined the invitation, but proposed a possible collaboration between the two that would eventually become a tour of Japan and Italy in the spring of 1992.
Also in 1991, Fripp released an album with the project Sunday All Over The World, also featuring his wife Toyah Willcox, former League of Crafty Guitarists member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick, and drummer Paul Beavis. The prior name of this band was Fripp Fripp, and they toured as such in 1988. They renamed to SAOTW, and toured again as SAOTW, in 1989.
In July 1993, Sylvian and Fripp released the collaborative effort The First Day. Other contributors were soon-to-be King Crimson member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick and Jerry Marotta (who, like Sylvian, almost became a member of King Crimson) on drums. When the group toured to promote the CD, future King Crimson member Pat Mastelotto took over the drumming spot. The live document Damage was released in 1994, as was the joint venture, Redemption – Approaching Silence, which featured Sylvian's ambient sound sculptures (Approaching Silence) accompanying Fripp reading his own text (Redemption).
During the early and mid-1990s Fripp contributed guitar/soundscapes to Lifeforms (1994) by the Future Sound of London and Cydonia (released 2001) by the Orb, as well as FFWD, a collaborative effort with the latter's members. In addition, Fripp worked with Brian Eno co-writing and supplying guitar to two tracks for a CD-ROM project released in 1994 entitled Headcandy created by Chris Juul and Doug Jipson. Eno thought the visual aspects of the disc (video feedback effects) were very disappointing upon completion, and regretted participation. During this period, Fripp also contributed to albums by No-Man and the Beloved (1994's Flowermouth and 1996's X, respectively). He also contributed soundscapes and guitar to two albums by the UK band Iona: 1993's Beyond These Shores and 1996's Journey into the Morn.

King Crimson redux (1994–2010)
In late 1994, Fripp re-formed the 1981 line-up of King Crimson for its fifth incarnation, adding Trey Gunn and drummer Pat Mastelotto in a configuration known as the ""double trio"" (the line-up included two guitars, two bass/Stick players and two drummers). This line-up released the VROOOM EP in 1994, and the Thrak album in 1995.
Though musically (and relatively commercially) successful, the double-trio King Crimson proved difficult to sustain in the long-term. From 1997 to 1999, the band ""fraKctalised"" into five experimental instrumental sub-groups known as ProjeKcts. By 1998 Bruford had quit the band altogether: in 2000, Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto reunited as a four-piece King Crimson (minus Levin, who was busy with session work). This lineup produced two studio albums, the construKction of light in 2000 and The Power to Believe in 2003, which took on a more metallic, heavily electronic approach. Gunn departed at the end of 2003.
Although Levin immediately returned to the band, another hiatus followed until King Crimson reappeared in 2007 with a second drummer - Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree - appended to the lineup, This version of the band played a brief eastern USA tour in 2008, reassessing its 1981-2003 back catalogue and approach and introducing lengthy percussion duets between the two drummers. No new original material was recorded, and in 2010, Fripp announced that King Crimson were on another indefinite hiatus.

Recent work: G3, Porcupine Tree, Slow Music, Theo Travis, the Humans, Jakko Jakszyk, Others
In 2004, Fripp toured with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as the guitar trio G3. He also worked at Microsoft's studios to record the startup sound for Windows Vista. Fripp designed the soundscape and composed the melody, while Tucker Martine created the rhythm and Microsoft's own Steve Ball added the harmonies and created the final arrangement.

In late 2005 and early 2006, Fripp joined sometime R.E.M./Nine Inch Nails drummer Bill Rieflin's improvisational Slow Music project, along with guitarist Peter Buck, Fred Chalenor (acoustic bass), Matt Chamberlain (drums) and Hector Zazou (electronics). This collective of musicians toured the west coast of America in May 2006.
In 2006 Fripp contributed his composition ""At The End Of Time"" to the Artists for Charity album Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged children. Throughout 2006, Fripp would perform many solo concerts of soundscapes in intimate settings in churches around England and Estonia. In October 2006, ProjeKct Six (Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew) played at select venues on the east coast of the U.S., opening for Porcupine Tree. In the same year, Fripp contributed soundscapes to two songs for Porcupine Tree's Fear of a Blank Planet - ""Way Out of Here"" and ""Nil Recurring"", the second of which was released in September 2007 as part of the Nil Recurring EP. Fripp also sporadically performed Soundscapes as an opening act for Porcupine Tree on various tours from 2006 through 2009.
In 2008, Fripp collaborated with Theo Travis on an album of guitar and flute-or-saxophone duets called 'Thread', and the duo played a brief English tour in 2009 (repeating the collaboration with the Follow album in 2012). Also in 2009, Fripp played a concert with the band the Humans (which consists of his wife Toyah Willcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), appeared on Judy Dyble's Talking With Strangers (along with Pat Mastelotto and others) and played on two tracks on Jakko Jakszyk's album The Bruised Romantic Glee Club. In 2010, Fripp contributed a guitar solo to an extended version of the song 'Heathen Child' by Grinderman, released as a B-side on the 'Super Heathen Child' single.
In 2021, the ambient/electronica album Leviathan was released. Fripp produced it and played guitar, in collaboration with British EDM Duo The Grid.

A Scarcity of Miracles, musical 'retirement' and new lineup of King Crimson
In May 2011, Jakko Jakszyk, Robert Fripp and Mel Collins released a song album called A Scarcity of Miracles: A King Crimson ProjeKct on the Panegyric label. The album also featured contributions by Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison, leading to speculation that the project was a dry run for a new King Crimson.
In an interview published 3 August 2012, Fripp stated that he had retired from working as a professional musician, citing long-standing differences with Universal Music Group and stating that working within the music industry had become ""a joyless exercise in futility"". This retirement proved to be short-lived, lasting as long as it took to come to a settlement with UMG.
In his online diary entry for 6 September 2013, Fripp announced the return of King Crimson as a seven-piece unit with ""four Englishmen and three Americans"". The new lineup was Fripp, Levin, both Mastelotto and Harrison on drums, returning 1970s band member Mel Collins and two new members: Jakko Jakszyk as singer and second guitarist, and Bill Rieflin as a third drummer. This version of the band went on tour in 2014 and 2015 with a setlist reworking and reconfiguring the band's 1960s and 1970s material (plus songs from A Scarcity of Miracles and new compositions). In early 2016, it was announced that former Lemon Trees/Noel Gallagher drummer Jeremy Stacey would substitute for Rieflin on that year's tour while the latter was on sabbatical. King Crimson has since continued touring as a seven- or eight-piece unit with Stacey as a permanent member on drums and keyboards, plus Rieflin (when available) on keyboards and ""fairy dusting"". Rieflin last played with Crimson on the 2018 tours; he died 24 March 2020.

Equipment
During the early years of King Crimson (1968–74), Fripp used two Gibson Les Paul guitars from 1957 and 1959. The '57 guitar featured three humbucker pick-ups (with one volume control on the pickguard controlling the middle pick-up). In the band's 1980s era, he favoured Roland GR-303 & GR-808 guitars for both straight guitar and synth control. In subsequent years, Fripp has used customized Les Paul-style guitars by Tokai, 48th St Custom, and Fernandes (the latter being his current choice).
A signature model named for the guitarist (Crimson Guitars Robert Fripp Signature) features Fernandes Sustainer and MIDI pickups with a Les Paul-style body. A significant difference from the Gibson Les Paul is that the signature model is built using a deep set neck tenon rather than a traditional set neck.
Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft students adopt the Ovation 1867 Legend steel-string guitar, which had a shallow body. ""Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions"", according to Tamm. While the 1867 Legend is no longer manufactured, it influenced the design of the Guitar Craft Pro Model of Guitar Craft Guitars, which  has been endorsed by Fripp.

Guitar technique
Fripp began playing guitar at the age of eleven. When he started, he was tone deaf and had no rhythmic sense, weaknesses which led him later to comment ""Music so wishes to be heard that it sometimes calls on unlikely characters to give it voice."" He was also naturally left-handed but opted to play the guitar right-handed.
While being taught guitar basics by his teacher Don Strike, Fripp began to develop the technique of crosspicking, which became one of his specialities. Fripp teaches crosspicking to his students in Guitar Craft.
In 1985, Fripp began using a tuning he called ""New Standard tuning"" (C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4), which would also become popularised in Guitar Craft.
Fripp's guitar technique, unlike most rock guitarists of his era, is not blues-based but rather influenced by avant-garde jazz and European classical music. He combines rapid alternate picking and crosspicking with motifs employing whole-tone or diminished pitch structures and sixteenth-note patterns for long stretches in a form called moto perpetuo (perpetual motion).
Rather than stand when performing, he seats himself on a stool (unusual for a performer in rock music), and by doing so was called in a May 1974 issue of Guitar Player ""the guitarist who sits on stage"".

Comments from other artists
Many artists have cited Fripp as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him, including U2's The Edge, Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López, Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Michael Angelo Batio, Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche, Nels Cline of Wilco, Adam Jones of Tool, Merzbow, Vernon Reid of Living Colour, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Paul Masvidal of Cynic, Steve Stevens of Billy Idol, Chris Haskett of Rollins Band, Ivar Bjørnson of Enslaved, Dylan Carlson of Earth, Dan Briggs, Denis ""Piggy"" D'Amour of Voivod, Daniel Mongrain, Marcus Henderson, Paul Lemos of Controlled Bleeding, Richard Pinhas, Nick Reinhart of Tera Melos, Leopold Ross, electronic musician Rustie, film director Hal Hartley, and Sean Beavan.

Personal life
Fripp married singer and actress Toyah Willcox on 16 May 1986 in Poole, Dorset, England. From December 1987 until July 1999 they lived at and renovated Reddish House, the former home of Cecil Beaton, in the village of Broad Chalke in Wiltshire.
Fripp previously lived at Thornhill Cottage, Holt, Dorset (1971-1980) and Fernhill House, Witchampton (1980-1987). After Reddish House, the couple lived at Evershot Old Mansion (1999-2001). They then moved to their present home in Pershore, Worcestershire. The couple have no children and have arranged their will so as to leave their entire fortune to the establishment of a musical educational trust for children.
Fripp is the patron of the Seattle Circle Guitar School in the United States and the Shallal Dance Theatre in Penzance, England. He also has had engagements as a motivational speaker, often at events with his sister Patricia, who is a keynote speaker and speech coach.
Alfie Fripp, the last of the ""39ers"", shot down by the Luftwaffe and then held in 12 different POW camps during World War II, was his uncle.
Fripp is a pescetarian.
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, Fripp and Willcox uploaded many short, humorous videos to YouTube, usually covers of well-known songs, and mostly titled Toyah and Robert's Sunday Lunch. According to rock and metal news website MetalSucks, their stories about these covers were extremely popular; their cover of Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" was the site's 6th-most popular story that year.
The duo toured the UK in 2023, performing the Sunday Lunch songs in concert.

Awards and honours
Asteroid 81947 Fripp, discovered by Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo in 2000, was named in his honour. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (M.P.C. 114955).
Fripp is ranked 62nd on Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time after having been ranked 42nd by David Fricke on its 2003 list. Tied with Andrés Segovia, he is ranked 47th on Gibson's Top 50 guitarists of all time.

Discipline Global Mobile
In 1992, Fripp and producer/online content developer David Singleton co-founded Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) as an independent music label. DGM releases music by Fripp, KC, related acts, and other artists in CDs and in downloadable files. A 1998 Billboard profile stated that DGM had ten staff-members in Salisbury (England) and Los Angeles (USA). DGM has an aim ""to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed."" DGM insists that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's ""knotwork"" corporate-logo (pictured above) is owned by its designer, Steve Ball; the ""knotwork"" logo appeared earlier on the cover of later versions of the Discipline album. DGM's aims were called ""exemplary"" by Bill Martin (1997), who wrote that ""Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music"" in creating DGM, which ""has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for"" King Crimson.
DGM publishes an on-line diary by Fripp, who often comments on performances and on relations with fans. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, Fripp's diary and the fan forum display delayed dialogs in which Fripp and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings.

Copyright infringement complaints
In 2009, Fripp released a statement claiming that EMI & Sanctuary Universal had uploaded music to various music stores without his consent, stating ""NONE of these downloads were licensed, authorised or legitimised. that is, every single download of any KC track represents copyright violation. or, to use one syllable instead of seven, theft.""
In 2011, Fripp complained that the music-distribution service Grooveshark continued to stream his music despite his having delivered repeated takedown notices. Fripp and Grooveshark's correspondence was published by Digital Music News and in his diaries, which appear on the website of Discipline Global Mobile.
Fripp's published exchange was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011. UMG cited internal documents revealing that Grooveshark employees uploaded thousands of illegal copies of UMG-owned recordings. Fripp had previous experience protecting his music in litigation with music companies.
Fripp has stated he believes ""Unauthorised streaming or MP3 giveaways - it amounts to the same thing - copyright theft.""

Discography
Fripp has been extremely active as a recording musician and a producer. He has contributed to more than 700 official releases. The Robert Fripp Discography Summary, compiled by John Relph, also lists 120 compilations and 315 unauthorised releases (such as bootlegs). This means that more than 1100 releases (including both official and unofficial ones, as well as both studio and live recordings) can be found with Fripp participating.

Robert Miles,"Roberto Concina (3 November 1969 – 9 May 2017), known professionally as Robert Miles, was an Italian record producer, composer, musician and DJ. His 1995 composition ""Children"" sold more than 5 million copies and topped the charts worldwide.

Early life
Robert Miles was born in Fleurier, Switzerland, to Italian parents.
Miles became proficient at playing the piano during his youth in Friuli, Italy, in the small town of Fagagna, where his family moved when he was young, and had been in the music scene since 1984. He worked as a DJ in some Italian clubs and private radio networks, and in 1990 he used his savings to establish his own recording studio and a pirate radio station.

Music career
1994–1997: Breakthrough and Dreamland
In 1994, Miles wrote a trance and chill-out piece based on acoustic guitar chords and soft synthesizer effects, ""Children"", which was later developed into a dream house song featuring a piano theme on top. The single picked up sales slowly; however, within two weeks of its official release in 1995, it had sold more than 350,000 copies all over Europe and topped the charts in many countries. The single received an unprecedented ""Essential Tune of The Week"" three weeks in a row on Pete Tong's show, causing a furious bidding war. It was then signed to Deconstruction Records in the UK by Giles Goodman of Dynamik Music (who represented Platipus Records the initial UK licensee). After occupying the Euro Top 100 chart number 1 spot for thirteen consecutive weeks (see European Hot 100 Singles) by 1997, ""Children"" had sold more than five million copies worldwide. It earned Miles platinum records in many countries, a Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act 1997 (Miles was the only Italian artist to have received the award until its final award for that category in 2012), a World Music Award as World's Best Selling Male Newcomer, and various other awards.
Miles' next single was ""Fable"". Part of this song was used in the theatrical trailer for the U.S. movie Ever After (see Ever After § Trailer) starring Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott. His debut album Dreamland was released on 7 June 1996 in Europe, and released in the United States about a month later. The album included a cover of ""One and One"" featuring British singer Maria Nayler. This cover became very popular (it reached number 1 in the Euro Top 100 Singles Chart during the Christmas period and remained in the top spot for six consecutive weeks) and was later released as a single in Europe and the U.S.

1997–1998: 23am
In November 1997, Miles released another track, ""Freedom"", which was one of the key tracks on his second album 23am, featuring vocals provided by Kathy Sledge of Sister Sledge. Containing a different feel from the previously more club-oriented Dreamland, 23am incorporated more lyrics-driven songs than its predecessor while maintaining Miles' trademark piano sound from the first album.

1998–2002: Departure from label and Organik
After splitting from Deconstruction, BMG and his former management in London, he set up his own independent record label Salt Records (stylised as S:alt Records, with S:alt being short for suitably:alternative) in 2001 and released his third album, Organik, featuring the new single ""Paths"" with vocals provided by Nina Miranda of Smoke City. Guests on the album included Trilok Gurtu, Bill Laswell and Nitin Sawhney. Music from Organik was used on various movie soundtracks such as The Bourne Identity, Derrida, and City of Ghosts. It was licensed to Narada Productions' Shakti Records label in the USA. In 2002, an album containing mainly remixes of songs found on Organik was released. The album, appropriately entitled Organik Remixes, contained remixes by the winners of the remixing contest held on Robert Miles's Web site, as well as remixes from well-known artists such as Future Sound of London, Riton, and Alexkid among others. The album also had one new track, ""Bhairav"", which featured the vocals of Amelia Cuni.

2004–2005: Miles_Gurtu
In 2004, Miles released Miles Gurtu, his fourth album, which was a collaboration with percussionist Trilok Gurtu and included jazz and electronica elements. Also guesting on the album were Nitin Sawhney, Jon Thorne, Mike Patto and Paul Falloon.

2011–2012: Thirteen
Miles' fifth album, entitled Thirteen, was released worldwide on Salt Records in February 2011. For this album, Miles produced a blend of alternative and progressive rock with ambient and electronic soundscapes.
In 2012 Miles finished working on the soundtrack for the movie documentary The Turn of THIS Century, directed by Peter Beyak and featuring the photography of Life Magazine. He founded a new FM and online alternative radio station, Open Lab, broadcasting from Ibiza, a project bringing together culture, arts, media, technology and innovation.

Death
Miles died from metastatic cancer in Ibiza, Spain, on 9 May 2017 at the age of 47.
Miles’ OpenLab station was taken off-air shortly afterwards, pending discussions on the future of the station.  After receiving many messages from people expressing dismay at the station's suspension, it was announced that the station would be returning soon in 2019, starting with a live radio stream in January 2019 and followed by a reboot to radio on 106.4 FM in Ibiza in April 2019.

Robert Rich (musician),"Robert Rich (born August 23, 1963) is an ambient musician and composer based in California, United States. With a discography spanning over 30 years, he has been called a figure whose sound has greatly influenced today's ambient music, New-age music, and even IDM.

Biography
1980s: sleep concerts and early career
During Rich's time at Stanford University in the 1980s, he became well known in the San Francisco Bay Area for giving live night-time performances for somnolent or sleeping audiences. These were experiments to influence REM cycle sleep with auditory stimulus. They were usually nine hours long and lasted from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. During these performances, he would generate abstract drones and atmospheres while the audience dozed in sleeping bags that they brought themselves. In the morning he ended the concert with piano solos and served tea.
During this time, he released four albums on cassette: Sunyata (1982), Trances (1983), Drones (1983), and his first live album titled Live (1984). The first of these was recorded when he was 18. The music on these albums reflects similar drone music atmospheres to those of his sleep concert series.
Rich applied to study at Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. He scheduled a meeting with John Chowning, the founder of the class and inventor of FM synthesis. When Chowning saw Rich’s first three albums, Rich was approved for the class. 
In 1983, he and Rick Davies together with a bassist named Andrew McGowan formed a group called ""Urdu"". It performed several live concerts in the San Francisco Bay area. The group dissolved after a live radio broadcast in 1984. Some of the group's recorded material was released as a self-titled album in 1985.
In 1987, he released an album titled Numena. This was the beginning of a new sound for Rich. It was his first album to explore complex rhythmic patterns, a wider range of acoustic instrumentation, and just intonation. It was also his first album to be released on CD originally.

1990s–2000s
In the years that followed he developed a complex range of sounds founded upon the seamless integration of electronic, electric, and acoustic instrumentation, and the exploration of complex just tunings. His music continues to tend toward the organic and much of it is based on a concept in synthesis he refers to as glurp. His interest in using unique sounds has inspired him to create a large collection of original field recordings and homemade instruments. One of these instruments is a range of flutes made from PVC pipe.
His interest in unique sounds has also given him work as a sound designer for synthesizer presets and for E-mu Systems’ Proteus 3 and Morpheus sound modules. He has also designed sounds for films including Pitch Black and Behind Enemy Lines, a series of sampling discs called Things that Go Bump in the Night, and a library of Acid Loops called Liquid Planet. He has also helped develop the MIDI micro-tuning specification, which is the standard used to create justly tuned compositions in MIDI.
His collaborators over the years have included Steve Roach, Brian ""Lustmord"" Williams, Lisa Moskow, Alio Die, and Ian Boddy.
In 1992, he formed a new group called Amoeba. The group has released three albums featuring ex-Urdu members Rick Davies and Andrew McGowan at different times.
In 2001, he released an album titled Somnium, a 7-hour album divided into three tracks on one DVD video. This album was a recreation of the sleep concert environment he created during the 1980s at Stanford. Although not officially recognized, many people believe it to be the longest artist album of all time.
In 2004, he released an album of piano solos titled Open Window. This album documents his improvised piano style that has been part of his live concerts for decades. It was recorded on a 1925 vintage A.B. Chase baby grand piano.
On March 11, 2005, Rich suffered a hand injury while cleaning a glass jug, accidentally slipping and falling on top of it. During the recovery process, he continued to record new material and tour. He also constructed end-blown flutes from PVC pipe that are more easily played with limited right-hand dexterity.
During his 2006 tour, Rich performed in front of a film created by visual artist Daniel Colvin as a backdrop. After the tour, he created a score for the film, which was released on CD and DVD in 2007 under the title Atlas Dei. In 2007 he also released the album Illumination, a companion soundtrack of a multimedia installation by Michael Somoroff, and a collaboration album with touch guitarist Markus Reuter.

Rurutia,"Rurutia (ルルティア) is a Japanese singer-songwriter. She began her career in 2001 with the release of the single ""Itoshigo yo"" when she was signed with Toshiba-EMI. She has released twelve albums and eleven singles. Rurutia is intensely private; most aspects of her life – including her real name, date of birth, and hometown, are kept private, and she has never appeared on a TV program or held a live concert since her debut. Her mass media appearances have been limited to broadcasts of the Internet radio program ""RURUTIA Planet,"" which began streaming on her official website after she became independent, interviews with photos posted on her official website, and interviews in music magazines. As for avoiding media exposure, she cites the glamorous world of the public spotlight and her own musical world as being at odds with each other. This, added to her whispered vocals, creates a unique and mysterious artistic persona.
Her pseudonym, Rurutia, is derived from the Tahitian word 'rorotea' meaning ""blissful rain"".

Ryuichi Sakamoto,"Ryuichi Sakamoto (Japanese: 坂本 龍一, Hepburn: Sakamoto Ryūichi, January 17, 1952 – March 28, 2023) was a Japanese composer, pianist, record producer, and actor who pursued a diverse range of styles as a solo artist and as a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). With his bandmates Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto influenced and pioneered a number of electronic music genres.
Sakamoto began his career as a session musician, producer, and arranger, while he was at university in the 1970s. His first major success came in 1978 as co-founder of YMO. He pursued a solo career at the same time, releasing the experimental electronic fusion album Thousand Knives in 1978, and the album B-2 Unit in 1980. B-2 Unit included the track ""Riot in Lagos"", which was a significant contribution to the development of electro and hip hop music. He went on to produce more solo records, and collaborate with many international artists, David Sylvian, Carsten Nicolai, Youssou N'Dour, and Fennesz among them. Sakamoto composed music for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and his composition ""Energy Flow"" (1999) was the first instrumental number-one single in Japan's Oricon charts history.
As a film score composer, Sakamoto won an Oscar, a BAFTA, a Grammy, and two Golden Globe Awards. Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983) marked his debut as both an actor and a film-score composer; its main theme was adapted into the single ""Forbidden Colours"" which became an international hit. His most successful work as a film composer was The Last Emperor (1987), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, making him the first Japanese composer to win an Academy Award. after which he continued earning accolades composing for films such as The Sheltering Sky (1990), Little Buddha (1993), and The Revenant (2015). On occasion, Sakamoto also worked as a composer and a scenario writer on anime and video games. He was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the Ministry of Culture of France in 2009 for his contributions to music.

Early life
Ryuichi Sakamoto was born on January 17, 1952, in Tokyo. His father, Kazuki Sakamoto, was a well-known literary editor, and his mother, Keiko (Shimomura) Sakamoto, designed women's hats.
He began taking piano lessons at age 6, and started to compose at age 10. His early influences included Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy — whom he once called ""the door to all 20th century music."" He also said, “Asian music heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me. So, the music goes around the world and comes full circle."" He discovered jazz and rock and roll as a teenager, when he fell in with a crowd of hipster rebels. He was also influenced by jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, and by rock bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. He described his political leanings during his time as a student as “not a 100 percent Marxist, but kind of”. At the height of the Japanese student protest movement, he and his classmates shut down their high school for several weeks.

Career
Sakamoto entered the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1970, earning a B.A. in music composition and an M.A. with special emphasis on both electronic and ethnic music. He studied ethnomusicology there with the intention of becoming a researcher in the field, due to his interest in various world music traditions, particularly the Japanese, Okinawan, Indian, and African musical traditions. He was also trained in classical music and began experimenting with the electronic music equipment available at the university, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP.

1970s
In 1975, Sakamoto collaborated with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki to release Disappointment-Hateruma. After working as a session musician with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi in 1977, the trio formed the internationally successful electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) in 1978. Known for their seminal influence on electronic music, the group helped pioneer electronic genres such as electropop/technopop, synthpop, cyberpunk music, ambient house, and electronica. The group's work has had a lasting influence across genres, ranging from hip hop and techno to acid house and general melodic music. Sakamoto was the songwriter and composer for a number of the band's hit songs—including ""Yellow Magic (Tong Poo)"" (1978), ""Technopolis"" (1979), ""Nice Age"" (1980), ""Ongaku"" (1983), and ""You've Got to Help Yourself"" (1983)—while playing keyboards for many of their other songs, including international hits such as ""Computer Game/Firecracker"" (1978) and ""Rydeen"" (1979). He also sang on several songs, such as ""Kimi ni Mune Kyun"" (1983). Sakamoto's composition ""Technopolis"" (1979) was credited as a contribution to the development of techno music, while the internationally successful ""Behind the Mask"" (1978)—a synthpop song in which he sang vocals through a vocoder—was later covered by a number of international artists, including Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton.
Sakamoto released his first solo album Thousand Knives of Ryūichi Sakamoto in mid-1978 with the help of Hideki Matsutake—Hosono also contributed to the song ""Thousand Knives"". The album experimented with different styles, such as ""Thousand Knives"" and ""The End of Asia""—in which electronic music was fused with traditional Japanese music—while ""Grasshoppers"" is a more minimalistic piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of electronic musical instruments, including various synthesizers, such as the KORG PS-3100, a polyphonic synthesizer; the Oberheim Eight-Voice; the Moog III-C; the Polymoog, the Minimoog; the Micromoog; the Korg VC-10, which is a vocoder; the KORG SQ-10, which is an analog sequencer; the Syn-Drums, an electronic drum kit; and the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which is a music sequencer that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto. A version of the song ""Thousand Knives"" was released on the Yellow Magic Orchestra's 1981 album BGM. This version was one of the earliest uses of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, for YMO's live performance of ""1000 Knives"" in 1980 and their BGM album release in 1981.

1980s
In 1980, Sakamoto released the solo album B-2 Unit, which has been referred to as his ""edgiest"" record and is known for the electronic song ""Riot in Lagos"", which is considered an early example of electro music (electro-funk), as Sakamoto anticipated the beats and sounds of electro. Early electro and hip hop artists, such as Afrika Bambaataa and Kurtis Mantronik, were influenced by the album—especially ""Riot in Lagos""—with Mantronik citing the work as a major influence on his electro hip hop group Mantronix. ""Riot in Lagos"" was later included in Playgroup's compilation album Kings of Electro (2007), alongside other significant electro compositions, such as Hashim's ""Al-Naafyish"" (1983).
According to Dusted Magazine, Sakamoto's use of squelching bounce sounds and mechanical beats was later incorporated in early electro and hip hop music productions, such as ""Message II (Survival)"" (1982), by Melle Mel and Duke Bootee; ""Magic's Wand"" (1982), by Whodini and Thomas Dolby; Twilight 22's ""Electric Kingdom"" (1983); and Kurt Mantronik's The Album (1985). The 1980 release of ""Riot in Lagos"" was listed by The Guardian in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music. Resident Advisor said the track anticipated the sounds of techno and hip hop music, and that it inspired numerous artists from cities such as Tokyo, New York City and Detroit. Peter Tasker of Nikkei Asia said it was influential on techno, hip hop and house music.
One of the tracks on B-2 Unit, ""Differencia"" has, according to Fact, ""relentless tumbling beats and a stabbing bass synth that foreshadows jungle by nearly a decade"". Some tracks on the album also foreshadow genres such as IDM, broken beat, and industrial techno, and the work of producers such as Actress and Oneohtrix Point Never. For several tracks on the album, Sakamoto worked with UK reggae producer Dennis Bovell, incorporating elements of afrobeat and dub music.
Also in 1980, Sakamoto released the single ""War Head/Lexington Queen"", an experimental synthpop and electro record, and began a long-standing collaboration with David Sylvian, when he co-wrote and performed on the Japan track ""Taking Islands in Africa"". In the following year, Sakamoto collaborated with Talking Heads and King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew and Robin Scott for an album titled Left-Handed Dream. Following Japan's dissolution, Sakamoto worked on another collaboration with Sylvian, a single entitled ""Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music"" in 1982. Sakamoto's 1980 collaboration with Kiyoshiro Imawano, ""Ikenai Rouge Magic"", topped the Oricon singles chart.
In 1983, Sakamoto starred alongside David Bowie in director Nagisa Oshima's Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. In addition to acting in the film, Sakamoto also composed the film's musical score and again collaborated with Sylvian on the film's main theme (""Forbidden Colours"") – which became a minor hit. In a 2016 interview, Sakamoto reflected on his time acting in the film, claiming that he ""hung out"" with Bowie every evening for a month while filming on location. He remembered Bowie as ""straightforward"" and ""nice"", while also lamenting the fact that he never mustered the courage to ask for Bowie's help while scoring the film's soundtrack as he believed Bowie was too ""concentrated on acting"".
Sakamoto broadened his musical range with a number of solo albums such Ongaku Zukan (1984), Neo Geo (1987), and Beauty (1989). These albums included collaborations with artists such as Thomas Dolby, Iggy Pop, Youssou N'Dour, and Brian Wilson.

1990s
Heartbeat (1991) and Sweet Revenge (1994) features Sakamoto's collaborations with a global range of artists such as Roddy Frame, Dee Dee Brave, Marco Prince, Arto Lindsay, Youssou N'Dour, David Sylvian, and Ingrid Chavez.
In 1995 Sakamoto released Smoochy, described by the Sound on Sound website as Sakamoto's ""excursion into the land of easy-listening and Latin"", followed by the 1996 album, which featured a number of previously released pieces arranged for solo piano, violin, and cello. During December 1996 Sakamoto, composed the entirety of an hour-long orchestral work entitled ""Untitled 01"" and released as the album Discord (1998). The Sony Classical release of Discord was sold in a jewel case that was covered by a blue-colored slipcase made of foil, while the CD also contained a data video track. In 1998 the Ninja Tune record label released the Prayer/Salvation Remixes, for which prominent electronica artists such as Ashley Beedle and Andrea Parker remixed sections from the ""Prayer"" and ""Salvation"" parts of Discord. Sakamoto collaborated primarily with guitarist David Torn and DJ Spooky—artist Laurie Anderson provides spoken word on the composition—and the recording was condensed from nine live performances of the work, recorded during a Japanese tour. Discord was divided into four parts: ""Grief"", ""Anger"", ""Prayer"", and ""Salvation""; Sakamoto explained in 1998 that he was ""not religious, but maybe spiritual"" and ""The Prayer is to anybody or anything you want to name."" Sakamoto further explained:

The themes of Prayer and Salvation came out of the feelings of sadness and frustration that I expressed in the first two movements, about the fact that people are starving in the world, and we are not able to help them. People are dying, and yet the political and economical and historical situations are too complicated and inert for us to do much about it. So I got really angry with myself. I asked myself what I could do, and since there's not a lot I can do on the practical level, all that's left for me is to pray. But it's not enough just to pray; I also had to think about actually saving those people, so the last movement is called Salvation. That's the journey of the piece.
In 1998, Italian ethnomusicologist Massimo Milano published Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni through the Padova, Arcana imprint. All three editions of the book were published in the Italian language. Sakamoto's next album, BTTB (1999)—an acronym for ""Back to the Basics"" is comprised a series of original pieces on solo piano influenced by Debussy and Satie and includes ""Energy Flow"" (a major hit in Japan) and an arrangement of the Yellow Magic Orchestra classic ""Tong Poo"".
Sakamoto's long-awaited ""opera"" LIFE was released in 1999, with visual direction by Shiro Takatani, artistic director of Dumb Type. This ambitious multi-genre multi-media project featured contributions from Pina Bausch, Bernardo Bertolucci, Josep Carreras, the Dalai Lama, and Salman Rushdie. In 2007, they ""deconstructed"" all the visual images and the sound, to create an art installation.

2000s
Sakamoto teamed with cellist Jaques Morelenbaum and singer Paula Morelenbaum, on a pair of albums celebrating the work of bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim. They recorded their first album, Casa (2001), mostly in Jobim's home studio in Rio de Janeiro, with Sakamoto performing on the late Jobim's grand piano. The album was well received, having been included in the list of The New York Times's top albums of 2002. A live album, Live in Tokyo, and a second album, A Day in New York, soon followed. Sakamoto and the Morelenbaums would also collaborate on N.M.L. No More Landmine, an international effort to raise awareness for the removal of landmines. The trio would release the single ""Zero Landmine"", which also featured David Sylvian, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Cyndi Lauper, and Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, the other two founding members of Yellow Magic Orchestra.
Sakamoto collaborated with Alva Noto (an alias of Carsten Nicolai) to release Vrioon, an album of Sakamoto's piano clusters treated by Nicolai's unique style of digital manipulation, involving the creation of ""micro-loops"" and minimal percussion. The two produced this work by passing the pieces back and forth until both were satisfied with the result. This debut, released on German label Raster-Noton, was voted record of the year 2004 in the electronica category by British magazine The Wire. They then released Insen (2005)—while produced in a similar manner to Vrioon, this album is somewhat more restrained and minimalist. After further collaboration, they released two more albums: utp_ (2008) and Summvs (2011).
In 2005, Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia hired Sakamoto to compose ring and alert tones for their high-end phone, the Nokia 8800. In 2006, Nokia offered the ringtones for free on their website. Around this time, a reunion with YMO cofounders Hosono and Takahashi caused a stir in the Japanese press. They released a single ""Rescue"" in 2007 and a DVD ""HAS/YMO"" in 2008. In July 2009, Sakamoto was honored as Officier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres at the French embassy in Tokyo.

2010s–2023
Throughout the latter part of the 2000s, Sakamoto collaborated on several projects with visual artist Shiro Takatani, including the installations LIFE – fluid, invisible, inaudible... (2007–2013), commissioned by YCAM, Yamaguchi, collapsed and silence spins at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in 2012 and 2013 Sharjah Biennial (U.A.E.), LIFE-WELL in 2013, and a special version for Park Hyatt Tokyo's 20th anniversary in 2014, and he did music for the joint performance LIFE-WELL featuring the actor Noh/Kyogen Mansai Nomura, and for Shiro Takatani's performance ST/LL in 2015.
In 2013, Sakamoto was a jury member at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. The jury viewed 20 films and was chaired by filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci.
On April 14, 2013, he also participated in a performance of film and music by video pioneer Nam June Paik, selected by musicians and composers who knew him well: himself, Stephen Vitiello, and Steina Vasulka.
In 2014, Sakamoto became the first guest artistic director of the Sapporo International Art Festival 2014 (SIAF2014). On July 10, Sakamoto released a statement indicating that he had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in late June of the same year. He announced a break from his work while he sought treatment and recovery. On August 3, 2015, Sakamoto posted on his website that he was ""in great shape ... I am thinking about returning to work"" and announced that he would be providing music for Yoji Yamada's Haha to Kuraseba (Living with My Mother). In 2015, Sakamoto also composed the score for the Alejandro González Iñárritu's film, The Revenant, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.
In January 2017 it was announced that Sakamoto would release a solo album in April 2017 through Milan Records; the new album, titled async, was released on March 29, 2017, to critical acclaim. In February 2018, he was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.
On June 14, 2018, a documentary about the life and work of Sakamoto, entitled Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda, was released. The film follows Sakamoto as he recovers from cancer and resumes creating music, protests nuclear power plants following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, and creates field recordings in a variety of locales. He also elucidates the influence of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky on the making of his then upcoming album async. Sakamoto says, ""When I started making the album, the sound that was in my mind was the Bach theme from Solaris, arranged on synthesizers by Eduard Artemyev. I arranged the same piece in the beginning of the process for async, and it sounded really good. It was very different from Artemyev's version, so I was very happy. Then I arranged four more Bach chorales next to that, and they all sounded really good. So I thought, maybe this is the album? Then I thought I needed to do something more, to write my own chorale. I tried, and that became the song ""solari"", obviously, with no ""s"". He later said, ""As I've been making music and trying to go deeper and deeper, I was finally able to understand what the Tarkovsky movies are about – how symphonic they are – it's almost music. Not just the sounds – it's a symphony of moving images and sounds. They are more complex than music."" He calls Tarkovsky and French director Robert Bresson his favorites, claiming their books – Notes on the Cinematographer and Sculpting in Time, respectively – as ""[his] bible.""
Directed by Stephen Nomura Schible, the documentary was met with critical praise.
In 2021 he was associate artist of Holland Festival in Amsterdam where he presented the world premiere of TIME, his last collaboration with his long-term collaborator Shiro Takatani. This ""wordless opera"", featuring dancer and actor Min Tanaka and shô player Mayumi Miyata was inspired by the first tale from Soseki Natsume's collection of short stories Ten Nights of Dreams.
In 2022 he took part in the creation of Dumb Type's new installation 2022 as a new member of the Japanese collective, for the Japan Pavilion at the 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia.
The same year Sakomoto collaborated with the young Ukrainian violinist Illia Bondarenko on the single ""Piece for Illia"" as part of the compilation fundraiser Ukraine (volume 2) for relief for victims of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.
On April 24, 2023, the song 'Snooze' was released by Agust D (Suga of BTS), in loving memory of Ryuichi Sakamoto,in which he is featured in the song as keyboards. He also appears in the music trailers leading up to the Agust D album, D-Day.

Production work
Sakamoto's production credits represent a prolific career in this role. In 1983, he produced Mari Iijima's debut album Rosé, the same year that the Yellow Magic Orchestra was disbanded. Sakamoto subsequently worked with artists such as Thomas Dolby; Aztec Camera, on the Dreamland (1993) album; and Imai Miki, co-producing her 1994 album A Place In The Sun. In 1996, Sakamoto produced ""Mind Circus"", the first single from actress Miki Nakatani, leading to a collaboration period spanning 9 singles and 7 albums though 2001.
Roddy Frame, who worked with Sakamoto as a member of Aztec Camera, explained in a 1993 interview preceding the release of Dreamland that he had had to wait a lengthy period of time before he was able to work with Sakamoto, who wrote two soundtracks, a solo album and music for the opening ceremony at the Barcelona Olympics, prior to working with Frame over four weeks in a New York studio. Frame said that he was impressed by the work of YMO and the Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence soundtrack, explaining: ""That's where you realise that the atmosphere around his compositions is actually in the writing – it's got nothing to do with synthesisers."" Frame's decision to ask Sakamoto was finalized after he saw his performance at the Japan Festival that was held in London, United Kingdom. Of his experience recording with Sakamoto, Frame said:

He's got this reputation as a boffin, a professor of music who sits in front of a computer screen. But he's more intuitive than that, and he's always trying to corrupt what he knows. Halfway through the day in the studio, he will stop and play some hip hop or some house for 10 minutes, and then go back to what he was doing. He's always trying to trip himself up like that, and to discover new things. Just before we worked together he'd been out in Borneo, I think, with a DAT machine, looking for new sounds.
In 1994, Japan Football Association asked Ryuichi Sakamoto to compose the instrumental song ""Japanese Soccer Anthem"". The composition was played at the beginning of Japan Football Association-sponsored events.

Film work
Sakamoto began working in films, as a composer and actor, in Nagisa Oshima's Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983), for which he composed the score, title theme, and the duet ""Forbidden Colours"" with David Sylvian. Soon after, he was the subject of Elizabeth Lennard's 1985 documentary Tokyo Melody, which mixes studio footage and interviews with Sakamoto about his musical philosophy in a nonlinear format, against a backdrop of 1980s Tokyo. Sakamoto later composed Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), which earned him the Academy Award with fellow composers David Byrne and Cong Su. In that same year, he composed the score to the cult-classic anime film Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise. Sakamoto also went on to compose for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
Other films scored by Sakamoto include Pedro Almodóvar's High Heels (1991); Bertolucci's The Little Buddha (1993); Oliver Stone's Wild Palms (1993); John Maybury's Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998); Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes (1998) and Femme Fatale (2002); Oshima's Gohatto (1999); Jun Ichikawa's (director of the Mitsui ReHouse commercial from 1997 to 1999 starring Chizuru Ikewaki and Mao Inoue) Tony Takitani (2005); and Andrew Levitas's Minamata (2020) starring Johnny Depp, Minami, and Bill Nighy.
Several tracks from Sakamoto's earlier solo albums have also appeared in film soundtracks. In particular, variations of ""Chinsagu No Hana"" (from Beauty) and ""Bibo No Aozora"" (from 1996) provide the poignant closing pieces for Sue Brooks's Japanese Story (2003) and Alejandro González Iñárritu's Babel (2006), respectively. In 2015, Sakamoto teamed up with Iñárritu to score his film, The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. The film Monster by director Hirokazu Kore-eda, released in 2023, was Sakamoto's final score; the film is dedicated to his memory.
Sakamoto also acted in several films: perhaps his most notable performance was as the conflicted Captain Yonoi in Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, alongside Takeshi Kitano and British rock singer David Bowie. He also played roles in The Last Emperor (as Masahiko Amakasu) and Madonna's ""Rain"" music video.

Personal life
In 1972, Sakamoto married Natsuko Sakamoto, with whom he had a daughter. The couple divorced in 1982, when Sakamoto married Japanese pianist and singer Akiko Yano, following several musical collaborations with her including touring work with the Yellow Magic Orchestra. Together, they had a daughter, singer Miu Sakamoto. Sakamoto's second marriage ended in August 2006, 14 years after a mutual decision to live separately. He then married his manager, Norika Sora, with whom he had two children, including Neo Sora, an artist and filmmaker.  Sakamoto lived primarily in New York City from 1990 until 2020, when he returned to Tokyo.

Health and death
Beginning in June 2014, Sakamoto took a year-long hiatus after he was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. In 2015, he returned, stating, ""Right now I'm good. I feel better. Much, much better. I feel energy inside, but you never know. The cancer might come back in three years, five years, maybe 10 years. Also the radiation makes your immune system really low. It means I'm very susceptible to another cancer in my body.""
On January 21, 2021, Sakamoto shared a letter on his website announcing that though his throat cancer had gone into remission, he was now diagnosed with rectal cancer, and that he was currently undergoing treatment after a successful surgery. He wrote, ""From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.""
Sakamoto died from cancer on March 28, 2023, at the age of 71. His death was announced on April 2, after his funeral had taken place.

Activism
Sakamoto was a member of the anti-nuclear organization Stop Rokkasho and demanded the closing of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant. In 2012, he organized the No Nukes 2012 concert, which featured performances by 18 groups, including Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kraftwerk. Sakamoto was also known as a critic of copyright law, arguing in 2009 that it is antiquated in the information age. He argued that in ""the last 100 years, only a few organizations have dominated the music world and ripped off both fans and creators"" and that ""with the internet we are going back to having tribal attitudes towards music.""
In 2015, Sakamoto also supported opposition to the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in the Ōmura Bay in Henoko, with a new and Okinawan version of his 2004 single ""Undercooled"" whose sales partially contributed to the ""Henoko Fund"", aimed to stop the relocation of the base on Okinawa.
Sakamoto was also an environmentalist. In one of his last public activities before his death, he sent a letter to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike in early March 2023 calling for the suspension and review of the planned redevelopment of the Jingūmae neighborhood in Tokyo due to environmental concerns.

Commmons
In 2006, Sakamoto, in collaboration with Japanese music company Avex Group, founded Commmons (コモンズ, Komonzu), a record label seeking to change the manner in which music is produced. Sakamoto explained that Commmons was not his label, but is a platform for all aspiring artists to join as equal collaborators to share the benefits of the music industry. On the initiative's ""About"" page, the label is described as a project that ""aims to find new possibilities for music, while making meaningful contribution to culture and society"". The name ""Commmons"" is spelt with three ""m""s because the third ""m"" stands for music.

Awards and nominations
Sakamoto won a number of awards for his work as a film composer, beginning with the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music for his score for Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, in 1984. His greatest award success was for scoring The Last Emperor (1987), which won him the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, as well as a BAFTA nomination in 1989.
His score for The Sheltering Sky (1990) won him his second Golden Globe Award, and his score for Little Buddha (1993) received another Grammy Award nomination. In 1997, his collaboration with Toshio Iwai, Music Plays Images X Images Play Music, was awarded the Golden Nica, the grand prize of the Prix Ars Electronica competition. He also contributed to the Academy Award winning soundtrack for Babel (2006) with several pieces of music, including the closing theme ""Bibo no Aozora"". In 2009, he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France's Ministry of Culture for his musical contributions. His score for The Revenant (2015) was nominated for the Golden Globe and BAFTA, and won Best Musical Score from the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association.

Röyksopp,"Röyksopp (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈrœ̂ʏksɔp]) are a Norwegian electronic music duo from Tromsø formed in 1998. The duo consists of childhood friends Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland who formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified their place in the electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.
Röyksopp has consistently experimented with various genres pertaining to electronic music. Stylistically, the band makes use of various genres, including ambient, house music and synth-pop. The band is also known for its elaborate concert performances, which often feature eccentric outfits.
Since their 1998 debut, the duo has gained critical acclaim and popular success around the world. To date, Röyksopp has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, won seven Spellemannprisen awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums that have topped the charts in several countries, including four consecutive number-one albums in their native country.

Band name
Røyksopp literally means ""smoke mushroom"" in English. It is the Norwegian word for the class of mushrooms known as puffball. The band's name replaces the second letter (ø) with ö, which is non-existent in the Norwegian alphabet but corresponds to the same sound in the Swedish alphabet.

History
1990–1997: Origins
Berge and Brundtland were introduced to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway, when Berge was 12 years old and Brundtland was 13. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two began playing music together due to a shared interest in electronica, experimented with various forms of electronic music. They bought a drum machine together part of the Tromsø techno scene of the early 1990s. Their childhood in Tromsø and the natural scenery of Northern Norway have often been mentioned as some of their most important inspirations. The pair separated before obtaining any popular success with their music, but reunited with each other in 1998 in Bergen, Norway.
Bergen, a city of 212,944 people in 1990, had overtaken Tromsø's position as the most vital scene for underground electronic music in Norway, and Röyksopp worked with other Norwegian musicians like Frost, Those Norwegians, Drum Island, and Kings of Convenience's guitarist and singer Erlend Øye in what was called the Bergen Wave. During this time, the duo befriended Geir Jenssen. Under the tutelage of Jenssen, the duo started a band called Aedena Cycle with Gaute Barlindhaug and Kolbjørn Lyslo. In 1994 Aedena Cycle recorded a vinyl EP called Traveler's Dreams. The EP was released under the R&S Records sublabel Apollo. Following the release of the EP, Jenssen almost convinced the band to sign a full record deal with Apollo Records.

1998–2000: Early years
After recording as part of Aedena Cycle, Berge and Brundtland left the group to form their own band, Röyksopp. The word röyksopp is a stylized version of the Norwegian word for the puffball mushroom, ""røyksopp"". The band has stated that the word could also evoke the mushroom cloud resulting from an atomic blast.
Röyksopp's debut single was released by local Bergen Wave-era independent label Tellé. Röyksopp's first single ""So Easy"", which was later re-released on their first album, was the second record released by Tellé. After being used in a UK T-Mobile advertisement, ""So Easy"" became popular in the UK market and was later re-released, combined with their later single ""Remind Me"".

2001–2004: Melody A.M. and early success
After leaving Tellé, the band signed with British label Wall of Sound and released Melody A.M., which became certified platinum in the band's native Norway and sold over a million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number one in Norway, and produced the UK Top 40 singles ""Eple"", ""Poor Leno"", and ""Remind Me"". A final single, ""Sparks"", was also released. Eple (IPA: [ˈɛ̀plə]) – meaning ""apple"" in Norwegian – was licensed by Apple Inc. for use as the welcome music to the company's Mac OS X Panther operating system, playing the first time a user booted a new Apple-brand computer.
The band's popularity was boosted by several graphically experimental music videos, many of which were put into heavy rotation by MTV. The music video for ""Remind Me"", featuring an infographic-style video by French company H5, won the 2002 MTV Europe Music Award for best music video. In this same event the duo was nominated in three more categories: ""Best Nordic Act"", ""Best New Artist"" and ""Best Dance Act"". The duo performed the song ""Poor Leno"" at the event. One year later they received a nomination for ""Best Group"" at the Brit Awards.
During this period Röyksopp slowly gained popularity in the United States. ""Remind Me"", one of the two Röyksopp and Erlend Øye collaborations found on Melody A.M., was featured in a Geico car insurance commercial, the fourth of the ""It's so easy a caveman could do it"" ads.
During this time, Röyksopp were approached to compose the soundtrack for The Matrix Reloaded, although they declined the offer.

2005–2008: The Understanding
Röyksopp's second studio album, The Understanding, was released on 12 July 2005, preceded by the single ""Only This Moment"" on 27 June 2005. The single managed to peak at number 33 in the United Kingdom. The video for ""Only This Moment"" is closely based on the events of the Paris 1968 riots, and elements of propaganda are found throughout the video clip. The album's second single, ""49 Percent"", with the vocals of Chelonis R. Jones was released on 26 September 2005. A third single, ""What Else Is There?"", including vocals from Swedish singer Karin Dreijer of The Knife, became the album's biggest single, peaking at number 32 in the United Kingdom, and at number four in Norway. ""Beautiful Day Without You"" was the album's fourth single, and a non-album track, ""Curves"", was also released.
Building upon the success of Melody A.M., The Understanding was very successful in Europe. The album peaked at number one in Norway, and at number 13 in the UK. During this time, Röyksopp's popularity continued to increase in the United States. The album charted on many Billboard charts, and peaked at number two on the Top Electronic Albums chart, number 22 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 32 on the Top Independent Albums.

After the release of The Understanding, some of Röyksopp's singles were licensed for movie appearances. ""What Else Is There?"" was featured during a scene in the 2007 American film Meet Bill and during the end credits of the 2006 British film Cashback, and ""Circuit Breaker"" was used in the 2007 snowboard film Picture This.
On 19 June 2006, Röyksopp released a nine-track live album called Röyksopp's Night Out. Notably, the album contains a reinterpretation of the song ""Go with the Flow"", originally by Queens of the Stone Age.
On 5 March 2007, Röyksopp compiled their favourite tracks by other artists for the Back to Mine series. Called Back to Mine: Röyksopp, the album was released in the US on 5 March 2007, and in the UK on 27 April 2007. The album also includes their own track ""Meatball"", released under the pseudonym ""Emmanuel Splice"". Svein Berge also contributed as a board member for the celebration of the Grieg year, as Norway celebrated their famous composer Edvard Grieg.
On the tenth anniversary of Röyksopp's formation—15 December 2008—the band released a new track, ""Happy Birthday"", free of charge to celebrate the event. The song was released via free streaming on the band's website.

2009–2012: Junior and Senior
Röyksopp's third studio album, Junior, was released on 23 March 2009, featuring the single ""Happy Up Here"". The song debuted on BBC Radio 1's Pete Tong show on 9 January 2009. It was officially released digitally on 16 March 2009. The music video for ""Happy Up Here"", made by Reuben Sutherland, features elements from the arcade game Space Invaders. Both the single and the video were met with positive reactions from the press and fans.
""The Girl and the Robot"", the second single from the album Junior, featuring vocals from Swedish singer Robyn, was released on 15 June 2009. The vinyl and digital versions of the single included remixes of the song by Kris Menace, Chateau Marmont and Spencer & Hill. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the Jean Elan remix of ""The Girl and the Robot"" was nominated for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical. ""This Must Be It"" is the third single from the album, including vocals from Swedish singer Karin Dreijer of The Knife and Fever Ray. The single also featuring remixes by Thin White Duke, LehtMoJoe, Rex the Dog and Apparat, among others. The band later released the stems for the song ""Tricky Tricky"" as part of a remix competition and the winning entries were released on 27 October 2009.

Junior was a success around the world. The album peaked at number one in Norway, the band's third consecutive release to do so. Junior also peaked at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart and charted on many Billboard charts, including the Billboard 200–the first Röyksopp release to do so–where it peaked at number 126. The album also peaked at number four on the Top Electronic Albums chart and number two on the Top Heatseekers chart.
Junior was followed by Senior, which is more quiet, ""withdrawn and introspective"" and ""create[s] an atmosphere and an ambiance"". Senior is the duo's first album to consist solely of instrumental tracks. The first single from the album, ""The Drug"", was released on 9 August 2010. The album itself was released on 13 September 2010, and was successful in the band's native Norway, peaking at number one, the band's fourth consecutive release to do so.

2013–2018: Do It Again, The Inevitable End and Star Wars Headspace
In January 2013, Röyksopp released a song called ""Running to the Sea"", a collaboration with Norwegian artist Susanne Sundfør. According to the band, the song was written and recorded in two days for a televised performance. The single was released on 16 December 2013, with a B-side containing a song called ""Something in My Heart"", featuring Jamie McDermott from The Irrepressibles. Röyksopp and Sundfør also collaborated in creating a cover version of Depeche Mode's ""Ice Machine"" for their Late Night Tales compilation album, Late Night Tales: Röyksopp.
On 14 April 2014, Röyksopp announced a collaborative EP with Robyn titled Do It Again to coincide with their joint tour. A snippet of one of the five tracks set to be released on the album, ""Monument"", was released the same day. The album was released on 26 May through Dog Triumph, Wall of Sound, and Cooking Vinyl. The duo stated that a re-worked version of ""Monument"" would form a part of their next album. On 29 September 2014, Röyksopp announced that their next album, titled The Inevitable End, would explore ""darker subject matter with emphasis on the lyrical content"", and would be their last LP, though they will not stop making music. The album was released on 7 November 2014 by Dog Triumph. The special edition of the album includes new versions of the previously released tracks ""Running to the Sea"", ""Do It Again"" and ""Monument"" as well as the original version of ""Something in My Heart"". Some singles did precede the release of the album: ""Skulls"", ""Sordid Affair"" and the new version of ""Monument"". ""Skulls"" and ""Monument"" were accompanied by two new video clips. The video for ""I Had This Thing"" was shared on 11 May 2015.
In early 2015, it was announced that the band had composed a musical accompaniment to a comedic work based upon the novels of Franz Kafka. The project debuted at the Bergen International Festival in the same year. Also in 2015, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK introduced a series of new jingles by Röyksopp for the TV output of the NRK Nyheter news division, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the sub-brand. The same year, they won the award for ""Best Cinematography"" at the Berlin Music Video Awards for their ""Skulls"" music video.
On 8 February 2016, Röyksopp announced that a new track titled ""Bounty Hunters"" would be included on the Star Wars Headspace compilation. The album was released on 19 February 2016. On 9 September 2016, Röyksopp released a new song, in collaboration with Susanne Sundfør, called ""Never Ever"". Additional remixes of the song have been released between February and April 2017, including Röyksopp's own club mix.

2019–2021: Lost Tapes
In February 2019, the band announced that they would be releasing B-sides, exclusives and previously unreleased tracks through the Lost Tapes playlist, starting with ""I Wanna Know"" and ""Rising Urge"". The tracks have been released for free on music streaming services, including Spotify and YouTube, but are also sold in digital stores like Amazon and the iTunes Store. In August 2019, Röyksopp released a collaborative single with Lars Vaular, called ""To minutter"". The band kept releasing new Lost Tapes until 25 January 2021, when they announced the project has come to a halt for the time being. In August 2021, the physical edition of Lost Tapes was announced for release on 17 September 2021. It contains the first 10 tracks from the series and is available on vinyl, CD and cassette.

2022–present: Profound Mysteries I, II and III
At the end of 2021, the band launched a new Instagram account which led to speculation of new music. Through a series of teasers with the tagline ""Press R"" on social media and snippets of new material on the redesigned official website, the band confirmed a new project would be released in 2022, titled Profound Mysteries.
Röyksopp described the ""conceptual project"" as an ""expanded creative universe"" and a ""continuous, holistic experience"", suggesting the release of three albums in 2022 (listed on the website as red, yellow and green). Each release in the series was accompanied by a series of short-films from multiple directors and AI-generated ""artefacts"" and visualisers by an Australian artist Jonathan Zawada.
The two new songs were officially released in January 2022,  ""(Nothing But) Ashes..."" and ""The Ladder"", followed by ""Impossible"" (featuring Alison Goldfrapp) in February. The Profound Mysteries album was released on 29 April 2022, with the band hosting a livestream of the album, followed by a tease of the next album and snippets of new music on the official website.
On 14 June 2022, the band released ""Sorry"", featuring Jamie Irrepressible as a lead single for Profound Mysteries II. At the same time the album became available for pre-order with ""Unity"", featuring Karen Harding available alongside it. A collection of remixes was also released. The second album was released on 19 August 2022, with the band once again hosting a YouTube event and teasing the next album, officially confirming the trilogy. 
A number of individual songs were released in a run-up to the third and final album, starting with ""Speed King"" and ""The Night"" in August 2022. Profound Mysteries III was released on 18 November 2022 and features collaborations with Jamie Irrepressible, Alison Goldfrapp, Susanne Sundfør and Astrid S, among other artists. The series has been also released on vinyl for the first time, as 6LP boxset featuring all three albums and individual 2LP releases. 
In 2023, the duo embarked on a headline tour and continued to release new remixes of the tracks from the Profound Mysteries series. The True Electric tour began in February 2023, with shows in European cities, including Stockholm, London and Berlin. The band described the tour as ""energetic beats meet vast, transcending soundscapes"" and explained their wish to bring ""the pure and immersive Röyksopp experience"" of studio productions to the stage. The shows were followed by appearances at various summer festivals in Europe including Bilbao BBK Live and Rock Werchter. The band continued their headline tour in autumn 2023 with 16 concerts in North America and Europe.

Style
Musical style
Röyksopp's music is often referred to as ""warm"", a reference to the band's downbeat electronica that combines elements of house music and Afro-American sounds.
A notable component of Röyksopp's repertoire is their use of multiple lead vocalists. For instance, Melody A.M. features the vocal talents of Anneli Drecker and Erlend Øye, The Understanding features Kate Havnevik, Chelonis R. Jones, and Karin Dreijer, and Junior features Robyn, Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer, and Lykke Li.
Röyksopp enjoy using classic synthesizers, including the monophonic Korg MS-20, the polyphonic Roland Juno-106, and multiple members of the Akai Sampler Series. The band has stated that they prefer using analogue synthesizers over digital ones. Svein Berge said, ""It's fairly limited the fun you can have with the use of a mouse. We like to mix.""
In addition to writing their own music, the duo enjoy remixing songs. Berge said, ""It's obviously fun remixing people like Coldplay, artists of such a big calibre. Whenever people approach us for a remix it's very nice; being approached by Roots Manuva, The Streets, and even Peter Gabriel is quite fun."" The band was also asked by Britney Spears for a remix, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.

Influences
As they grew up in Tromsø in northern Norway, Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland listened to local artists like Bel Canto and former Bel Canto member Biosphere (whom, coincidentally, Berge and Brundtland would remix in 1997 while they were part of Alanïa). The band has also expressed their interest in the music of Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Giorgio Moroder, Art of Noise, Vangelis, Erik Satie, and Francis Lai. Svein Berge has also stated that he is very fond of the production and programming skills of Datassette, who produced a remix of the Röyksopp single ""Happy Up Here"".
Röyksopp often include references and homages to their musical influences. For instance, ""Röyksopp Forever"" pays homage to famous electronica musicians from the 1970s, including, ""the likes of Vangelis and these people, and Krautrock, like Tangerine Dream and even Pink Floyd and King Crimson.""

Live performances
Röyksopp is known for its elaborate concert performances. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media said that ""Those who have heard Röyksopp's two albums ... won't be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer  [sic] local Crate & Barrel"". When performing live, the duo often appear in eccentric outfits. Ari Stein, of Electronic Beats, said, that during one particular live set, ""Röyksopp returned with two separate encores, one which included Berge playing ""Eple"" with a space suit capsule on his head"".

Reception and awards
Critical reception
In addition to sales success, Röyksopp has garnered generally positive reception from many music critics. The band has also been nominated for many prestigious awards, including multiple Spellemannprisens and a Grammy.
The tracks ""What Else Is There?"" and ""Eple"" were chosen among the top 500 tracks of the decade by Pitchfork Media and placed in 375th and 336th place respectively. Another track written by Röyksopp, Annie's ""Heartbeat"", was placed 17th on the same list. On 24 November 2009, Melody A.M. was named the best Norwegian album of the decade by Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang. The Understanding came 5th on the same list. In a ranking of the top 10 Norwegian tracks of the decade by VG, ""Eple"" and ""What Else Is There?"" were placed 3rd and 6th respectively.
However, some criticism has been aimed at the repetitive nature of the band and the trip hop genre in general. Robert Christgau said that, ""chill-out tends toward waiting-room music for plastic surgeons who really want you to order that butt implant. Where once [Röyksopp] were extolled for their subtle melodicism, here their schlock candidly attacks the jugular. If they're Air, Goldie was Tricky."" Pitchfork Media, in their review of Senior, said that ""the kind of downtempo stuff that makes up the majority of Röyksopp's vocal-less compositions just doesn't hold up to concentrated, repeated listens like many other forms of instrumental electronic music.""

Scorn (band),"Scorn is an English electronic music project. The group was formed in the early 1990s as a project of former Napalm Death members Mick Harris and Nic Bullen. Bullen left the group in 1995 and the project continued on until the end of 2011, as an essentially solo project for Harris. Harris restarted the project in 2019.

History
Scorn was formed in 1991 in Birmingham by drummer Mick Harris and vocalist/bassist Nic Bullen, former members of the grindcore band Napalm Death. Upon Bullen's departure in April 1995, Harris remained the only member of the project. Scorn has often been associated with industrial and experimental music, particularly with their Earache Records-era output between 1991 until 1994. Since the departure of Bullen in 1995, much of the output has been minimalist beats with an emphasis on very deep bass lines, often resembling dub and trip hop in structure.
Justin Broadrick (also a former Napalm Death member) provided guitar for the first LP, Vae Solis. The EP Lick Forever Dog was formed of remixes from the album. Evanescence featured James Plotkin on guitar and was followed by the remix album Ellipsis which featured reworkings by Autechre, Coil, Bill Laswell, Meat Beat Manifesto and Robin Rimbaud. Harris parted ways with Earache after the Logghi Barogghi release, both sides having been unhappy with how the project was being handled.
Many fans of his drumming were confused by the contrast in musical style between Napalm Death and Scorn, but Harris saw it as a natural progression, telling Decibel in 2012: ""For the ideas that I had, I needed to make that move. Some people think that it was a crazy move, just as grind was maybe starting to go places, do something, but I’ve always been an experimenter, still am; I’m someone who just loves sound.""
Having left Earache Records, the project kept pushing the heavy bass sound, subtly changing with each release. The downtempo sound gained Harris an underground following and he was seen as an early originator of dubstep. In May 1997, Harris decided to end the project in order to finish relations with KK Records, after they refused to fund a collaboration with Bill Laswell and a rapper. After pursuing other projects, Harris returned with two critically acclaimed Scorn albums on Hymen Records, Greetings from Birmingham and Plan B. Scorn then released a one track live mix called List of Takers in 2004 on Vivo Records.
Scorn returned in 2007 with Stealth on Ad Noiseam with the CD version released on Kurt Gluck's Ohm Resistance label. Scorn then released 12"" records on Combat Records and Record Label Records in 2008. Another full-length album entitled Refuse; Start Fires, again was released on Ohm Resistance in 2010. This album also marked the first time since Bullen left the project that Harris has worked full-on with another musician (excluding the track Scorn did with David Knight on the ""Rise|Converge"" compilation), drummer Yan Treasey. On the heels of this full-length, Harris returned with the ""Yozza"" EP in 2011, again with Treasey.
In November 2011, Harris stated the Scorn project was ""put to bed"".

Relaunch
On 17 January 2019, the Ohm Resistance label announced that Scorn was back and would release an EP in early 2019, with an album to follow. The EP of four new tracks, was called Feather. The full-length album, Cafe Mor, was released in November and featured a collaboration with Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods. Daniele Antezza of Dadub mastered the album. Harris intended to tour in 2020 with a new Akai MPC liveset but was forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He then released a studio album, The Only Place in 2021, with one track featruing a collaboration with Kool Keith.

Shpongle,"Shpongle is a psychedelic electronic music project from England that formed in 1996.  The group includes Hallucinogen and Raja Ram (one of three in The Infinity Project). The duo are considered to be one of the progenitors of the psybient genre — a genre combining world music with psychedelic trance and ambient. Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is ""like nothing you've ever heard before.""
Shpongle's first track, ""Vapour Rumours"", was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released in 1998 on Twisted Records. On 9 September 2014, Posford confirmed beginning work on a sixth album, which was released as Codex VI on 23 October 2017. On 3 October 2017, even before the release of Codex VI, the duo announced via a Facebook video that they have begun working on their seventh studio album. Since 30 June 2017, the duo have also been releasing remasters of their previous albums, focussing on releasing special edition vinyl records.
Posford is generally responsible for the synthesizers, studio work, and live instrumentation, while Raja Ram contributes broad musical concepts and flute arrangements. Raja Ram stated in an interview that ""Shpongle"" is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness. For example, the track ""A New Way to Say 'Hooray'"" contains a vocal sample of Terence McKenna describing the effects of DMT.

Shpongle live
Shpongle has played several live concerts, and Simon Posford tours frequently, performing live DJ sets.  Raja Ram has occasionally accompanied these sets with live flute performances. Shpongle's first live performance was at the Solstice Music Festival at Motosu Highland in Japan in July 2001. They returned to Japan on New Year's Eve 2003 to play the New Maps of Hyperspace event at Tokyo Bay NK Hall together with 1200 Micrograms (featuring Raja Ram) and Hallucinogen.
Prior to the release of their fourth album Shpongle played a sold out live concert at The Roundhouse venue in Chalk Farm, North London on 31 October 2008. The band featured Andy Gangadeen (drums), Nogera (percussion), Chris Taylor (bass), Pete Callard (guitar), Harry Escott (cello), and Dick Trevor (keyboards and programming); Michele Adamson and Hari Om (voices), three dancers, and for one song only (""Nothing is Something Worth Doing"") Manu Delago on hand pan.
This was followed on 20 December 2008 by a concert in Moscow featuring the same lineup. Shows were also planned for 7 and 9 March 2009 in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, but these were cancelled due to non-payment of the deposit by the promoters.

In 2009, Shpongle played a headlining date at the Ozora Festival held near Ozora, Hungary on 15 August; Shpongle also played a latenight DJ set at Rothbury Festival in Rothbury, Michigan over Fourth of July weekend and two album launch shows at the Roundhouse on 30 and 31 October. The duo returned to Moscow to play at Milk on 12 December 2009.
On 3 August 2010, they opened the Ozora festival in Hungary. This was their tenth documented live performance.
In January 2011, Shpongle toured Australia, playing dates at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, the Enmore Theatre in Sydney, and headlining the Rainbow Serpent Festival in Victoria, Australia.
In June 2011, Shpongle played at the Electric Forest Festival with the Shpongletron.
New unreleased material from the forthcoming album was incorporated in the 2011 tour, the Shpongletron Experience. The tour featured the Shpongletron, designed by visual artist Zebbler. The Shpongletron included a DJ booth and multiple custom-made, video-mapped projection surfaces.
""Shpongle Live"" performed at Camp Bisco X on 8 July 2011 in Mariaville, New York. This was Shpongle's first ever performance as a full ensemble in the United States and was greatly received by fans and newcomers alike.  The band also performed two sold-out American shows on Halloween weekend in 2011, playing at the Hammerstein Ballroom in 
New York City on 28 October, and at the Fox Oakland Theater in Oakland, California on 29 October. They debuted the first track from Museum of Consciousness, called ""Brain in a Fish Tank,"" on 28 October 2011.
For 2012, Shpongle toured the United States performing DJ sets entitled ""Shpongle presents The Masquerade"". The last set of this tour was performed on 31 October 2012, at Terminal West in Atlanta, Georgia. On 3 November, they performed with Younger Brother, Hallucinogen, and other Twisted Records artists. Their set included live keyboards and flute, and debuted many new tracks from their most recent album.
After the ceremony in 2010, on 6 August 2013 Shpongle is once again opening O.Z.O.R.A. Festival with a world premier concert for their new material called Museum of Consciousness (2013).
Oct. 2013 full band live in London at the Troxy. The show was filmed and is available on DVD, released in 2015.
Shpongle played live with a full 12 piece band at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, on 10 May 2014. The concert was filmed, and released on 23 October 2015 as Shpongle - Live at Red Rocks.
On 19 November 2014, it was announced via social media that Shpongle would once again begin touring in the United States throughout early 2015, featuring Phutureprimitive as special guest, the return of ""Shpongletron 3.1,"" and with visuals by Zebbler.
On 21 September 2018, Shpongle announced their last full public concerts, two consecutive nights at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 3/4 May 2019:

Although this is their last full public concert, Shpongle will continue to enchant and delight with future studio recordings and album releases, with some Shpongle 7 productions receiving their world premieres at this performance.

Sigur Rós,"Sigur Rós (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈsɪːɣʏrous] ) is an Icelandic post-rock band that formed in 1994 in Reykjavík. It comprises lead vocalist and guitarist Jón Þór ""Jónsi"" Birgisson, bassist Georg Hólm and keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson. Known for their ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi's falsetto vocals, and their use of bowed guitar, Sigur Rós incorporate classical and minimal aesthetic elements. Jónsi's vocals are sung in Icelandic and non-linguistic vocalisations the band terms Vonlenska. They have released eight studio albums, and attracted critical and commercial attention with their second album Ágætis byrjun.

History
1997–1998: Von and Von brigði
Jón Þór ""Jónsi"" Birgisson (guitar and vocals), Georg Hólm (bass) and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson (drums) formed Sigur Rós in Reykjavík in January 1994. The band's name, which means ""Victory Rose"", is taken from the name of Jónsi's younger sister, Sigurrós, born a few days before the band was formed. 
Sigur Rós signed a record deal with the Icelandic Sugarcubes-owned record label Bad Taste, because they thought the falsetto vocals would appeal to teenage girls. In 1997, they released Von and in 1998 a remix collection, Von brigði. The band was joined by Kjartan Sveinsson on keyboards in 1998. He is the only member of Sigur Rós with musical training, and contributed most of the orchestral and string arrangements for their later work.

1999–2001: Ágætis byrjun
International acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis byrjun. The album's reputation spread by word of mouth over the following two years. Soon critics worldwide were praising it effusively, and the band drew praise from high-profile acts such as Radiohead, Coldplay and David Bowie.
Three songs, ""Ágætis byrjun"", ""Svefn-g-englar"", and a live take, from a 2000 concert in Denmark, of the then-unreleased ""Njósnavélin"" (later 'unnamed' ""Untitled #4"") appeared in the Cameron Crowe film Vanilla Sky. The former two also subsequently appeared in the US version of the television series Queer as Folk. Their music has also appeared in the TV series 24 with ""Ný batterí"", and CSI with ""Svefn-g-englar"". In 2004, Wes Anderson used ""Starálfur"" in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou as did the Emmy-winning 2005 TV film The Girl in the Café. In Enki Bilal's Immortel (Ad Vitam) the song ""Hjartað hamast (bamm bamm bamm)"" is used. The song ""Svefn-g-englar"" was also used on V on 24 November 2009, and features prominently in Café de Flore released in 2011.
After the release of Ágætis byrjun, the band became known for Jónsi's signature style of reverb accentuated guitar work using a cello's bow.

2001–2004: ( )
In 2001, Sigur Rós christened their newly completed studio by recording an EP titled Rímur with an Icelandic fisherman named Steindór Andersen. The EP contains six songs, all of which feature Steindór Andersen reciting traditional Icelandic rímur poetry. Sigur Rós accompany him on three songs. Two songs feature Steindór alone. The last song on the EP, ""Lækurinn"", is a duet with Sigurður Sigurðarson. A thousand copies of the EP were printed and sold during the spring tour of 2001. The EP was sold in a blank-white-paper case. In 2001 the band toured in Canada, performing at Massey Hall in Toronto in September.
Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason. In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. All of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in Vonlenska, also known as Hopelandic, a language without semantic meaning, which resembles the phonology of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.
In 2002, the band also wrote an original score for the Bodyscript dance production by Wayne McGregor Random Dance in collaboration with Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Arts Council England.
In October 2003, Sigur Rós and Radiohead both composed music for Merce Cunningham's dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós's three tracks were released on the March 2004 EP Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do. Radiohead's contribution was not commercially released. Sigur Rós' 1997 debut album Von found a US and UK release in October 2004.
""Untitled 3"" (a.k.a. Samskeyti) from the album is used on the video 6AM by film maker Carmen Vidal, winner of the 2006 Student Academy Award.
""Untitled 3"" is also used at the end credits of the indie drama movie, Mysterious Skin. It can also be heard in Skins and CSI: Miami and the British TV Documentary Protecting Our Children as well as during a section of the London 2012 summer Olympics on the BBC. It can also be heard in the climactic scene of Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga on Netflix. ""Untitled 4"" from the album (also called ""Njósnavélin"") featured in the final scene of Vanilla Sky, and director Cameron Crowe commented, ""We struggled to find an appropriate track to end the film with and then I went to see Sigur Rós perform in Los Angeles and they played this song, ""Njósnavélin"", that was just perfect. I had to have it."" This track is also featured on Canadian TV series Orphan Black in episode 10 of season 3.

2005–2006: Takk...
Their fourth album, Takk... employs the distinctive sound of their second album in a more rock oriented structure with greater use of the guitar, and was released in September 2005. ""Hoppípolla"", the second official single from Takk..., was released in November alongside a new studio remake of ""Hafsól"", a song that was previously released on the band's 1997 debut, Von. ""Hoppípolla"" was used in the trailers for the BBC's natural history series Planet Earth in 2006, as well as the closing credits for the 2006 FA Cup final, ITV's coverage of the 2006 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, advertisements for the BBC's coverage of England games during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, on television advertisements for RTÉ's Gaelic games coverage in Ireland, and on an advertisement for Oxfam. It was also used in the final scene of the movie Penelope, for the trailer of the film Children of Men and for the trailer of the film Slumdog Millionaire. Following this, demand for the single grew. It was made more widely available by EMI in consequence. This song is also used in the trailer for the Disney movie Earth as well as in the 2011 film We Bought a Zoo. Whilst it does not appear on the film's soundtrack Album, it is also featured in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga.
An extended Sæglópur EP was released in July 2006 in most parts of the world and in August in the United States. Its original release was scheduled in May, but because of the sudden demand of ""Hoppípolla"" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs to appear on the EP (""Refur"", ""Ó friður"", and ""Kafari""). In July 2006, Sigur Rós finished a major world tour with stops in Europe, the United States (where they played a headline show at the Hollywood Bowl), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. Upon return to their homeland, Sigur Rós provided a series of free surprise outdoor concerts throughout Iceland in July and August, playing in various venues such as abandoned bunkers and community coffee shops, all of which were included in the 2007 documentary film Heima. They also performed twice in the United States in February.

2007: Heima and Hvarf/Heim
In August 2007, a limited DVD+CD edition of the 2002 soundtrack to the documentary Hlemmur was released. Hvarf/Heim was released on 5 November (6 November in the U.S.), a double compilation album containing studio versions of previously unreleased songs — ""Salka"", ""Hljómalind"" (formerly known as ""Rokklagið""), ""Í Gær"" and ""Von"" on Hvarf, and acoustic studio versions of the songs: ""Samskeyti"", ""Starálfur"", ""Vaka"", ""Ágætis Byrjun"", ""Heysátan"" and ""Von"", on Heim. On the same day (20 November in the U.S.) Heima, a live DVD of the previous summer's Iceland tour, was released. Just prior to the release of Hvarf/Heim, on 29 October, a single named ""Hljómalind"" was released.
The 2007 feature-length documentary from Sigur Rós's summer tour in Iceland, which occurred in 2006, attempts to shed light on the band's homeland. Therefore, the film is called ""Heima"", which means ""at home"". In the movie, the band members express their interpretation of ""Iceland"". The film revolves around three main elements; the band playing live, the Icelandic nature shaping their music, along with interviews, where they tell the viewers what it was like to play at home in addition to sharing their overall experience of the tour.
To promote their film Heima, the band scheduled a series of premiere screenings throughout the world, featuring a short acoustic set before the film and a question-and-answer session afterwards.

2008: Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust
Sigur Rós's fifth regular studio album, Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust, was released in June 2008 to generally positive reviews. Stylistically different from their earlier releases, it featured fewer strings and more guitar, and had more pop-oriented songs, making it ""the group's most accessible effort"" while maintaining the ""majestic beauty that defines the band's music."" The final track ""All Alright"" is the band's first to be sung in English, though all the other lyrics are in Icelandic.

The band were announced as a headlining act for the 2008 Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay, Australia, Latitude Festival 2008, and the 2008 La Route du Rock Festival in St Malo, France. In addition, the band performed a late-night set at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, where they blew a speaker at the end of their second song. Jónsi Birgisson commented, ""The piano is exploding, I think,"" one of the few things spoken in English.
The band released the first song from the album titled ""Gobbledigook"" for free on their website, along with a music video.
On 8 June, the whole album was made available for free streaming on their website.
In autumn 2008 Sigur Rós embarked on a world tour supporting their newly released album. The band played as a four-piece without Amiina and the brass band, the first time the band had played as a four-piece in seven years. The tour started on 17 September 2008 in the United States, at the United Palace Theater in New York City, and finished with a concert in Reykjavík at Laugardalshöll on 23 November 2008. The majority of the tour was European with the exception of concerts in the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan.
The track ""Festival"" from the album features in the score of the 2010 film 127 Hours, providing the euphoric backing to the climax of the movie. It is also featured at the end of HBO mini-series ""24/7 – Flyers-Rangers"".
The track ""Untitled #7 (Dauðalagið)"" was also featured in the launch trailer for Dead Space.

2009–2012: Hiatus, Inni, Valtari
In 2009, Jónsi embarked on a solo adventure with his first solo album Go, released the next year.
On 28 May 2009, Sigur Rós announced that they had almost completed recording their latest album. The band said the album was taking form as a slower and more ambient record than both Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust and Takk.... The music was also described as melodic but much less noisy and more ""out there"" than previous albums. The unnamed album was expected to be released sometime in 2010. However, the band later revealed that the recordings had been scrapped. In a 2010 interview, Jónsi confirmed ""We haven't got another album ready"", he said. ""It was just a rumour. We started to record something, but then we chucked it all away. So I think we are going to have to start it all again"". Without further word on the new album, Sigur Rós were rumoured to be on indefinite hiatus as of January 2010. However, before taking the stage at Coachella in April 2010, Jónsi commented that Sigur Rós would be getting back to work that year: ""I'm gonna record some other stuff with Sigur Rós when I'm home"", between a series of shows during his solo tour in summer 2010. On 1 February 2011, Jónsi's official website announced that he would be back in the studio with the band over the spring.
On 11 August 2011 Sigur Rós's official website unveiled a trailer for a project called Inní, a DVD and double CD of the band's live performances in London, directed by Vincent Morisset. It was screened at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, and saw official release in November 2011. On 16 September 2011, the Inni album and live video became available to pre-order from the band's site in a variety of formats. Additionally, the band made the video for the song ""Festival"" available to watch online, as well as offering a free download of the audio from a live performance of the song.
On 3 November 2011, following the UK premiere of Inni at the British Film Institute in London, the band members participated in a Q&A session during which Georg promised that 2012 would be a ""very busy"" year for Sigur Rós. The band hinted at a new album and tour in the second half of 2012. The Q&A session was curtailed when a stage light began to emit smoke and the room was evacuated.

""The band's next album is scheduled for release in the spring. Based on excerpts presented by Mr. Sveinsson, the new music promises to be as exceptional as the best of the band's catalog. Mr. Holm called it ""introverted"", while Mr. Birgisson said it was ""floaty and minimal"". ""An ambient album"" was how Mr. Dýrason described it, with ""a slow takeoff toward something"". For a visitor who heard a preliminary recording in which Mr. Birgisson's falsetto was surrounded by rich choral voices and what sounded like a pipe organ, the music was thrilling"".
Beginning in February 2012, Sigur Rós announced their live return with festival appearances at Bestival in England, Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, and other shows in Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Poland, and Italy. The band was also added to Montréal's Osheaga 2012 lineup, and the 2012 Lollapalooza lineup.
After a four-year hiatus, an interview with the band in the March 2012 issue of Q magazine confirmed the completion of a new album, titled Valtari, scheduling its release on 28 May 2012. On 26 March 2012, the band released the first official single from the album, ""Ekki múkk."" On 14 April 2012, a lower quality version of the complete album leaked out on the internet. On 10 May 2012, Sigur Rós's new track ""Dauðalogn"" was premiered on ""The Departed"", the season 3 finale of The Vampire Diaries.
It was rumored that an already-complete additional album would follow-up their sixth release, Valtari. However, the band has dismissed the rumor as a ""fabrication"".
On 2 November 2012, Georg Hólm confirmed that the band had already started work on a new album, due to be released some time in 2013. He described it as a dramatic change of direction, ""an anti-Valtari"". The band performed a new song, entitled ""Brennisteinn"" ('brimstone'), in Reykjavík on 4 November at the Iceland Airwaves 2012 festival, to favourable reception. On 12 November 2012, the band announced a new North American tour, to take place in March and April 2013. The band also announced that every ticket purchased will include a new digital copy of a three-track EP, containing new and unreleased music, made available to ticket holders on 22 March 2013.

2013–2019: Kveikur and departures of Kjartan and Orri
On 24 January 2013, Sigur Rós announced in a Q&A on Reddit that Kjartan had left the band, feeling it was time ""to do something different"". They announced their seventh studio album, Kveikur, on 22 March. On the same day, they also released the album's first single: ""Brennisteinn"". The album was released on 14 June (releasing two days earlier in Japan, and four days later in the US) and marked both a musical and thematic change for the band, providing a more aggressive sound, compared to their previous albums. The album was well received by critics, scoring 80 on Metacritic, with several reviewers praising for the band's new musical approach, as well as a lack of commercialism. The release was marked, by the band, with a new tour, as well as an interactive musical experience, where fans could live stream a concert, taking control of the camera. The band later performed at the iTunes Festival, on 2 September 2013, where selected portions of their concert were later released on 21 October.
The band provided original music and a rendition of ""The Simpsons Theme"", as well as a brief cameo, for the Simpsons episode ""The Saga of Carl"", which aired on 19 May 2013.
The band appeared in the HBO TV series Game of Thrones episode ""The Lion and the Rose"" on 13 April 2014. They also covered the song ""The Rains of Castamere"", which was originally recorded by the National for the earlier episode ""Blackwater"".
Georg and Orri worked with Georg's brother Kjartan Dagur ""KD"" Hólm and the composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson on the soundtrack to The Show of Shows: 100 Years of Vaudeville, Circuses and Carnivals. This was released as an album, Circe – Music Composed for The Show of Shows, on the Krunk label in the UK on 28 August 2015.
A reissue of the band's second album, Ágætis byrjun, was announced in early 2015. It was announced to feature previously unheard studio and live recordings as well as photographic and documentary material from their personal archives.
On 31 January 2017 it was announced that the band would be touring later in 2017, playing concerts in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
The band, in collaboration with Alex Somers, produced two instrumental pieces, ""End"" and ""Match"", for the Black Mirror season four episode ""Hang the DJ"", aired on 29 December 2017.
On 8 May 2018, the band released a new multimedia project called Liminal, which they described as an ""endless mixtape"" of ambient music which will be continuously added to over time. In addition, Jónsi, Somers, and frequent collaborator Paul Corley announced a series of ""live soundbaths,"" where the music would be played in front of an audience.
In September 2018, Orri was accused of sexual assault by artist Meagan Boyd. On 1 October 2018, he announced that he had decided to leave the band ""in light of the scale of this matter"". In March 2019, Sigur Rós were charged with tax evasion, accused of having submitted incorrect tax returns from 2011 to 2014, evading 151m Icelandic krona. The band members blamed their former accountant and said they were co-operating with the authorities. The case was dismissed in October 2019 but this decision was later overruled by an appellate court. Three members were cleared, but the charges against Jónsi and his company Frakkur proceeded. On March 24, 2023, all charges were dismissed.

2020–present: Kjartan rejoins and Átta
In October 2020, the band announced that a new album, Odin's Raven Magic, an orchestral work that was debuted live in 2002, would be released on 4 December 2020. This album is a live recording of the orchestral piece being performed in Paris in 2004. On 14 February 2022, Sigur Rós announced that Kjartan had rejoined them. The following week, they announced their first world tour in nearly five years. In addition to the tour, it was announced that the band are in the process of writing and recording a new album.
On 16 June 2023, Sigur Rós released ""Blóðberg"", the first single from their eighth studio album, Átta (eight in Icelandic). The self-produced album was recorded at Sundlaugin Studio, on the rural outskirts of Reykjavík.

Vonlenska
Vonlenska (English: Hopelandic) is a term coined by the band to refer to the vocalizations that Jónsi sings on ( ) in lieu of lyrics in Icelandic or English. It takes its name from ""Von"", a song on Sigur Rós's debut album Von where it was first used. However, not all Sigur Rós songs are in Vonlenska; many are sung in Icelandic.
Vonlenska differs from both natural and constructed languages used for human communication. It consists of strings of meaningless syllables containing non-lexical vocables and phonemes. There is no grammatical relation between or among syllables, nor are they accompanied by clearly defined word boundaries. Vonlenska emphasizes the phonological and emotive qualities of human vocalizations, and it uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way, it is similar to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz and puirt à beul in traditional Irish folk music and Scottish. The band's website describes it as ""a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music"".

Space music,"Space music, also called spacemusic or space ambient, is a subgenre of new-age music and is described as ""tranquil, hypnotic and moving"". It is derived from ambient music and is associated with lounge music, easy listening, and elevator music.
According to Stephen Hill, co-founder of a radio show called Hearts of Space, the term is used to describe music that evokes a feeling of contemplative spaciousness. Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within a wide range of genres. Space music may have influences from western classical, world, Celtic, traditional and experimental music.
Hill believes that space music can evoke a ""continuum of spatial imagery and emotion"", which can be beneficial for introspection, and for developing, through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. This type of psychonautic listening can produce a subtle trance-like state in certain individuals which can in turn lead to sensations of flying, floating, cruising, gliding, or hovering.
Hill states that space music is used by some individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to enable states of relaxation, contemplation, inspiration, and generally peaceful expansive moods; it may promote health through relaxation, atmospherics for bodywork therapies, and effectiveness of meditation. Space music appears in many film soundtracks and is commonly played in planetariums.
According to Hill space music is an eclectic music produced almost exclusively by independent labels and it occupies a small niche in the marketplace, supported and enjoyed by a relatively small audience of loyal enthusiastic listeners.

Definitions
AllMusic defines space music as a subgenre of New Age music. Similarly, mainstream retailer Barnes & Noble, independent online music retailer CD Baby, and RealNetwork's music download service Rhapsody all classify space music as a subgenre of new-age music. Rhapsody's editorial staff writes in their music genre description for space music (listed as a subgenre of new-age music) that ""New Age composers have looked upward for inspiration, creating an abstract notion of the sounds of interstellar music.""
Stephen Hill, co-founder of the radio show Music from the Hearts of Space (syndicated nationally in the United States on National Public Radio) uses the phrase ""contemplative music, broadly defined"" as an overview to describe the music played on his station, along with the term ""spacemusic"". He states that the ""genre spans historical, ethnic, and contemporary styles"", and that it combines elements from many cultures and genres, blended with varieties of acoustic and electronic ambient music, ""woven into a seamless sequence unified by sound, emotion, and spatial imagery."" In his essay ""New Age Music Made Simple"", and in introducing the 200th broadcast of the Hearts of Space radio program, Hill has referred to space music as a sub-category of New Age.
Hill's partner Anna Turner (co-host and original co-producer of Music from the Hearts of Space) wrote in her 1989 essay entitled ""Space Music"" that ""New Age Space music carries visions in its notes; it is transcendent inner and outer space music that opens, allows and creates space... this music speaks to our present moment, to the great allegory of moving out beyond our boundaries into space, and reflexively, to the unprecedented adventures of the psyche that await within.""
Gerardo ""Pkx"" Martinez-Casas, original host, producer and creator of KUSF's 90.3 FM, University of San Francisco in California, ""Moondance (The Beyond Within)"" 1981– 198?, described space music as electronic, environmental and spiritual fine art fashion cosmic sounds as an aid and tool for cultural, contemplative, meditative, social and spiritual awareness.
In her book The New Age Music Guide, author, editor and music critic P. J. Birosik classifies space music as a subgenre of new-age music, as does Dallas Smith, writer, teacher and recording artist in his essay New Age Jazz/Fusion. Steven Halpern, noted recording artist and workshop leader writes that space music has been considered a synonym for new-age music: "" 'Space' is a vital dimension of new-age music; so much so that one of the early appellations for the genre was simply 'space music', referring both to its texture and to the state that it tended to evoke in the listener.""
John Diliberto, the host of the radio show, Echoes, and creator of WXPN's Star's End, has stated that space music is related to electronic music, as has Bay Area musician, composer and sound designer Robert Rich, who considers space music to be a combination of Electronic music influences from the 1970s with world music and ""modern compositional methods"".
Forest, host of Musical Starstreams refers to space music as a separate genre along with Ambient music, and others including dub, downtempo, trip hop, and acid jazz in the list of genres he calls ""exotic electronica"". Similarly, WXPN Radio's Star's End, programming ambient music since 1976, on its website lists space music as a separate genre, along with Ambient, new-age, and others.
Steve Sande, freelance writer for the San Francisco Chronicle considers space music to be ""Anything but New Age,"" and writes that ""spacemusic [is] also known as ambient, chill-out, mellow dub, down-tempo.""
In the same article, he describes Stephen Hill's ""Hearts of Space"" spacemusic program as streaming ambient, electronic, world, new-age and classical music. In contrast to this, according to author and National Endowment for the Arts researcher Judith H. Balfe, Billboard editor Jerry Wood describes space music as one of several ""genres within the genre"" of new-age music.

Variety
As described by Stephen Hill, the predominant defining element of spacemusic is its contemplative nature. Within that overview, Hill's definition of space music includes a wide variety of styles, instrumentation and influences – both acoustic or electronic.
Many space music recording artists specialize in electronic forms, evolving out of the traditional Kosmische musik of the Berlin School (also known as Krautrock).
Author and classical music critic David Hurwitz describes Joseph Haydn's choral and chamber orchestra piece, The Creation, composed in 1798, as space music, both in the sense of the sound of the music, (""a genuine piece of 'space music' featuring softly pulsating high violins and winds above low cellos and basses, with nothing at all in the middle ... The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ... ""); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived The Creation after discussing music and astronomy with William Herschel, oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus).

Historical usage of the term
In 1928, the German composer Robert Beyer published a paper about ""Raummusik"" (spatial music), which is an entirely different sense of the term. Karlheinz Stockhausen, who became a colleague of Beyer in Cologne in 1953, used the expression ""space music"" in this sense when describing his early development as a composer: ""The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc., the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) possibilities within sound (also all noises) and the controlled projection of sound in space."" In the sense meant here, he stated in 1967, ""Several have commented that my electronic music sounds 'like on a different star', or 'like in outer space.' Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space."" A number of Stockhausen's later compositions (not all of them electronic music) take outer space as their theme: Sternklang (Star Sound, 1971), Ylem (1972), Sirius (1975–77), several components of the opera-cycle Licht (Weltraum (Outer Space, 1991–92/1994), Michaelion (1997), Komet (Comet, 1994/1999), Lichter—Wasser (Lights—Waters, 1998–99)), and the so-called ""Urantia"" subcycle of Klang (Sound, 2006–2007), extending from its thirteenth ""hour"", Cosmic Pulses to its twenty-first ""hour"" Paradies.
Music historian Joseph Lanza described the emerging light music style during the early 1950s as a precursor to modern space music. He wrote that orchestra conductor Mantovani used new studio technologies to ""create sound tapestries with innumerable strings"" and in particular, ""the sustained hum of Mantovani's reverberated violins produced a sonic vaporizor foreshadowing the synthesizer harmonics of space music.""
Jazz artist Sun Ra used the term to describe his music in 1956, when he stated that the music allowed him to translate his experience of the void of space into a language people could enjoy and understand.
Physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler had been inspired by Homer Dudley's 1948 invention of the Vocoder and began in 1951 to work with a device known as a Melochord, in conjunction with magnetic tape recorders, leading to a decade of working at the Studio for Electronic Music (WDR) specializing in ""elektronische Musik"" using magnetic tape recorders, sine wave generators and serial composition techniques.
In 1969, Miles Davis was introduced to the music of Stockhausen by young arranger and cellist, and later Grammy award winner, Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration for Davis. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that ""The effect of Davis's study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. ... Davis's own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally."" His recordings and performances during this period were described as ""space music"" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster who stated: ""a lot of mood changes – heavy, dark, intense – definitely space music.""
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Grateful Dead developed a new form of improvisational space music in their extended formless jam sessions during live concerts (which their fans referred to as ""Space"" though the band did not formally assign that title), and their experimental space music albums such as Aoxomoxoa, and later in the 1980s, Infrared Roses, and Grayfolded. Band member Phil Lesh released experimental space music recording Seastones with computer music pioneer Ned Lagin in 1975, one of the first albums to be issued in the innovative but commercially unsuccessful format SQ-Quadwith. Lagin used in real-time stage and studio performance of minicomputers driving real-time digital to analog converters, prior to the commercial availability of digital synthesizers in the early 1980s.
The Czech-American composer Václav Nelhýbel, released in 1974 a record named Outer Space: Music by Vaclav Nelybel. From the liner notes: ""Ingenious use of echo, artificial reverberation and electronic alterations gives the music in this category a weird, spooky futuristic, 'out of this world' quality, well-suited to super-natural happenings of any kind. Piano, drums and electronic instruments are used to achieve the strange atmosphere and spatial sounds."" Vaclav Nelhybel crafts a supernatural world, describing nebulae, meteors, star clusters and craters on Mars with sounds natural and manipulated to tell the story of cosmic space.
Beginning in the early 1970s, the term ""space music"" was applied to some of the output of such artists as Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream, due to the transcendent cosmic feelings of space evoked by the sound of the music and enhanced by the use of the emerging new instrument, the synthesizer, and also in part to the ""outer space"" themes that are apparent in some of their works. These space music explorations diverged from traditional pop-song formats into longer less structured compositions. Following their early influence on the development of space music, Tangerine Dream later produced increasingly rock-influenced works that are not generally described as space music.
In 1971–72, Sun Ra brought his ""space music"" philosophy to UC Berkeley where he taught as artist-in-residence for the school year, creating notoriety among the students by devoting the second half-hour of each class to solo or band performances. In 1972, San Francisco public TV station KQED producer John Coney, producer Jim Newman, and screenwriter Joshua Smith worked with Sun Ra to produce a 30-minute documentary film, expanded into a feature film released in 1974, entitled Space Is the Place, featuring Sun Ra's Arkestra and filmed in Golden Gate Park.
In 1973, Berkeley radio producers Anna Turner and Stephen Hill used the phrase in the title of their local public radio show Music from the Hearts of Space. They developed an innovative segue music assembly technique, cross-mixing ""spacey"" instrumental pieces to create a sustained mood. The term began to be used more widely when the show was syndicated nationally in 1983. Other U.S.-based radio programmers adopted the term as well, among them, John Diliberto, Steve Pross, and Gino Wong with Star's End, launched in 1976, Frank J. Forest (a.k.a. ""Forest"") with Musical Starstreams, launched in 1981 and nationally syndicated in 1983, and John Diliberto again with Echoes, launched in 1989.

In film and television soundtracks
Examples of space music in film soundtracks include the Vangelis score to Blade Runner,

Tangerine Dream's moody soundtracks for Legend, Sorcerer and Risky Business,

Jonn Serrie's surround-sound score for the IMAX short film, Hubble: Galaxies Across Space and Time, Brian Eno's score for the 1989 film For All Mankind, and Michael Stearns' soundtrack for the 1985 IMAX film, Chronos, broadcast on Stephen Hill's Hearts of Space radio, on the film's opening night

Television science-fiction series Babylon 5 was scored by former Tangerine Dream member Christopher Franke, released on compact disc in 1996 on Franke's independent label Sonic Images. The scores for many of the Babylon 5 TV movies and numerous Babylon 5 episodes were also released by Sonic Images. In 1994, the German TV station Bayerischer Rundfunk launched the television program Space Night, featuring a constant flow of satellite and space images accompanied by space music programmed by European chill-out-DJ Alex Azary.

Steven Wilson,"Steven John Wilson (born 3 November 1967) is an English musician. He is the founder, guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter of the rock band Porcupine Tree, as well as being a member of several other bands, including Blackfield, Storm Corrosion and No-Man. He is also a solo artist, having released seven solo albums since his solo debut Insurgentes in 2008. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Wilson has made music prolifically and earned critical acclaim. His honours include six nominations for Grammy Awards: twice with Porcupine Tree, once with his collaborative band Storm Corrosion and three times as a solo artist. In 2017, The Daily Telegraph described him as ""a resolutely independent artist"" and ""probably the most successful British artist you've never heard of"".
Wilson is a self-taught composer, producer, audio engineer, guitar and keyboard player, and plays other instruments as needed, including bass guitar, autoharp, hammered dulcimer and flute. His influences and work have encompassed a diverse range of genres including pop, psychedelia, progressive rock and electronic, among others, shifting his musical direction through his albums. His concerts incorporate quadraphonic sound and elaborate visuals. He has worked with artists such as Elton John, Guns N' Roses, XTC, Opeth, Pendulum, Yes, Fish, Marillion, Black Sabbath, and Anathema. He has remixed several classic pop and rock records, such as Tears for Fears' Songs from the Big Chair and The Seeds of Love, Ultravox's Vienna, Jethro Tull's Aqualung, King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King, and Roxy Music's self-titled debut album.
Wilson released his sixth solo album, The Future Bites, on 29 January 2021. A limited edition of a single copy of the album sold on pre-order immediately for £10,000 on Black Friday in November 2020, with all proceeds going to Music Venue Trust to help save UK music venues affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Future Bites 30-track Digital Deluxe version was made available on 27 August 2021, including remixed versions by artists such as Biffy Clyro, Nile Rodgers and Pure Reason Revolution. Wilson's seventh studio album, The Harmony Codex, was released in 29 September 2023.

Biography
Early years
Born in Kingston upon Thames, London, Wilson was raised from age six in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, where he discovered his interest in music around the age of eight. According to Wilson, his life was changed one Christmas when his parents bought presents for each other in the form of LPs. His father and mother received Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon and Donna Summer's Love to Love You Baby, respectively. It was Wilson's affinity for these albums that helped craft his guitar and songwriting abilities. He said, ""In retrospect I can see how they are almost entirely responsible for the direction that my music has taken ever since."" His interest in Pink Floyd led him towards experimental/psychedelic conceptual progressive rock (as exemplified by Porcupine Tree and Blackfield), and Donna Summer's trance-inflected grooves inspired the initial musical approach of No-Man (Wilson's long-running collaboration with fellow musician and vocalist Tim Bowness).
As a child, Wilson was forced to learn the guitar, but he did not enjoy it; his parents eventually stopped paying for lessons. When he was eleven, he found a nylon string classical guitar from his attic and started to experiment with it; in his own words, ""scraping microphones across the strings, feeding the resulting sound into overloaded reel to reel tape recorders and producing a primitive form of multi-track recording by bouncing between two cassette machines"". A year later, his father, who was an electronic engineer, built him his first multi-track tape machine and a vocoder so he could begin experimenting with the possibilities of studio recording.

Early bands
Wilson said his taste in music diverged from his peers in the 1980s:I grew up in the 80s, and it was a pretty bad decade for music. There were some interesting things developing, but everyone I knew wanted to be in Level 42, Simple Minds or U2. I wasn't interested in any of that, so I found solace in the 60s and 70s music that my parents were listening to. And I began to discover this wonderful era, what you'd call the great album era, from 1967 to 1977, from Sgt Pepper through to punk. 
One of Wilson's earliest musical projects was the psychedelic duo Altamont (featuring a 15-year-old Wilson working with synth/electronics player Simon Vockings). Their one and only cassette album, Prayer for the Soul, featured lyrics by English psychedelic scenester Alan Duffy, whose work Wilson would later use on the first two Porcupine Tree albums. Around the same time that Wilson was part of Altamont, he was also in a progressive rock band called Karma, which played live around Hertfordshire and recorded two cassette albums, The Joke's on You (1983) and The Last Man To Laugh (1985). These contained early versions of ""Small Fish"", ""Nine Cats"" and ""The Joke's on You"", which were subsequently resurrected as Porcupine Tree songs.
Wilson went on to join the New Wave/AOR band Pride of Passion as keyboard player, replacing former Marillion keyboard player Brian Jelliman (another former Marillion member, Diz Minnitt, also played in the band). Pride of Passion would later change their name to Blazing Apostles and alter their lineup and approach, finally coming to an end in 1987.

Breakthrough work
In 1986, Wilson launched the two projects that would make his name. The first of these was initially called ""No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man)"", although it would later be renamed ""No-Man."" This began life as a solo Wilson instrumental project blending progressive rock with synth pop, subsequently moving towards art-pop when singer/lyricist Tim Bowness joined the project the following year. The second project was ""Porcupine Tree"", which was originally intended to be a full-on pastiche of psychedelic rock (inspired by the similar Dukes of Stratosphear project by XTC) carried out for the mutual entertainment of Wilson and his childhood friend Malcolm Stocks.
Over the next three years, the projects would evolve in parallel. Of his two efforts, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) was the first to release a commercial single (1989's ""The Girl From Missouri"", on Plastic Head Records), while Porcupine Tree built an increasing underground reputation via the release of a series of cassette-only releases via The Freak Emporium (the mail-order wing of British psychedelic label Delerium Records).
By 1990, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) had fully evolved into No-Man and was a voice/violin/multi-instrument trio which had incorporated dance beats into its art-pop sound. The second No-Man single – a crooned cover of the Donovan song ""Colours"" arranged in a dub-loop style anticipating trip hop - won the Single of the Week award in Melody Maker and gained the band a recording contract with the high-profile independent label One Little Indian (at the time, famous for the Shamen and Björk). Their debut One Little Indian single, ""Days in the Trees"", won the same Single of the Week award the following year. The single also briefly charted and, although sales were not outstanding, Wilson had now gained credibility in the record industry (as well as enough finance to fit out his home studio with the equipment he would need to advance his music).
By this time, Wilson had also released the official Porcupine Tree debut album, On the Sunday of Life...  (which compiled the best material from the underground tapes). No-Man's debut full-length release – a compilation of EP tracks called Lovesighs – An Entertainment – followed in 1992, as did Porcupine Tree's infamous LSD-themed maxi-single ""Voyage 34"" which made the NME indie chart for six weeks. No-Man also toured England with a six-piece band including three ex-members of the art-pop band Japan – Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and (most significantly) keyboardist Richard Barbieri. 1993 saw Wilson consolidating his initial success with albums from both Porcupine Tree (Up the Downstair) and No-Man (Loveblows And Lovecries – A Confession).
Porcupine Tree, meanwhile, toured frequently and passed through various overt phases of different musical stylings (including psychedelia, progressive rock, modern guitar rock and heavy metal) while retaining the core of Wilson's sonic imagination and songwriting. By the mid-2000s Porcupine Tree had become a well known rock band with albums on major labels such as Atlantic and Roadrunner.

Diversification and collaborations
During the late 1990s, Wilson's love of experimental, drone and ambient music led to a series of new projects, notably Bass Communion and Incredible Expanding Mindfuck (also known as IEM). He also began to release a series of CD singles under his own name.
Having established himself as a producer, Wilson was invited to produce other artists, notably the Norwegian artist Anja Garbarek and Swedish progressive-metal band Opeth. Though he claims to enjoy production more than anything else, with the demands of his own projects, he has mostly restricted himself to mixing for other artists in the last few years.
Wilson has written reviews for the Mexican edition of the Rolling Stone magazine. They are all translated into Spanish. Two reviews have been published so far: one for Radiohead's In Rainbows and another for Murcof's 2007 work, Cosmos. He has also contributed to US magazine Electronic Musician. Wilson wrote the foreword for 2010 book Mean Deviation.
Wilson produced and contributed backing vocals, guitar and keyboards for Opeth on the albums Blackwater Park, Deliverance, and Damnation, also contributing lyrics for one song (Death Whispered a Lullaby) in Damnation. In addition to this, he has collaborated on many projects with Belgian experimental musician Dirk Serries of Vidna Obmana and Fear Falls Burning, most notably on their collaboration project Continuum which has so far produced two albums. Wilson is also featured on a Fovea Hex EP Allure (Part 3 of the ""Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent"" trilogy of EP's) on bass guitar. This EP was released in April 2007 through Die-Stadt Musik.
Wilson has also worked with a range of other artists, including OSI, JBK, Orphaned Land, Paatos, Theo Travis, Yoko Ono, Fish, Cipher and Anja Garbarek, by performing songwriting duties as well as performing musically. Wilson is featured on the Pendulum album Immersion, with his vocals featuring on ""The Fountain"". He made a guest appearance on Dream Theater's 2007 album, Systematic Chaos on the song ""Repentance"", as one of several musical guests recorded apologizing to important people in their lives for wrongdoings in the past.
Wilson did an interview with German musician and composer Klaus Schulze. Schulze was an important figure of the Krautrock movement. This interview is featured as bonus material in Schulze's Live DVD, Rheingold.
Wilson has become known for his 5.1 surround sound mixes, with the 2007 Porcupine Tree album Fear of a Blank Planet nominated for a Grammy Award in the ""Best Mix For Surround Sound"" category. It was also voted #3 album of the year by Sound And Vision. Wilson has worked on several other surround sound projects, which have included remixing the Jethro Tull and King Crimson back catalogues, as well as Marillion's 1985 album Misplaced Childhood. The Anathema album We're Here Because We're Here was mixed by Wilson and he is thanked in the album liner notes, and he mixed two songs on their subsequent album Distant Satellites. He also did the remix for In the Land of Grey and Pink by Canterbury scene band Caravan. The first three new editions were issued in October 2009, with more emerging in batches over the coming years. Wilson is responsible for the 5.1 and new stereo mixes of the 1992 XTC album Nonsuch in 2013, as well as the Gentle Giant albums The Power and the Glory and Octopus in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2018, he released Yes: The Steven Wilson Remixes consisting of Yes albums The Yes Album (1971), Fragile (1971), Close to the Edge (1972), the double album Tales From Topographic Oceans (1973), and Relayer (1974).

Solo career
2003–2010: Cover Version
Between 2003 and 2010, Wilson released a series of six two-track CD singles under his own name. Each single featured a cover version and an original song - or, in one case, a Wilson arrangement of a traditional song. It featured songs by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, Swedish pop group ABBA, English rock band the Cure, Scottish songwriter Momus, American musician Prince, and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan.
Separate from the Cover Versions series, Wilson has also contributed a cover version of the Cardiacs song ""Stoneage Dinosaurs"". The song was featured on Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute to Tim Smith, Songbook 1, which is a fundraising compilation album released in December 2010 to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs leader Tim Smith, whom Wilson has cited as a major inspiration spiritually, if not necessarily in style.
The complete collection of the cover version songs was released as an album titled Cover Version in 2014.

2008–2009: Debut solo album Insurgentes
In November 2008, Wilson released his first official solo album, Insurgentes, recorded between January–August 2008. The album was first released as two limited edition versions, both with hardback book featuring the images of longtime collaborator Danish photographer Lasse Hoile. A standard retail version was released on 9 March 2009.
Lasse Hoile's full-length feature version of the film based on the recording of the album was premiered at the CPH:DOX international film festival in Copenhagen in November 2009. The film was also screened at film festivals in Canada, Germany, Mexico, Sweden and United States. The film is described as part documentary, part surreal road movie. Hoile also directed a video for the song ""Harmony Korine"" from the album. The video was a homage to European art house films, and has been nominated for ""Best Cinematography Award"" and ""Best Music Video Award"" at Camerimage.
A remix mini album was released in June 2009, featuring remixes of material from Insurgentes by David A. Sitek, Dälek, Engineers, Pat Mastelotto and Fear Falls Burning.

2010–2012: Grace for Drowning, Get All You Deserve live concert film
Wilson's second solo album, Grace for Drowning, was released in September 2011 in CD, vinyl and Blu-ray formats. It is a double album, with the individual parts named Deform to Form a Star and Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye. Wilson also announced his first solo tour in Europe and North America to promote his solo albums. The tour took place in October and November 2011 and contained songs from both Insurgentes and Grace for Drowning. A live video performance recorded in Mexico titled Get All You Deserve was released on 25 September 2012.
On 16 December 2011, Wilson announced new European tour dates for the second leg of his Grace for Drowning tour, running in April and May 2012. South American dates were later added and announced on 21 February 2012. He also won the ""Guiding Light"" title at the Progressive Music Awards in 2012.

2013–2014: The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)
Wilson's third solo studio album, recorded with most of the members of the touring band for Grace for Drowning was released on 25 February 2013. Alan Parsons engineered the sessions in Los Angeles. The album reached the top 30 in the UK, and number 3 in the German album charts. In October 2012, Wilson announced the first leg of the supporting tour, consisting of 18 shows across Europe and 17 shows across North America between March–May 2013. For these shows, Chad Wackerman (best known for his work with Frank Zappa) replaced Marco Minnemann on drums due to conflicting schedules. The second leg of the tour from October–November 2013 covered Australia and Europe, and included a sold-out show at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The song ""The Raven That Refused to Sing"" was featured in the trailer for the 2014 film Pompeii. The album finished top of several critics and readers polls, including UK Prog magazine and German magazine Eclipsed. The album was voted album of the year at the 2013 Progressive Music Awards. On 13 July 2015 The Prog Report ranked the album as #2 on their top prog albums of the last 25 years.

2015–2016: Hand. Cannot. Erase.
Wilson's fourth solo album, Hand. Cannot. Erase., was released on 27 February 2015. It was inspired by a documentary about Joyce Carol Vincent, a young British woman who lay dead in her apartment for nearly three years before being discovered. Hand. Cannot. Erase. received critical acclaim from music critics. The Guardian rated the album five stars and called it ""a smart, soulful and immersive work of art"". Eclipsed magazine described the album as ""one more shining jewel in the discography of Steven Wilson"" and Metal Hammer awarded Hand. Cannot. Erase. 6/7 and described it as ""another masterpiece"". US website FDRMX rated the album 4.8/5 and stated ""Hand. Cannot. Erase. grabs your full attention from the beginning to the very final note, and that's the sign of a great album"". The supporting tour spanned from March to June 2015 and consisted of 31 shows in Europe and a total of 34 shows in North and South America. In September, two special shows took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Due to the Aristocrats' tour, for the American shows Guthrie Govan and Marco Minnemann were replaced by Dave Kilminster and Craig Blundell, respectively.

2017–2018: To the Bone
On 12 December 2016, Wilson began recording his fifth solo studio album with engineer Paul Stacey in London. With the departure of most of the members of his solo band from the prior two albums, Wilson handled most of the guitar on the album, with Craig Blundell and Jeremy Stacey both contributing drums. Ninet Tayeb was featured on additional vocals and had a bigger role than she did on Hand. Cannot. Erase. Andy Partridge of XTC revealed that he co-wrote two songs for the album. On 5 January 2017, Wilson posted a teaser clip of himself and Ninet Tayeb recording a new song titled ""Pariah"". In April 2017, Wilson announced that he had switched record labels for the release, with the album to be released on Caroline International. Wilson also mentioned that harmonica player Mark Feltham is going to be playing on the next record and released a clip of him contributing to a song titled ""To the Bone"". Slovak musician David Kollar featured on three songs of the new record.
On 9 May 2017, the album was officially unveiled as To the Bone and released on 18 August 2017. Wilson embarked on major tours of the UK, Europe and North America in 2018 and 2019 to promote the album. For the tour, Alex Hutchings was introduced to replace Dave Kilminster as the guitarist of the live band, as the latter would go on to work in Roger Waters' band.
On 12 September 2018, a live album was announced via his official Instagram account under the name Home Invasion: In Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and it was released on 2 November 2018.

2019–2021: The Future Bites
On 26 May 2019, Wilson confirmed on his Instagram account that the writing and recording process on his sixth studio album was underway. It was expected to be released in 2020. The album was produced by David Kosten, who is also known as Faultline, making the upcoming album Wilson's second to not be produced by him alone. On 21 October 2019, Wilson announced 'The Future Bites Tour', his largest and most ambitious show to date. The Future Bites Tour was planned to be performed in large arenas in the UK, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Poland in September 2020. On 24 December 2019, Wilson announced that his as yet untitled sixth studio album was close to completion and promised further news in early 2020.
On 5 March 2020, Wilson began a teaser campaign across his online channels, centering on modern themes of consumerism, product branding and manipulative social media. A few days later, artwork for ""Personal Shopper"" was unveiled with a release date of 12 March 2020 at 9am GMT. On 12 March 2020, Wilson announced that his sixth solo album The Future Bites would be released on 12 June 2020. The first single to be taken from the album, ""Personal Shopper"" (featuring a spoken word appearance by Elton John), was released the same day.
On 22 April 2020, Wilson announced that the release date of The Future Bites would be pushed back to 29 January 2021, due to logistical/creative challenges facing the music industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In May 2020, Wilson launched 'The Album Years', an audio only podcast with his partner in No-Man, Tim Bowness. It was very successful upon release, charting highly all around the world on Apple Podcasts.
On 22 September 2020, Wilson relaunched The Future Bites with a revised album tracklist and the release of a new single, ""Eminent Sleaze"", along with the release of a video produced by Crystal Spotlight. On 29 October 2020, Wilson released a video for ""King Ghost"", the third single to be taken from The Future Bites. This was directed by Wilson's longtime video collaborator Jess Cope.
On 24 November 2020, Wilson released ""12 Things I Forgot"", the fourth single from The Future Bites. The release of ""12 Things I Forgot"" was accompanied with an announcement that a completely unique, one of one limited edition of The Future Bites would be sold on 27 November 2020 for £10,000, with all proceeds going to Music Venue Trust to help save UK music venues affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This edition of the album sold immediately after going on sale.

2021–present: The Harmony Codex
On 22 March 2021, Wilson announced that due to uncertainty surrounding live performances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, The Future Bites Tour (scheduled to begin in September 2021) would be cancelled. Wilson stated that he will now concentrate on upcoming music projects, including his seventh studio album, a conceptual work entitled The Harmony Codex that is planned for release in mid-2023. Wilson also revealed an autobiography, Limited Edition of One, which was published by Little, Brown and Company on 7 April 2022. In his 2023 new year's message, Wilson stated that The Harmony Codex is to be released on the Virgin Music label and will be 65 minutes long. The album was released on 29 September 2023.

Musical projects
Porcupine Tree
Porcupine Tree started out as a duo of Wilson and his school friend Malcolm Stocks (with Wilson providing the majority of the instrumentation and Stocks contributing mostly ideas, additional vocals and experimental guitar sounds). Wilson began experimenting by recording music in his home until he had the hunch it could become someway marketable. The material was subsequently compiled into three demo tapes (Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, Love, Death & Mussolini and The Nostalgia Factory). For the first tape, he even wrote an inlay introduction to an obscure (imaginary) band called ""The Porcupine Tree"", suggesting the band met in the early '70s at a rock festival, and they had been in and out of prison many times. The booklet also contained information about band's obscure members like Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones, and crew members like Linton Samuel Dawson (if put into initials forming LSD). Wilson: ""It was a bit of fun. But of course like anything that starts as a joke, people started to take it all seriously!"". When Wilson signed to Delerium label, he selected what he considered the best tracks from these early tapes. All those songs were mastered and made up Porcupine Tree's first official studio album, On the Sunday of Life....
Quickly after, Wilson would release the single ""Voyage 34"", a thirty-minute long piece that could be described as a mixture of ambient, trance and psychedelia. This was done partly as an attempt to produce the longest single yet released, which it was until it was later exceeded by The Orb's ""Blue Room."" With non-existent radio play ""Voyage 34"" still managed to enter the NME indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic.
The second full-length album, Up the Downstair (though Wilson considers it the first 'proper' PT album since it was made as such and not simply compiled), was released in 1993 and had a very good reception, praised by Melody Maker as ""a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year"". This was the first album to include ex-Japan member, keyboardist Richard Barbieri and Australian-born bassist Colin Edwin. About the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a full band for the first time with the inclusion of Chris Maitland on drums.
Wilson continued exploring the ambient and trance grounds and issued The Sky Moves Sideways. It also entered the NME, Melody Maker, and Music Week charts and many fans started hailing them as the Pink Floyd of the nineties, something Wilson would reject: ""I can't help that. It's true that during the period of The Sky Moves Sideways, I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums anymore. Moreover, I regret it.""
The band's fourth work, Signify, included the first full-band compositions and performance, which resulted in less use of drum machines and a more full-band sound. It can be considered a departure from its predecessors for a more song-oriented style. After the release of the live album Coma Divine concluded their deal with Delerium in 1997, the band moved to Snapper and issued two poppier albums, Stupid Dream in 1999 and Lightbulb Sun in 2000.
Two years would pass until their seventh studio album, and in the meantime the band switched labels again, this time signing to the major label Lava. Drummer Chris Maitland was also replaced by Gavin Harrison. In Absentia was released in 2002, featuring a heavier sound than all the group's previous works. It charted in many European countries and remains one of the top-selling Porcupine Tree albums to date. The 2004 special edition was also their first record to be released in 5.1 Surround Sound, winning the ""Best Made-For-Surround Title"" award from the Surround Music Awards 2004 shortly afterwards.
In 2005, Porcupine Tree released Deadwing, a record inspired by a film script written by Steven Wilson and his friend Mike Bennion. This became the first Porcupine Tree album to chart on the Billboard 200, entering at #132. The album won Classic Rock magazine's ""album of the year"" award and its surround version received the ""Best Made-For-Surround Title"" once again.

Wilson started writing Porcupine Tree's next album in early 2006 in Tel Aviv, Israel, alongside work on the second album for his side-project Blackfield. Writing sessions finished in London, UK, in June 2006. In August of the same year the band released their first live DVD, titled Arriving Somewhere..., and started a tour between September and November to promote it; the first half of each show was made up of all-new material. When the tour concluded the band went into the studio and finished recording and mastering the album. In early January 2007, the band revealed the album title was going to be Fear of a Blank Planet (a deliberate reference to Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet) and the concept was influenced by the Bret Easton Ellis novel Lunar Park. The album hit the shops on 16 April 2007 in Europe and 24 April in USA. The lyrics revolve around common 21st Century issues such as technology alienation, teen violence, prescription drugs, attention deficit disorder and bipolar disorder.
Fear of a Blank Planet resulted in the most successful album to date in terms of market and sales, and also received the most favourable reviews of the band's whole career. It entered the Billboard 200 at #59, and charted in almost all European countries, peaking at #31 in the UK. It was nominated for a US Grammy, and won several polls as the best album of the year (e.g. Classic Rock magazine, Aardshock, The Netherlands). In July 2007, the Nil Recurring EP was released, containing material that had been left off the album.
At a European show in August 2008, Wilson said Porcupine Tree was beginning work on material for their next album with an eye toward a release in 2009. This album was later revealed to be titled The Incident. The Incident is a double CD set containing ""The Incident"", a 55-minute ""song cycle"", on the first disc and four shorter songs on the second. It has received significant attention and media coverage and the band achieved their highest chart positions to date, reaching 5 in The Netherlands, 9 in Germany, 23 in the UK and 25 on the Billboard 200 in the USA. The subsequent tour of the US and Europe highlighted a large increase in the band's following, with many shows sold out.  The single from The Incident, ""Time Flies"" was available as a free download from iTunes for one week in October 2009.
In 2010 after this tour, the band became inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects.
The band reformed in 2021 after a 12 year hiatus. The band is now made up of a trio line-up of Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison. The band's former bassist, Colin Edwin, did not return. The reformation was formally revealed on 1 November 2021, with the simultaneous release of the ""Harridan"" single and the announcement of a new studio album, Closure/Continuation, released on 24 June 2022.

No-Man
No-Man is Wilson's long-term collaboration with singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. Influenced by styles from ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations. After a few years the duo started to create more textural and experimental music. Beginning with Flowermouth in 1994, they have worked with a very wide palette of sounds, and many guest musicians, blending balladry with both acoustic and electronic sounds. No-Man was the first Wilson project to achieve any degree of success, signing with UK independent label One Little Indian (the label of Björk, the Shamen and Skunk Anansie among others).
On 22 November 2019, the band released their seventh album, Love You to Bits, their first original recording in 11 years.

I.E.M.
In 1996, the first in a series of albums by I.E.M. (The Incredible Expanding Mindfuck was released, a name which had also been considered for Porcupine Tree in its infancy), dedicated to exploring Wilson's love of krautrock and experimental rock music. Initially, Wilson had planned for the project to be anonymous, but then label Delerium Records published a song on their Pick N Mix compilation with the composition credited to ""Steven Wilson"" and so attempts to pass off the project in this way were abandoned. The project released two more albums Arcadia Son, and IEM Have Come For Your Children, in 2001. A box set of four CDs, consisting of everything Wilson recorded under the name - billed as ""an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M."" - was released in June 2010.

Bass Communion
In 1998, Wilson launched Bass Communion, a project dedicated to recordings in an industrial, ambient, drone, and/or electronic vein. So far there have been several full length Bass Communion CDs, vinyl LPs, and singles, many of them issued in handmade or limited editions.

Blackfield
In 2001, Wilson met and began to collaborate with Israeli rock musician Aviv Geffen, with whom he created the band Blackfield. Since then the duo have released three acclaimed albums of what they refer to as ""melodic and melancholic rock."" The albums spawned several singles, notably ""Blackfield,"" ""Pain"" and ""Once."" A live DVD from a show in New York was released in 2007.  A third album titled ""Welcome to my DNA"" came in March 2011. Later that year Wilson decided to take a secondary role in the band, feeling that with so much of his time and attention devoted to his solo career, there was not enough left for him to properly fill the role of co-leader of Blackfield as well. He still contributed to the band's fourth album in 2013 as singer and producer. Wilson left the band after a short European tour in February 2014 and a final date in New York City on 1 May 2014, due to his increasingly tight schedule with his solo career and upcoming projects. In June 2015 and June 2016, Wilson was seen in recording sessions with Geffen and Alan Parsons. In August 2016, Blackfield announced that their new album, Blackfield V, would mark the return of Wilson to the band in ""full partnership"".
On 13 May 2019, Geffen uploaded a picture to his official Instagram account, revealing that both musicians are currently working on their sixth record.

Storm Corrosion
In March 2010, Wilson and Mikael Åkerfeldt, the front man of Opeth, decided to work on a new project as a collaboration under the name of Storm Corrosion. The self-titled album was released in May 2012 on Roadrunner Records. It has been described as being ""the final part in the odd trilogy of records completed by (Opeth's) Heritage and Steven Wilson's second solo album Grace for Drowning."" They did not tour or play any live shows in support of the album, and while the two have expressed interest in working together again, nothing definite has emerged from this.

Performance style
For live shows, Wilson plays barefoot, a habit that goes back to his early childhood. He said, ""I always had a problem wearing shoes and I've always gone around with bare feet."" He said that another factor in performing barefoot is the advantage it gives in operating his diverse guitar pedals. He has injured his feet as a result: in one of his early shows, he ended up with a syringe inserted in his foot and had to get a tetanus vaccine. He said ""I've stepped on nails, screws, drawing pins, stubbed my toe, I've come off stage with blood just coming out ... I mean, I've had it all mate, but to be honest, nothing's going to stop me."" He later started using a carpet, which reduced the frequency of such incidents.

Influence
In addition to his legacy with Porcupine Tree, some artists have cited Wilson directly as an influence, including Steffen Kummerer of Obscura, Caligula's Horse, Tor Oddmund Suhrke of Leprous, Jonathan Carpenter of The Contortionist, Bilocate, and Alex Vynogradoff of Kauan.
In addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for his solo work, including Alex Lifeson, Steve Howe, Robert Trujillo, Adrian Belew, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, Rob Swire, Seven Lions, Demians (Nicolas Chapel), Jem Godfrey, Jim Matheos, Dan Briggs, Eraldo Bernocchi, and Chantel McGregor.

Personal life
Wilson prefers to keep a low profile, following the example of musicians like Radiohead, Pink Floyd and Tool, but he shares snapshots of his life on Instagram. He shared the news that he married his girlfriend Rotem in September 2019, subsequently sharing the news and a wedding picture on his Instagram page. His wife has two girls from her previous marriage. His family has also set up an Instagram account for their dog Bowie Wilson, named after David Bowie.
Wilson is a vegan and an atheist, and although fascinated by the subject of religion, he is a strong critic of organised religion. He believes in not imposing his views, but to express them through stories and characters, saying, ""I think that is all you can do as an artist. Not preach to your audience but just reflect the world with all its flaws and joys."" He does not smoke and does not use recreational drugs, except for an occasional drink. In a 2016 article he expressed his admiration for Israel and was critical of musicians such as Roger Waters who have boycotted Israel.
In a June 2022 interview with Qobuz alongside Richard Barbieri, he mentioned that Zeit by the German electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream was his favorite album of all time; he called the band the ""birth of ambient music.""

Steven Wilson's discography"
Susumu Hirasawa,"Susumu Hirasawa (平沢進, Hirasawa Susumu, born April 2, 1954) is a Japanese musician and composer. He is well known for his work for the films of director Satoshi Kon and the animated adaptations of the Berserk manga series, alongside his work as a solo artist.

Early life
Hirasawa was born on April 2, 1954, to his father Kiyoshi (平沢 清), a firefighter as well as a calligrapher. Under the penname ""Hōseki"" (峰石), he wrote the names of album and band for the cover art of the P-Model album Potpourri. Hirasawa lived with his older brother, artist Yūichi (平沢 裕一, born October 5, 1950), who goes by the moniker ""YOU1"". He formed a stage effects team for Mandrake and appeared on the band's final show, running on a treadmill. Yūichi was P-Model's art director for the band's first 9 years of existence, and has done occasional artwork for his brother from 2013 onwards. His only musical credits are for writing the lyrics of ""For Kids"" and ""Sunshine City"" (from In a Model Room), and for doing backing vocals on ""Rocket"" (from The Ghost in Science).
Since childhood, Hirasawa had an interest in machinery, and thought of himself as an engineer. He was an RC plane enthusiast, wanting to be a pilot, and repaired broken devices like radios and flashlights given to him by his parents. He studied in the electronics department of Honjo Technical High School, where he was the first to finish the graduation project, the construction of a TV, despite the fact he did not fully understand the circuits. He also had motocross as a hobby.
He enrolled in the Tokyo Designer Gakuin College in 1972 and graduated cum laude in 1975 from the university's interior design course. According to the Tokyo Designers' Gakuin College '75 Design Annual, his graduation project was a dome-shaped stage set hall for Tangerine Dream's performances.

Career
In his fifth year of elementary school, Hirasawa learned to play the electric guitar, inspired by the surf and instrumental rock bands he heard on the radio and on TV, later joining his junior high school's band. In 1973 he formed Mandrake, a progressive rock band that incorporated elements from heavy metal and krautrock together. Being one of the few Japanese progressive rock bands of its time, Mandrake achieved little success and released no albums during its lifetime.
During the early days of Mandrake, he worked as a part-time carrier on a fruits and vegetables market during the morning and at a Pepsi warehouse during the night, alongside Mandrake co-founder Fumiyasu Abe. In 1978, Hirasawa applied for a part-time lecturer position at Yamaha Music Foundation, and got the job, as he was the only person who applied. He taught courses at the Yamaha Synthesizer School until 1983, and met various musicians that he would later collaborate with through these lectures. After leaving his position as teacher, he took to making commercial jingles for the rest of the decade to make ends meet.
After discovering punk rock and working on synthesizer-heavy projects, Hirasawa decided to change the band into the electronic rock band P-Model in 1979. Initially met with success, they changed to the unpopular post-punk and experimental rock genres after Hirasawa went through an adverse reaction to his fame. With Hirasawa at the forefront, the band went through various lineups and achieved some popularity in the Japanese independent music scene.
In 1989, Hirasawa launched his solo career with the release of the album Water in Time and Space. His music incorporated elements from other genres, alongside themes from philosophy and psychology. He continued to change his musical style while concurrently working with two different iterations of P-Model until the group was disbanded in 2000. He has actively been releasing new music since.

Compositions
Hirasawa's music takes from such concepts as analytical psychology, advances in digital technology, the philosophies of yin and yang, and principles of nature versus machines. As an avid fan of science fiction novels since the 1970s and an eclectic reader overall, he's been inspired by the works of Frank Herbert, Carl Jung, Hayao Kawai, Kenji Miyazawa, George Orwell, Wilhelm Reich, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Theodore Sturgeon, Nikola Tesla and Kurt Vonnegut.
A constant source of inspiration for his music has come from Thailand. On a 1994 trip to Phuket, Hirasawa went through a ""Thai shock"", amazed by the country's culture, namely its transgender cabaret performers, some of whom he would invite to be singers on his albums and guest performers in his concerts throughout his career. After many trips back to the country Hirasawa grew to be increasingly identified with the Thai trans community, incorporating their problems and experiences in society into his work.

On having his music categorized based on western trends, Hirasawa has said:""I dislike it when I hear someone describe [my music] as weird rock, or weird techno. Surely this genre is hard to define in the music scene, because it doesn’t meet the standard of Western music charts. Hence if a rock music critic attempts to judge me [and my music], all they come up with is ambient music, or music to take drugs to. [The Japanese music scene] doesn't help with introducing terms such as New Age or transpersonality. I want to let my music reach a broader part of society, being music born from Japanese culture, and I think this is why I want to connect to the world that doesn’t exist in the music scene.""

Performances
For every main solo album he releases, Hirasawa also stages an accompanying ""Interactive Live Show"", an interactive concert that merges computer graphics with his music to tell a story. The flow of each show is determined by audience participation; for example, Interactive Live Show 2000 Philosopher's Propeller was formatted as a maze, and the audience was asked to choose which direction to go in. Provided with phone numbers to four cellular phones during one song, the audience was allowed to call the numbers to have Hirasawa play the corresponding ringtones. This created an improvised harmony between the background music and the ringing phones. Since 1998, participation has been possible through the internet.
Hirasawa's live music is built on samples he activates with various hand-crafted machines and pre-recorded tracks without vocals. For the Solar Live concerts, he used solar power and a power-generating wheel as the source of energy for his electronic equipment.
Hirasawa has worked since the start of his solo career to decrease the amount of performers around himself. Most of his solo albums from 1992 onwards feature no guest musicians, and live backing bands were relinquished in 1994. Since then, only a few select shows have had guest singers or backing instrumentalists.

Equipment usage
Hirasawa is known for his eclectic choice of instrumentation. Some of the instruments he built himself, being inspired by his background in engineering and machinery.

Guitars
Hirasawa has favored guitars designed specifically by Japanese instrument manufacturers. With a movement in the early '80s of electric guitar makers moving away from mass-producing copies of foreign designs and towards original ones, Hirasawa played many unique models. Over a five-year period, from Mandrake's last days to the early P-Model phase, he used the H.S. Anderson Rider, Fernandes Art Wave and ESP Random Star, painting them in bright colors (burgundy, yellow, blue and white). In 1983 he settled on Tōkai Gakki's Talbo aluminum guitars as his main ones, attracted by their unique material and design. He used multiple Tōkai Talbos over an eleven-year period, with the guitar becoming an integral part of his image.
After Tōkai discontinued production and customer support for the Talbo due to financial difficulties in the mid-'90s, Hirasawa requested Fernandes to make him a guitar of his design in 1994 called PHOTON, a Talbo-shaped guitar with a wooden body. In 2004, he requested TALBO Secret FACTORY, a manufacturer of Talbos run by other musicians who also liked the guitar and wanted to continue to use it, to build a Talbo of his own design, called ICE-9 (named after the material of the same name from Kurt Vonnegut's novel Cat's Cradle). It became Hirasawa's main guitar for the next eight years. To showcase it, he made an eponymous mini-album in 2005.
Hirasawa has continued to work with the TALBO Secret FACTORY, requesting the conversion of one of his early Tōkai models into a new design of his, the ASTRO, in 2011 and asking for the renewal of the PHOTON with new specifications after two decades of usage. In 2012, Secret FACTORY co-founder HISASHI gifted him a Talbo of his own design, the EVO 0101Z, which Hirasawa adopted as his new main guitar, owning standard copies as well as two equipped with single coil guitar pickups for selective usage.
Besides those, Hirasawa has also used different types of guitar for specific purposes, playing MIDI guitars like the Ibanez X-ING IMG-2010 and Casio MG500, various acoustic and classical models, classic surf ones like the Mosrite and the Jaguar, and the Aria AS-100C/SPL silent guitar.

Electronics
Hirasawa has used Amiga computers extensively in his work, starting out with CG production in 1987, and later on applying it on his albums and live shows, using applications such as Say, SCALA, Bars & Pipes, SuperJAM! and OctaMED. He stopped using Amigas with the LIMBO-54 shows of 2003 and the Byakkoya/Paprika albums of 2006, since ""maintaining an Amiga now is, like maintaining a classic car, costly"".
In the '90s he started a gradual transition to Microsoft Windows (later on dabbling in Ubuntu for a time), using programs such as Delay Lama, Vocaloids, Bars'n'Pipes (an unofficial continuation of the Amiga program), Cakewalk Sonar and Synth1.
When choosing string tones Hirasawa aims to find ones with unstable pitches and a ""dark sound"", which he finds harmonious, such as the Mellotron, Kurzweil synths and EASTWEST's line of Symphonic sounds.

Recording/production
In the '90s, Hirasawa gradually moved his work from professional facilities to home, dubbing his workspace on various residences ""Studio WIRESELF"". He finally moved completely to it by the recording of 2000's Philosopher's Propeller. The following year he undertook the sustainable energy project ""Hirasawa Energy Works"" and changed his lifestyle so that all his music would be recorded with solar energy. To reduce carbon emission, Studio WIRESELF was outfitted to be powered completely by a photovoltaic system of 2 solar panels, with 2 car batteries to store extra energy. Years later, Hirasawa added 2 more panels to the studio and retired the batteries.
Initially Studio WIRESELF operated on large pieces of equipment, both analog and digital. With the advances of technology and the streamlining of production under Hirasawa Energy Works, the working landscape transitioned to software synthesizers, with the physical elements of the studio reduced to one recording booth and two workstations, one for Hirasawa and the other for engineer Masanori Chinzei.

Activism and charity
In 1988, Hirasawa sold a Cassette Book at a flea market in Yoyogi for charity. It contained three original songs made specifically for the release and came with a thirty-six-page long booklet containing an analysis of his dreams and his current experience. All proceeds were donated to the Human Earth – Awakening Village (人間大地・めざめの里, Ningen Daichi Mezame no Sato) volunteering welfare facility for the mentally ill in Gunma Prefecture, founded by the psychologist who gave Hirasawa counseling around the time he made the P-Model albums Scuba and Karkador.
In 2001, a pregnant stray cat appeared in Hirasawa's studio. He took care of her and helped carry out four of her pregnancies from 2001 to 2002. Since he could not take care of all the kittens, Hirasawa created a temporary site to recruit possible adopters and keep up with the welfare of the various cats.
As Hirasawa objected to the American response after the September 11 attacks, which he believes involved excessive carnage, and the Japanese government's aiding of such actions, he offered downloads of online banners and two of his songs for free, which he hoped would be used as tools of objection. One of them is a rerecording of 1994's ""Love Song"", which is about children in the battlefield; the other is ""High-Minded Castle"", about a man who ""can not know the truth and true background through media, he tries to face the real tragedy on the other side of the world"". The latter was taken from the Blue Limbo album, which displays a dystopian theme partly influenced by the American government's retaliation.
To support freelance journalists, independent and citizen media, Hirasawa started a free music archive to be used by independent news as background music. He sent e-mails to various associates and members of P-Model requesting involvement, the only one to join was guitarist PEVO 1go. The files uploaded were instrumental mixes of songs by both musicians, including some from Vistoron, which revolves around the propagation of a false reality by mass media.
In the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Hirasawa started traveling around the country with a Geiger counter, measuring the radiation levels and reporting them in his Twitter account. In June 2011, a song was posted on his site, titled ""Nuclear Power"" (原子力, Genshiryoku): A rerecording of the P-Model song ""Boat"" (from 1984's Scuba) in the style of ""The Aggregated Past – Kangen Shugi 8760 Hours"" project, with the lyrics changed to protest against Japan's use of nuclear power and to criticize the government and the media. The song, credited to ""Stealthman"", was only available on the site for six days, but could be redistributed if unaltered and not for profit. An instrumental mix was posted on the site by Hirasawa after the original was taken down, following the same distribution guidelines. As these events occurred, Hirasawa told a story on Twitter of being assaulted and having his computer and website hacked by ""Stealthman"". Through his tweets and the way the posts were worded on his website, Hirasawa effectively distanced himself from the track and disowned it. The song is available on the karaoke service provider Xing's JoySound online song library, credited to ""Stealthman"".

Personal life
In 2013, Yūichi opened the café bar Gazio in Tsukuba. Although branded as a ""new wave"" café, the establishment was heavily themed around P-Model and Hirasawa's discography; it contained various band related memorabilia, served original cocktails titled after his songs and often held special events and shows by members and associates of the band. Hirasawa made exclusive content for it and, as he gives his brother most things he has no need for at a given moment, many studio and stage objects were displayed in the café. Gazio ceased operations as an active restaurant in 2015 and rebranded as an art studio; Yūichi now holds twice monthly ""Café Gazio"" events in Kichijōji.
Hirasawa started smoking in 1979 and quit in 2001; he has since become an avid user of electronic cigarettes. He is also a teetotaler, since drinking more than one fifth of beer makes him feel like his head grow ""...five times bigger, then explode."" Despite this, he previously drank wine before singing in order to preserve his voice; he has since replaced this with throat lozenges.
Hirasawa has spoken out in favor of the Big Pharma conspiracy theory. He has been known to promote the usage of alternative medicine, including the widely discredited Miracle Mineral Solution, and has posted on Twitter extensively about his experiences with acupuncture and moxibustion.
Hirasawa is a vegetarian, as he has remarked before, ""At any rate, meat is unappetizing and gross. Eating meat makes me tired and makes me throw up"". He lives in a house in Tsukuba with his pet calico cat named Tebin (テビン). His house also has a garden, where he grows some of his food. He also cultivates bacteria to make soy yogurt.
While repeatedly incorporating various concepts from Shintoism and Buddhism in his themes, as well as ones from other Asian religions, Hirasawa has never specified what his beliefs are. However, at one point in time, he supported the return of the imperial cult of the Emperor of Japan as a psychological measure: ""I think His Majesty needs to recover his glorification. In this matter, I'm sort of right wing; the Emperor of Japan needs to regain his symbolic position as a God. But this is for the sake of a healthy process of collective consciousness, so please don't lump my position in with all the militaristic talk"".

Suzanne Ciani,"Suzanne Ciani (; born June 4, 1946) is an American musician, sound designer, composer, and record label executive who found early success in the 1970s, with her electronic music and sound effects for films and television commercials. Her career has included works with quadraphonic sound. She has been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album five times. Her success with electronic music has her dubbed ""Diva of the Diode"" and ""America's first female synth hero"".

Early life
Ciani was born in an army hospital in Indiana. She was raised in Quincy, Massachusetts, a southern suburb of Boston. She has four sisters and Italian roots. Her father was a physician, and she started to play the piano at age six.
From 1964 to 1968, Ciani studied traditional liberal arts at Wellesley College in nearby Wellesley where she received classical music training. She also took evening classes, one of which was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which is where she first learned about music technology. One artist she cites as a big influence is German photographer Ilse Bing, who provided lyrics and drawings to her track ""Lumière"", along with classical music composers and pianist Glenn Gould.

Ciani studied for a master's degree in composition at University of California, Berkeley, from 1968 to 1970. In her first year, she met synthesizer inventor and pioneer Don Buchla through her boyfriend at the time, and became highly influenced by his analog modular synthesizer, the Buchla, then a competitor of the Moog synthesizer by Bob Moog. Ciani became a devotee, working for Buchla. ""I call Don the Leonardo DaVinci of instrument design."" She spent time with a Buchla synthesizer in a rented studio at the tape music center at Mills College in Oakland, paying $5 for each visit. She took a summer course in computer music at Stanford University where she was taught by  Max Mathews, John Chowning, and Leland Smith at the Artificial Intelligence Lab.
After graduating from Berkeley, Ciani took up work at Buchla and Associates to earn enough money for a Buchla synthesizer of her own, the Buchla 200. There she ""Sat and soldered joints and drilled holes for three dollars an hour. When the synthesizers were finished, tested and shipped off, I felt as though I were losing children"". In a 2019 interview with Michelle Macklem for a feature about her in the KCRW podcast series Lost Notes, Ciani recounted that she and several other employees were keen to learn more about using the synthesizer, so she approached Ed Buchla and asked if he would conduct tutorial sessions for them. Buchla initially agreed, but at the end of the first class he took Ciani aside and declared  ""We've decided that we don't want women in the class,"" to which the horrified Ciani retorted, ""But I'm the only woman in the class!""

Her first paid job in composing was in 1969, producing for 10 Macy's Christmas advertisements. Around this time she worked on sound installations at galleries, exhibitions, and dance performances, composed at San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was housed at Mills College,  composed for films, and recorded experimental pieces in her garage studio. Ciani also started a furniture company but ceased after six months after two ""unsaleable"" designs, theft, fire, and vandalism. She realized that she was not doing what she liked and decided to make her living at music. In 1970, she released her debut record, Voices of Packaged Souls (1970), a collaboration with sculptor Harold Paris, put together using music concrète techniques at radio station KPFA in Berkeley during the night shift. The album had an initial release of 50 copies.

Career
1970s
In April 1974, Ciani began a nineteen-year stay in New York City, travelling only with clothes and her Buchla synthesizer. Among her first activities was a solo performance at the Bonino Gallery in conjunction with the opening of a Ronald Mallory exhibition. Ciani became a session musician, but soon struggled to maintain a steady income. She once accepted a concert performance at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, but when she was denied a four-speaker quadraphonic sound setup, she refused to perform. She also spent three years on the venue's renovation, but ""that didn't work"". At a solo show in April 1975, Ciani learned that Vladimir Ussachevsky had attended and recommended her to a grant. She later wrote that she was ""homeless and happy"" at this time and moved from the loft of art critic Robert Hughes to the floor of Philip Glass's basement recording studio. By 1976, Ciani had secured a National Endowment for the Arts grant.
In 1978 Ciani founded Ciani/Musica. Inc. to produce jingles for advertisements for companies such as Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch, AT&T and General Electric. She enjoyed the opportunity to work for such companies and enjoyed the creative freedom because few people understood what the Buchla could do as it lacked a keyboard. The sound of a bottle of Coca-Cola being opened and poured was one of Ciani's most widely recognized works and was used in radio and television commercials in the late 1970s. She is also responsible for ""logo"" sounds pertaining to Energizer and ABC. Such was the demand for her services, that at one point she was doing up to 10 sessions a week.
Ciani performed as a guest artist on various albums from 1976. The first was the same-titled album by the Starland Vocal Band, including the ""swoosh"" sound to ""Afternoon Delight"". At the time, Ciani thought the work was just a ""song about spaceships"". In the following year, Ciani provided sound effects for Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk, a disco version of the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope soundtrack by Meco. Ciani scored Lloyd Williams's 1975 experimental film Rainbow's Children, and for a 1986 documentary about Mother Teresa. She also composed the 1976 Columbia Pictures and Columbia Pictures Television logo themes.
In 1979, Ciani was commissioned to provide sounds to the pinball machine game Xenon, which featured her own voice fed through a vocoder. This marked the first female voice heard in a pinball game and Ciani had never played pinball before the project arose. In 2013, she was inducted into The Pinball Expo Hall of Fame for her work on the game. Ciani then sampled her voice onto a sound chip with the aim of selling it for use in other applications, including elevator announcements. The US federal government approached her to design sounds for flight simulators.

1980s
In 1980, Ciani demonstrated several of her sound effects on national television with an appearance on The David Letterman Show. The producers agreed for her to perform her own music with the show's house band, but they cut to a commercial break when they started to play. That same year, she also appeared on the PBS children's TV show 3-2-1 Contact demonstrating her synthesizer. Ciani's television work in the 1980s included an Atari commercial and work on a proposed ""negative vocoder"" with Harald Bode, but development ceased following Bode's death in 1987.
Ciani scored the soundtrack to Lily Tomlin's film The Incredible Shrinking Woman, which marked the first solo female composer of a Hollywood film.
In 1982, Ciani released her first studio album characterized by electronic and new-age music. She later said that making albums was something that she had always wanted to do, calling it ""my destiny"". She started on her first, Seven Waves, in 1979 which saw an initial Japanese only release. Ciani reasoned this to the difficulty American record labels had in selling an electronic album by a female artist that lacked vocals. In 1984, it was released in the US by Atlantic Records, thanks to Ilhan Mimaroglu who was an executive at the Finnadar label. The album was produced using an MC-8 and MC-4 sequencer, a Prophet 5 synthesizer,  a Roland TR-808 drum machine, the Buchla 200, Bode Vocoder, Lyricon, Synclavier, Polymoog, and Arp and Eventide Processing.
In 1985, Ciani received a Bronze Lion award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.
Ciani's 1986 album The Velocity of Love, released by RCA Records, features the title track which became her best known song. It marks her first piano recordings for many years since focusing her work on the Buchla.
In July and August 1987, Ciani performed her first live solo concerts in 15 years.

1990s
Although emphasizing electronic music in her recordings, her solo piano album Pianissimo, from 1990, became her best-selling album. Ciani ended her contract with Private Music with the compilation The Private Music of Suzanne Ciani, in 1992.
In 1991, Ciani released Hotel Luna, the music for which was inspired by her travels to Italy to learn more about her Italian ancestry.
In 1992, the soap opera One Life to Live introduced a new theme song written and performed by Ciani, who also did scoring for several episodes of the show.
In 1994, Ciani founded her own independent record label, Seventh Wave. Her husband became the label's president. All of her subsequent albums have been released on the label.
Her 1994 album Dream Suite was recorded in Moscow with the Young Russia Orchestra, and was Grammy-nominated. 1999's Turning featured her first composition with lyrics, in the title track, sung by Taiwanese artist Chyi Yu.

2000s–present
In early 2006, Ciani's Silver Ship won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best New Age Album. Ciani was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.
Ciani performed in a new-age jazz group, The Wave.
In February 2015, Ciani was one of three Wellesley College alumnae to receive an Alumnae Achievement Award.
In 2016, Ciani released Buchla Concerts 1975, formed of two live performances in New York City in April 1975. She was asked to release some archived material and following its release and ""All of a sudden I was in the public eye with the electronics again! I wasn't aware at all about what was going on; it felt strange. [...] There was this whole renaissance going on when I came out"". Buchla then convinced Ciani to purchase a Buchla synthesizer from him following his decision to sell his company, but she left it for a year before she started to use it.
In 2016, Ciani released Sunergy, a collaboration using Buchla synthesizers with the musician Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, as part of the RVNG Intl. FRKWYS Series.

In May 2017, Ciani became the first female to receive a Moog Music Innovation Award at the annual electronic festival Moogfest.
In June 2018, Ciani released LIVE Quadraphonic, a live album documenting her first solo performance on a Buchla synthesizer in 40 years. The show took place at Gray Area in San Francisco on March 5, 2016, presented in four channel quadraphonic sound. A recording of this performance was one of the first quadraphonic LP vinyl releases in over 30 years and used an encoding process based on the QS Regular Matrix system. Inspired by the Buchla 227 quad output module, the $227 release was a very limited edition of only 227 numbered, 45 rpm, 180g quadraphonic vinyl discs sold. The box also included an enamel pin based on the album cover, plus a custom quadraphonic hardware decoder made in collaboration with Involve Audio to decode two channels of audio from the vinyl disc back to the four-channel recording.
In June 2019, Finders Keepers Records released a previously unreleased album by Ciani that she recorded in 1969 entitled Flowers of Evil. It features a recital of Élévation by French poet Charles Baudelaire with Ciani performing on a Buchla synthesizer.

Personal life
In 1992, Ciani was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from which she recovered after radiation treatments and surgery. The news prompted her relocation from New York City to California and she has resided in the coastal community of Bolinas since.
From 1994 to 2000, Ciani was married to producer and entertainment attorney Joseph Anderson. The marriage ended in divorce.

System 7 (band),"System 7 are a UK-based electronic dance music band. Due to the existence of another band called System Seven they were initially billed as 777 in North America. System 7 was also the name of the current version of the Macintosh operating system at the time, although this was not the reason for the temporary name change.
Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy, both formerly of Gong, formed System 7 in 1989, after a period of several years becoming gradually immersed in the developments of electronic and dance music in the UK while Steve was working mainly as a record producer for other artists. A key early collaborator was DJ Alex Paterson (of the Orb), whom Steve and Miquette heard playing Hillage's 1979 ambient record Rainbow Dome Musick in an ambient DJ set at the London club Heaven. They soon became part of the underground dance scene in London. While Hillage and Giraudy form the core of System 7, it is an extended collaborative project with artists such as A Guy Called Gerald, Paul Oakenfold, Carl Craig, Laurent Garnier, Derrick May, Alex Paterson, and Youth. System 7 makes extensive use of Hillage's electric guitars.
Hillage and Giraudy later launched a chill-out and downtempo sister project called Mirror System, and have also worked under the name Groovy Intent.
The first System 7 album was released on Virgin's 10 Records dance music label, followed by the vinyl-only Derrick May collaboration Altitude (featuring Ultra Naté). In 1992, System 7 moved to Youth's Butterfly label, releasing four albums, until 1999 when they founded their own label A-Wave for all future releases, also re-releasing their Butterfly catalogue.
In addition to the albums, System 7 have released a number of club singles with notable remixes from, among others, Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Dubfire, James Holden, Liquid Soul, and Son Kite.

System 7 Live
Early 1990s
System 7 were one of the first techno groups to play live, and have developed a live performance approach that is a bit more extreme than their records, with tougher beats and hypnotic live echo loops. The first System 7 live show was in December 1990 at Linford Studios in Battersea, London, consisting of Steve playing guitar and Alex Paterson playing samples and DJing pre-release versions of the upcoming first System 7 and Orb albums. In 1991 there were some more shows and a tour to support the System 7 album release, with Miquette's synthesisers incorporated into the live sound. In 1993 System 7, now playing as a duo, developed a new live technical format and joined Orbital, The Drum Club, and Aphex Twin on the Midi Circus tour of the UK with Megadog party crew.

Festivals
Partly through their extended involvement with Megadog, by 1994 System 7 had become an established live act, in particular playing at many music festivals. In 1995, through his previous association with Michael Eavis, Steve Hillage was asked to oversee the putting together of the first official dance music stage at Glastonbury Festival. In subsequent years System 7 played at Glastonbury a further 15 times, often at the open-air Glade stage, a further dance music development at the festival that started in 2000. The crew from the Glastonbury Glade stage created their own spin-off festival, the Glade Festival, starting in 2004, with System 7 playing there 5 times.
Other major festivals where they have played include Phoenix Festival, Beach Festival, Wickerman, Willowman, Womad, Sunrise Celebration, Waveform, Whirl-Y-Gig, Guilfest, and Eden Festival (UK); Printemps de Bourges, Borealis and Francofolies (France); Lovefield and Burg Herzberg (Germany); Pink Pop and Lowlands (Netherlands); Dour Festival and I Love Techno (Belgium); Sonica (Italy); Open Air Field (Czech Republic); Odinstown and Roskilde (Denmark); Hultsfred and Arvika (Sweden); Konemetsä (Finland); Indigo Festival (Israel); Ozora (Hungary); Reverence Valada and Boom Festival (Portugal).
Outside of Europe they have played at Juggernaut Festival and the Big Top tour (USA); Fuji Rock, Summersonic, Star Festival, Amami Eclipse 2009, Hotaka, Asagiri Jam, Nagisa Festival, Solstice Music Festival and the World Festival of Sacred Music (Japan); Earthcore (Australia); Universo Paralello (Brazil); Tribal Gathering (Panama).

Recent shows
System 7 co-headlined at Matsuri Digital's Timeless event at AgeHa, Tokyo on 14 March 2015, and at the Megadog 30th anniversary event at Manchester Academy on 21 November 2015. They continue to play their own club shows and at parties and festivals, including Glastonbury, Ozora and Boom. They have also been involved in some notable live collaborations with The Orb, Japanese progressive space rock jam band Rovo (Phoenix Rising), Japanese rock guitarist and Juno Reactor collaborator Sugizo, leading psy-trance artist Ajja (Novelty Engine), and Merv Pepler of Eat Static (System Static).

Mirror System Live
System 7's chill-out and downtempo sister project Mirror System made its live debut on the ID Spiral chill-out stage at the UK Sunrise Celebration festival in 2006, followed closely by a set also with ID Spiral at the Glade Festival of that year. In 2007, ID Spiral opened the InSpiral Lounge in Camden. London, and Mirror System played at the opening party on 16 December 2007. They became one of the resident artists at the InSpiral Lounge playing there two or three times a year, including most of the inSpiral New Year's Eve parties. Mirror System live also became popular in Japan, and at European trance festivals where they have been booked as the chill-out stage closing act at Sonica (twice), Ozora (three times) and Boom Festival, where in 2016 they followed their closing set with a full-length live rendition of Rainbow Dome Musick. With the Reflector DJ mix album (release in 2009) the Mirror System sound expanded to incorporate a soft techno dance groove element, and this element has been further developed in their most recent album, N-Port. This ability to seamlessly move from deep chill to danceable grooves that still retain the chill element, has been an important factor in the Mirror System live approach.

System 7 in Japan
Since their first show, at the closing party for Tokyo's On Air club on 4 May 1994 with Orbital and Alex Paterson, System 7 have toured in Japan on twenty-eight further occasions. In addition Steve Hillage went to Japan to play with Manuel Göttsching at Metamorphose Festival (2010) and to play with Tomita at Free Dommune Festival in 2013, plus an additional visit to mix the Phoenix Rising album in February 2013. System 7 have a special relationship with Japan, and have been closely associated with the development of live dance music there. As an extension to this special spiritual connection, System 7 played as the only electronic dance music act at the World Festival of Sacred Music at Itsukujima shrine on Miyajima in 2001, and also offered a hōnō (dedicatory) performance at Tenkawa-Daibenzaiten-sha (Tenkawa shrine) in Nara in 2013. In 2006 they were approached by Rumiko Tezuka, the daughter of famed manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka, to see if they were interested in making musical interpretations of her father's Phoenix manga graphic novels. Rumiko had first become interested in System 7 after seeing them perform at the Miyajima festival. This project excited System 7 and it led directly to their album Phoenix (released in Japan in 2007), which became their biggest selling album in Japan and also produced their successful Japanese single Hinotori (which means bird of fire). The phoenix theme, with Rumiko Tezuka's endorsement, continued with System 7's album and tour collaboration with Japanese band Rovo, which was titled Phoenix Rising, and also featured Rovo's live rock re-interpretation of the track Hinotori. Other System 7 recording and remixing collaborations in Japan have been with Mito (of the group Clammbon), Sugizo, and Joujouka, the group founded by noted Japanese psychedelic trance DJ Tsuyoshi Suzuki.

Tangerine Dream,"Tangerine Dream is a German electronic music band founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese the only constant member until his death in January 2015. The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-1970s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In 1979, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann until his own departure in 1985. This lineup was notable for composing many movie soundtracks. Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning. Quaeschning is Froese's chosen successor and is currently the longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005. Quaeschning is currently joined by violinist Hoshiko Yamane who joined in 2011  and Paul Frick who joined in 2020. Prior to this Quaeschning and Yamane performed with Ulrich Schnauss from 2014 to 2020. Schnauss only played two shows with Froese in November 2014 before Froese's passing.
Tangerine Dream are considered a pioneering act in electronica. Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische Musik (""cosmic music""). Their ""Virgin Years"", so called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, including the UK top 20 albums Phaedra (1974) and Rubycon (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores.
From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica. Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age and electronic dance music.
On 29 September 2017, the band released an all-new music studio album entitled Quantum Gate. In December 2019, they released Recurring Dreams, a compilation of new recordings of some of the band's classic compositions. On 26 November 2021, the band released an EP entitled Probe 6–8 (including three tracks: ""Raum"", ""Para Guy"" and ""Continuum""), whose concept was developed further on their following album Raum, their latest studio album to date which was released on 25 February 2022.

Lineup
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Tangerine Dream existed as several short-lived incarnations, all of which included Froese, who teamed up with several musicians from West Berlin's underground music scene, including Steve Jolliffe, Sven-Åke Johansson, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler.
Froese's most notable association was his partnership with Christopher Franke. Franke joined Tangerine Dream in 1970 after serving time in the group Agitation Free, originally to replace Schulze as the drummer. Franke is credited with starting to use electronic sequencers, which were introduced on Phaedra, a development that had not only a large impact on the group's music but on many electronic musicians to this day. Franke stayed with the group for 17 years, leaving in 1988 because of exhausting touring schedules, as well as creative differences with Froese.
Other long-term members of the group include Peter Baumann (1971–1977), who later went on to found the new-age label Private Music, to which the band was signed from 1988 to 1991; Johannes Schmoelling (1979–1985); Paul Haslinger (1986–1990); Froese's son Jerome Froese (1990–2006); Linda Spa (1990–1996, 2005–2014), a saxophonist & flute player who appeared on numerous albums and concerts, contributing one track on Goblins' Club; and most recently Thorsten Quaeschning of Picture Palace Music (2005–present).
A number of other members were also part of Tangerine Dream for shorter periods of time. Unlike session musicians, these players also contributed to compositions of the band during their tenures. Some of the more notable members are Steve Schroyder (organist, 1971–1972), Michael Hoenig (who replaced Baumann for a 1975 Australian tour and a London concert, included on Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1), Steve Jolliffe (wind instruments, keyboards and vocals on Cyclone and the following tour; he was also part of a short-lived 1969 line-up), Klaus Krüger (drummer on Cyclone and Force Majeure) and Ralf Wadephul (in collaboration with Edgar Froese recorded album Blue Dawn, but it was released only in 2006; also credited for one track on Optical Race (1988) and toured with the band in support of this album).
Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream was often joined on stage by Zlatko Perica or Gerald Gradwohl on guitars, and Emil Hachfeld on electronic drums. Jerome Froese left in 2006 after a concert at the Tempodrom in Berlin. Until late 2014, Tangerine Dream comprised Edgar Froese, as well as Thorsten Quaeschning, who first collaborated in the composition of Jeanne d'Arc (2005). For concerts and recordings, they were usually joined by Linda Spa on saxophone and flute, Iris Camaa on drums and percussion, and Bernhard Beibl on guitar. In 2011, electric violinist Hoshiko Yamane was added to the lineup and is featured on some of the most recent albums.
In late 2014, Bernhard Beibl announced on his Facebook page that he would stop collaborating with Tangerine Dream. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Tangerine Dream would no longer be touring with Linda Spa or Iris Camaa, but that Ulrich Schnauss had been brought into the fold. Edgar Froese's death in January 2015, however, left this a short-lived line-up.

History
Origins: psychedelia and krautrock
Edgar Froese arrived in West Berlin in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the psychedelic rock-styled The Ones, disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of multimedia, and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment: ""In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible."" As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the Surrealists, and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by mishearing the line ""tangerine trees and marmalade skies"" from the Beatles' track ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".
Froese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.
Released in 1970 by record label Ohr, the first Tangerine Dream album, Electronic Meditation, was a tape-collage Krautrock piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. Electronic Meditation began the period known as the Pink Years (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). Subsequent albums, beginning with Alpha Centauri, relied heavily on electronic instruments. The band's music during the early 1970s prominently featured organ from Steve Schroyder (on Alpha Centauri) or Peter Baumann (on subsequent releases), commonly augmented by guitar from Froese and drums from Christopher Franke. They also started their heavy usage of the Mellotron during this period.

Rise to fame: the Virgin years
The band's 1973 album Atem was named as one of British DJ John Peel's records of the year, and this attention helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling Virgin Records in the same year. Soon afterward they released the album Phaedra, an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached No. 15 in the UK Albums Chart and became one of Virgin's first bona fide hits. Phaedra was one of the first commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define much more than just the band's own sound. The creation of the album's title track was something of an accident: the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired Moog synthesizer, and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added flute, bass guitar, and Mellotron performances. The Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was so sensitive to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the 'Virgin Years'.
Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age (although the band themselves disliked the term) and electronic dance music.
In the 1980s, along with other electronic music pioneers such as Jean-Michel Jarre (with whom Edgar Froese collaborated on Jarre's 2015 album Electronica 1: The Time Machine) and Vangelis, the band were early adopters of the new digital technology, which revolutionized the sound of the synthesizer, although the group had been using digital equipment (in some shape or form) as early as the mid-1970s. Their technical competence and extensive experience in their early years with self-made instruments and unusual means of creating sounds meant that they were able to exploit this new technology to make music quite unlike anything heard before.

Tangerine Dream live
Tangerine Dream's earliest concerts were visually simple by modern standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with patch cords and a few flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness, as happened during the performance at York Minster on 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.
Through the 1970s and 1980s, the band toured extensively. The concerts generally included large amounts of unreleased and improvised material and were consequently widely bootlegged. They were notorious for playing extremely loudly  and for a long time. The band released recordings of a fair number of their concerts, and on some of these the band worked out material that would later form the backbone of their studio recordings.

Forays into vocals
Most of Tangerine Dream's albums are entirely instrumental.  Two earlier albums that prominently featured lyrics were Cyclone (1978) and Tyger (1987). While there were occasionally a few vocals on the band's other releases, such as the track ""Kiew Mission"" from 1981's Exit and ""The Harbor"" from 1987's Shy People, the group only returned to featuring vocals on a larger scale in a musical trilogy based on Dante's Divine Comedy. This was followed by a 2007 album Madcap's Flaming Duty and a 2010 cover collection Under Cover – Chapter One.
After their 1980 East Berlin gig, when they became one of the first major Western bands to perform in a communist country, Tangerine Dream released a double live album of one of their performances there, called Poland, recorded during their tour in the winter at the end of 1983. With Poland, the band moved to the Jive Electro label, marking the beginning of the Blue Years.

Soundtracks
Throughout the 1980s, Tangerine Dream composed scores for more than 20 films. This had been an interest of Froese's since the late 1960s, when he scored and acted in the experimental film ""Auf Scheißer schießt man nicht"", directed by Hansjürgen Pohland. Many of the group's soundtracks were composed at least partially of reworked material from the band's studio albums or work that was in progress for upcoming albums; see, for example, the resemblance between the track ""Igneous"" on their soundtrack for Thief and the track ""Thru Metamorphic Rocks"" on their studio release Force Majeure. Their first exposure on US television came when a track for the then in-progress album Le Parc was used as the theme for the television program Street Hawk. Some of the more famous soundtracks have been Sorcerer, Thief, Legend, Risky Business, The Keep, Firestarter, Flashpoint, Heartbreakers, Shy People and Near Dark.
Tangerine Dream also composed 35 hours of music stems for the video game Grand Theft Auto V.
In 2016, Tangerine Dream released their own version of the theme music for the television series Stranger Things.  Tangerine Dream had inspired music for the series.

Going independent
Several of the band's albums released during the 1990s were nominated for Grammy Awards. Since then, Tangerine Dream with Jerome Froese took a directional change away from the new-age leanings of those albums and toward an electronica style. After Jerome's departure, founder Edgar Froese steered the band in a direction somewhat reminiscent of material throughout their career.
In later years, Tangerine Dream released albums in series. The Dream Mixes series began in 1995 with the last being released in 2010. The Divine Comedy series, based on the writings of Dante Alighieri, spanned 2002–2006. From 2007 to 2010, the Five Atomic Seasons were released. Most recently, the Eastgate Sonic Poems series, based on the works of famous poetic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, began in 2011, with the last appearing in 2013. Also, beginning in 2007, Tangerine Dream released a number of EPs, referred to as ""CupDiscs"" by the band.
Edgar Froese also released a number of solo recordings, which are similar in style to Tangerine Dream's work. Jerome Froese released a number of singles as TDJ Rome, which are similar to his work within the Dream Mixes series. In 2005, he released his first solo album Neptunes under the name Jerome Froese.  In 2006, Jerome left Tangerine Dream to concentrate on his solo career. His second solo album Shiver Me Timbers was released on 29 October 2007, and his third, Far Side of the Face, was released in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Jerome Froese joined with former Tangerine Dream member Johannes Schmoelling and keyboardist Robert Waters to form the band Loom, which plays original material, as well as Tangerine Dream classics. Thorsten Quaeschning, leader of Picture Palace Music, was brought into Tangerine Dream in 2005 and contributed to most of the band's albums and CupDiscs since then.
The group had recording contracts with Ohr, Virgin, Jive Electro, Private Music, and Miramar, and many of the minor soundtracks were released on Varèse Sarabande. In 1996, the band founded their own record label, TDI, and more recently, Eastgate. Subsequent albums are today generally not available in normal retail channels but are sold by mail-order or through online channels. The same applies to their Miramar releases, the rights to which the band bought back. Meanwhile, their Ohr and Jive Electro catalogs (known as the ""Pink"" and ""Blue"" Years) are currently owned by Esoteric Recordings.

Concert updates
To celebrate their 40th anniversary (1967–2007), Tangerine Dream announced their only UK concert: at London Astoria on 20 April 2007. The band also played a totally free open-air concert in Eberswalde on 1 July 2007 and at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt on Main on 7 October 2007. 2008 saw the band in Eindhoven Netherlands playing at E-Day (an electronic music festival); later in the year they also played the Night of the Prog Festival in Loreley, Germany, as well as concerts at the Kentish Town Forum, in London on 1 November, at the Picture House, Edinburgh on 2 November, and their first live concert in the US for over a decade, at the UCLA Royce Hall, Los Angeles on 7 November.
In 2009, the group announced that they would play a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, on 1 April 2010, titled the Zeitgeist concert, 35 years after their milestone concert there on 2 April 1975. The entire concert was released as a 3-CD live album on 7 July 2010.
Tangerine Dream embarked in spring and summer 2012 on a tour of Europe, Canada and the USA called The Electric Mandarine Tour 2012: The 1st leg was a 5-date European tour, beginning on 10 April in Budapest (Hungary) via Padua (Italy), Milano (Italy), Zurich (Switzerland), and ending on 10 May in Berlin (Germany). The 2nd leg was a North-American tour that started with the Jazz Festival in Montréal (Canada) on 30 June, followed by a concert on 4 July at the Bluesfest in Ottawa (Canada) and continued as a 10-date US journey beginning in July in Boston, then New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and California. On 16 November 2014, Tangerine Dream performed in Melbourne, Australia, as part of Melbourne Music Week. They were the final shows with Froese.  Tangerine Dream played two consecutive nights at the Union Chapel, Islington London on April 23 & 24 2018, the second supported by ex-Japan and Porcupine Tree musician Richard Barbieri. In October and November 2019, Tangerine Dream went on its 16 step Random & Revision Tour.
2023 sees the band embark on the largest tour of their entire career, including a 19-date tour of North America (September 8 – October 5: taking in Miami, Asheville, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Vancouver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, New York, Montreal, Toronto and Chicago), 13-dates in Germany (October 10 – 28), and 10-dates in the UK (November 5 – 14)

After Edgar Froese's death
Edgar Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. On 6 April 2015, the group's remaining members (Quaeschning, Schnauss and Yamane) and Bianca Acquaye (Froese's widow), pledged to continue working together in an effort to fulfill Froese's vision for the group. However, ex-member Jerome Froese announced in his Facebook time line that in his opinion Tangerine Dream will not exist without his father.
Tangerine Dream played their first show following Froese's death on 9 June 2016 in Szczecin, Poland.
On 29 September 2017, Tangerine Dream released their new studio album entitled Quantum Gate, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the band's foundation. The album is based on ideas and musical sketches by founder Edgar Froese and was completed by the remaining members of the band.
On 31 January 2020, Tangerine Dream re-released their December 2019 album Recurring Dreams, an 11-track collection of new recordings of some of the band's classic tracks, worldwide through Kscope. This was launched to coincide with the Tangerine Dream: Zeitraffer exhibition which opened on 17 January 2020 at London's Barbican and runs until 2 May 2020.
On 9 June 2020, Paul Frick became the first member to join the group following Edgar's death after having made guest appearances with the band starting in November 2018. Later on, the group started working on a new studio album entitled Raum, featuring Froese's archival recordings in early 2022 via Kscope. Frick has the unique distinction of being the first addition to the group who did not ever personally meet Froese.
It was announced on 22 June 2021 that Ulrich Schnauss has decided to stop performing live. Since then the band's official website lists him as a former member.
In March 2023, the band embarked on the longest tour of their entire career, with concerts in Portugal (Casa da Música), Switzerland (Geneva's Electron Festival), The Netherlands (3-date tour), Belgium (Het Depot), France (La Gaîté Lyrique), Poland (2-date tour), Romania (TIFF Festival), the US (16-date tour), Canada (3-date tour), Germany (12-date tour), England (8-date tour), Scotland (2-date tour) and Poland (1-date).

Artistic connections
Influences
Tangerine Dream began as a surreal krautrock band, with each of the members contributing different musical influences and styles, before becoming a ""revered progressive electronic act."" Edgar Froese's guitar style was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, as well as the avant-garde composers Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen, while Christopher Franke contributed elements of György Ligeti and Terry Riley. Yes-like progressive rock influence was brought in by Steve Jolliffe on Cyclone. The sample-based sound collages of Johannes Schmoelling drew their inspiration from a number of sources; one instance is Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians on parts of Logos Live, and the track ""Love on a Real Train"" from the Risky Business soundtrack.
Classical music has had an influence on the sound of Tangerine Dream over the years. György Ligeti, Johann Sebastian Bach, Pierre Boulez, Iannis Xenakis, Maurice Ravel, and Arcangelo Corelli are clearly visible as dominant influences in the early albums. A Baroque sensibility sometimes informs the more coordinated sequencer patterns, which has its most direct expression in the La Folia section that comes at the very end of the title track of Force Majeure. In live performances, the piano solos often directly quoted from Romantic classical works for piano, such as the Beethoven and Mozart snippets in much of the late 1970s – early 1980s stage shows. In the bootleg recording of the Mannheim Mozartsaal concert of 1976 (Tangerine Tree volume 13), the first part of the first piece also clearly quotes from Franz Liszt's Totentanz. The first phrase is played on a harpsichord synthesizer patch and is answered by the second half of the phrase in a flute voicing on a Mellotron. During the 1990s, many releases included recordings of classical compositions: Pictures at an Exhibition (on Turn of the Tides), Largo (from Xerxes) (on Tyranny of Beauty), Symphony in A Minor (by J. S. Bach), and Concerto in A Major / Adagio (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (both on Ambient Monkeys).
Since the 1990s, Tangerine Dream have also recorded cover versions of Jimi Hendrix' ""Purple Haze"" (first on 220 Volt Live) and The Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Back in the U.S.S.R."", ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", and ""Norwegian Wood"".
An infrequently recurring non-musical influence on Tangerine Dream, and Edgar Froese in particular, have been 12th–19th-century poets. This was first evident on the 1981 album Exit, the track title ""Pilots of the Purple Twilight"" being a quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem Locksley Hall. Six years later, the album Tyger featured poems from William Blake set to music; and around the turn of the millennium, Edgar Froese started working on a musical trilogy based on Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, completed in 2006. Most recently, the 2007 album Madcap's Flaming Duty features more poems set to music, some again from Blake but also e.g. Walt Whitman.
Pink Floyd were also an influence on Edgar Froese and Tangerine Dream, the band in its very early psychedelic rock band phase playing improvisations based on Pink Floyd's ""Interstellar Overdrive"". Madcap's Flaming Duty is dedicated to the memory of the late Syd Barrett. The title refers to Barrett's solo release The Madcap Laughs.
The band's influence can be felt in ambient artists such as Deepspace, The Future Sound of London, David Kristian, and Global Communication, as well as rock, pop, and dance artists such as Porcupine Tree, M83, DJ Shadow, Ulrich Schnauss, Cut Copy, and Kasabian. The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s trance music, notably Chicane; both  ""Offshore"" and ""Sunstroke"" borrow heavily from ""Love on a Real Train""  where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases Rubycon and Ricochet, as well as some of their music from the early 1980s. The group have also been sampled countless times, more recently by Recoil on the album SubHuman, by Sasha on Involver, and on several Houzan Suzuki albums. Michael Jackson also cited Tangerine Dream as one of his favourite bands, especially their 1977 soundtrack for the film Sorcerer.

In popular culture
In the critically acclaimed 1991 Mexican telenovela Cadenas de Amargura, Tangerine Dream's song ""Yucatan"" is used as part of the novela's music score particularly in the more suspenseful scenes.
Steven Wilson, of Porcupine Tree, stated that Tangerine Dream was one of his influences to make his music, and often cites Zeit as his all-time favorite album.
Japanese electronic musician Susumu Hirasawa dedicated his song ""Island Door (Paranesian Circle)"" (トビラ島（パラネシアン・サークル）, Tobira Shima (Paraneshian Circle)) to Tangerine Dream.
In 2016, Netflix's original show Stranger Things used three Tangerine Dream tracks in its soundtrack: ""Green Desert"" from Green Desert (1986) in episode five, ""Exit"" from Exit (1981) in episode six, of season 1 and ""Tangent (Rare Bird)"" from Poland (1984) in episode nine of season 2. Composers of the soundtrack for the show, Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of the electronic band Survive, also cited Tangerine Dream as the key influence behind the soundtrack, the main theme of which was later covered by Tangerine Dream.
In 2022, the horned dinosaur Bisticeratops froeseorum was named in memory of Edgar Froese, the late founder of Tangerine Dream.

Taylor Deupree,"Taylor Deupree (born April 30, 1971), is an American electronic musician, photographer, graphic designer and mastering engineer. He is most known for the founding of the 12k record label, along with his work as a member of Prototype 909, and his collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Marcus Fischer, Stephan Mathieu, Savvas Ysatis, Christopher Willits and others. In 2008, Taylor Deupree was the Président d'Honneur of the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards 5th in Paris (France).

Mastering engineer (2008–present)
Starting with simple mastering duties when he worked as the Art Director for Instinct Records in the late 1990s, Deupree's work as a mastering engineer became a steady job around 2008 when he relocated out of the city. He works in a purpose-built studio every day mastering music for clients of all genres, but often specializing in electronic, experimental, modern classical and other forms of alternative music.

Human Mesh Dance / Prototype 909 / SETI (the Instinct Records years) (1993–1997)
One of Deupree's early solo projects, Human Mesh Dance, which was begun in 1993 and ended in 1997 while he worked as the Art Director for Instinct Records was an ambient project that was a strong contrast to Prototype 909's more mainstream techno sound. He released three albums as Human Mesh Dance, along with appearances on numerous ambient compilations. Also in 1993, Deupree teamed up with Savvas Ysatis, a Greek electronic artist, to create several different projects, each with different sounds. SETI produced ambient electronica, with sounds and words from the various SETI projects from around the world. Futique was the duo's trip hop project, and its Detroit techno output was released under the Arc moniker. In 1996, the duo formed the short-lived label Index, which released only a single 12"" EP, containing four tracks by various artists.

12k (1997–present)
Deupree founded 12k on January 1, 1997, based on the name of the first Arc album, 12k. On the name 12k:

It first came about when Savvas and I named our first Arc CD (on kk records) 12k. We did so because all of the sequencer files for the tracks on the album ended up having file sizes of 12k. It was an intriguing and mysterious title..so we took it for the album. A year later, when i was thinking of label names, I couldn't get 12k out of my head. I was looking for a name that was abstract and technical-sounding, yet at the same time mysterious and would make people wonder what it was about. It was also very important that it had to be easy to say, look good on paper, and be able to be understood and pronounced by virtually anyone in the world, no matter which language they speak. 12k fit all of those requirements.
12k publishes what Deupree refers to as minimalist electronic and acoustic ambient music, which often features a fragile blend of synthetic sounds, tape machines and a range of acoustic instrumentation.
Early productions by 12k were limited to between 500 and 1,000 units, partially because of limited storage space, and also because the small edition size increased the collectability of the albums. Since around 2001, editions became less limited but still started at between 1,000 and 2,000 copies.

Recent
Deupree has stated that he will be focusing on releasing solo music under his own name for the foreseeable future. He has done collaborations with several different experimental artists.
In 2022, Deupree acted as mastering engineer for Alanis Morissette's ambient album The Storm Before the Calm.

Telefon Tel Aviv,"Telefon Tel Aviv is an American electronic music act formed in 1999 by musicians Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis. Since Cooper's accidental death in 2009, Telefon Tel Aviv has continued with Eustis as the sole official member.

History
Telefon Tel Aviv was formed in 1999 by Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis, with their first album Fahrenheit Fair Enough, released in the fall of 2001 to positive reviews. In 2002, the group released an EP on the Hefty Records Immediate Action label. In 2004, the duo released their second full-length album, Map of What Is Effortless, and a compilation album of remixes titled Remixes Compiled in 2007. The group released its third full-length album in January 2009 on the BPitch Control label. Influenced by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Immolate Yourself peaked at #17 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart. In 2016, their debut was re-released with eight bonus tracks.
Since 2011, Eustis has been working on new music. In March 2012, Eustis mentioned on his Twitter account that he was ""trying"" to work on new Telefon Tel Aviv material. In February 2013, Eustis was announced as a member of the touring lineup of Nine Inch Nails. He was originally slated to tour with band throughout 2013 and 2014. However, on December 5, 2013, it was revealed by Trent Reznor that Eustis was no longer part of the Nine Inch Nails touring line-up, citing only Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin, Robin Finck, and himself as band members during an IAmA on Reddit. Eustis also confirmed this on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website.

Death of Charles Cooper
On January 22, 2009, Eustis announced on the group's MySpace blog that Charles Cooper had died. The information also appeared on the band's website: ""Charles Wesley Cooper III / April 12, 1977 - January 22, 2009"".  Two CBS2 Chicago articles about Cooper's death specify that he went missing on January 21 before being found dead.
On January 30, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace blog that all tour plans have been cancelled and the future of the band is uncertain.
On March 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace blog that he will perform on stage with a close friend of the group, Fredo Nogueira.
On July 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace in order to clarify some rumours about Cooper's death, stating that three autopsy reports ruled it was not a suicide but possibly an accidental mix of sleeping pills and alcohol.

Sons Of Magdalene and Future
On December 9, 2013, Josh Eustis posted on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website that he was going back into the studio full-time, as he was no longer a touring member of Nine Inch Nails and presumably Puscifer as well. In the same post, Eustis stated that he has been sitting on a 95% finished full-length album under the moniker of Sons Of Magdalene, a name previously used for an EP released in 2008. Additionally, the post confirmed that after the record was finished, he would be working on Telefon Tel Aviv full-time. The debut album from the Sons of Magdelene moniker, Move to Pain, was released June 24 2014.

Production
In interviews, Cooper and Eustis have stated that they use the following software: Digidesign Pro Tools, Native Instruments Reaktor/Electronic Instruments 2 XT, Ableton Live and Max/MSP
Additionally, the band has contributed samples to the Native Instruments Synthetic Drums 2 sample library.
For the album Immolate Yourself the band drastically changed their production style, reverting to analog tape and analog synthesizers, claiming this method to ""sound more real"".

Terre Thaemlitz,"Terre Thaemlitz is a musician, composer, owner of the record label Comatonse Recordings, and a public speaker. Thaemlitz's work critically combines themes of identity politics – including gender, sexuality, class, linguistics, ethnicity and race – with an ongoing critique of the socio-economics of commercial media production. This diversity of themes is matched by Thaemlitz's wide range of production styles, which include electroacoustic computer music, club-oriented deep house, digital jazz, ambient, and computer-composed neo-expressionist piano solos. Graphic design, photography, illustration, text and video also play a part in Thaemlitz's projects.

Activism
As a speaker and educator on issues of non-essentialist transgender, pansexual and queer sexuality, Thaemlitz has participated in panel discussions throughout Europe and Japan, as well as held numerous cross-cultural sensitivity workshops at Tokyo's Uplink Factory near Thaemlitz's current residence in Kawasaki, Japan.
Terre Thaemlitz's Soil and Tranquilizer releases in the early and mid-1990s served to introduce a ""political"" form of ambient music, continued in later releases such as Couture Cosmetique and Means from an End, which aim to recast the usually passive artist-listener-environment equation. Thaemlitz's colleagues in the political ambient music front include the sound activist group Ultra-red. Following their remixes of Thaemlitz's Still Life with Numerical Analysis in 1998, Ultra-red joined Thaemlitz on the German label Mille Plateaux for their first two albums: Second Nature: An Electroacoustic Pastoral (1999) and Structural Adjustments (2000).
Terre Thaemlitz published the essay collection Nuisance in 2015, which contained essays on identity and music written between 1996 and its year of publication. In the introduction, which was originally written in 2006, Thaemlitz writes, ""My intention is to write in defense of pessimism, and to critically reject the incessant optimism lurking at the core of virtually all media, conferences, concerts, events and symposia – ""critical media"" or not.""

Terry Riley,"Terrence Mitchell ""Terry"" Riley (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer and performing musician best known as a pioneer of the minimalist school of composition. Influenced by jazz and Indian classical music, his work became notable for its innovative use of repetition, tape music techniques, improvisation, and delay systems. His best known works are the 1964 composition In C and the 1969 album A Rainbow in Curved Air, both considered landmarks of minimalism and important influences on experimental music, rock, and contemporary electronic music. Subsequent works such as Shri Camel (1980) explored just intonation.
Raised in Redding, California, Riley began studying composition and performing solo piano in the 1950s. He befriended and collaborated with composer La Monte Young, and later became involved with both the San Francisco Tape Music Center and Young's New York collective, the Theatre of Eternal Music. A three-record deal with CBS in the late 1960s brought his work to wider audiences. In 1970, he began intensive studies under Hindustani singer Pandit Pran Nath, whom he often accompanied in performance. He has collaborated frequently throughout his career, most extensively with chamber ensemble the Kronos Quartet and his son, guitarist Gyan Riley.

Life
Riley was born in Colfax, California on June 24, 1935, and grew up in Redding, California. In the 1950s, he began performing as a solo pianist and studied composition at San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Conservatory, and University of California, Berkeley, studying with Seymour Shifrin and Robert Erickson. He befriended composer La Monte Young, whose earliest minimalist compositions using sustained tones were an influence; together, Young and Riley performed Riley's improvisatory composition Concert for Two Pianists and Tape Recorders in 1959–60. Riley later became involved in the experimental San Francisco Tape Music Center, working with Morton Subotnick, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, and Ramon Sender. Throughout the 1960s he also traveled frequently in Europe, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in piano bars. He also performed briefly with the Theatre of Eternal Music in New York in 1965-1966.
His most influential teacher was Pandit Pran Nath (1918–1996), a master of Indian classical voice who also taught La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, and Michael Harrison. Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and accompany him on tabla, tambura, and voice. In 1971 he joined the Mills College faculty to teach Indian classical music. Riley also cites John Cage and ""the really great chamber music groups of John Coltrane and Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Bill Evans, and Gil Evans"" as influences on his work. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at Chapman University in 2007.
Riley began his long-lasting association with the Kronos Quartet when he met their founder David Harrington while at Mills. Over the course of his career, Riley composed 13 string quartets for the ensemble, in addition to other works. He wrote his first orchestral piece, Jade Palace, in 1991, and has continued to pursue that avenue, with several commissioned orchestral compositions following. He is also currently performing and teaching both as an Indian raga vocalist and as a solo pianist.
Riley continues to perform live, and was part of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2011.

Techniques
Riley's music is usually based on improvising through a series of modal figures of different lengths. Works such as In C (1964) and the Keyboard Studies (1964–1966) demonstrate this technique. The first performance of In C was given by Steve Reich, Jon Gibson, Pauline Oliveros and Morton Subotnick. Its form was an innovation: The piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in the key of C. One performer beats a steady pulse of Cs on the piano to keep tempo. The others, in any number and on any instrument, perform these musical modules following a few loose guidelines, with the different musical modules interlocking in various ways as time goes on.
In the 1950s Riley was already working with tape loops, a technology still in its infancy at the time; he would later, with the help of a sound engineer, create what he called a ""time-lag accumulator"". He has continued manipulating tapes to musical effect, in the studio and in live performances throughout his career. An early tape loop piece titled Music for the Gift (1963) featured the trumpet playing of Chet Baker. It was during Riley's time in Paris, while composing this piece, that he conceived of and created the time-lag accumulator technique. Premiered in 1968 in the Magic Theatre Exhibition at the Nelson Atkins Gallery in Kansas City, a new version of the installation was commissioned three decades later by Lille 2004-European Capital of Culture and purchased by the Museum of Contemporary Art of Lyon. A third version was built and presented by the Schauspielhaus in Bochum in 2019.  He has composed using just intonation as well as microtones. In New York City in the mid-1960s he played with his longtime friend La Monte Young, as well as with John Cale and tabla player Angus MacLise, who were founding members of The Velvet Underground. Riley is credited as inspiring Cale's keyboard part on Lou Reed's composition ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", which was sung by German actress Nico and included on the album The Velvet Underground and Nico, recorded in 1966.
Riley's famous overdubbed electronic album A Rainbow in Curved Air (recorded 1968, released 1969) inspired many later developments in electronic music. These include Pete Townshend's organ parts on The Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and ""Baba O'Riley"", the latter named in tribute to Riley as well as to Meher Baba. Charles Hazlewood, in his BBC documentary on Minimalism (Part 1) suggests that the album 'Tubular Bells' by Mike Oldfield was also inspired by Riley's example. The English progressive rock group Curved Air, formed in 1970, took its name from the album.

Riley's collaborators have included the Rova Saxophone Quartet, Pauline Oliveros, the ARTE Quartett, and, as mentioned, the Kronos Quartet. His 1995 Lisbon Concert recording features him in a solo piano format, improvising on his own works. In the liner notes Riley cites Art Tatum, Bud Powell and Bill Evans as his piano ""heroes"", illustrating the importance of jazz to his conceptions.

Personal life
He has three children: one daughter, Colleen, and two sons, Gyan, who is a guitarist, and Shahn. He was married to Ann Riley until her death in 2015.

The Album Leaf,"The Album Leaf is an American musical project founded in San Diego, California, in 1998 by Jimmy LaValle. He is known for his use of electronics, synthesizer, and Rhodes piano. His performances often feature projected visual art.

History
Inception
The Album Leaf officially began in 1998 as the solo project of Jimmy LaValle, guitarist for San Diego, California-based post-rock instrumental band Tristeza. LaValle has also performed in several other San Diego-area bands, including The Crimson Curse, The Locust, Swing Kids, and GoGoGo Airheart.

An Orchestrated Rise to Fall
During downtime in the fall of 1998, LaValle began playing drums for San Diego band GoGoGo Airheart. Their singer and guitarist, Mike Vermillion (who later inspired the song name ""Vermillion"" on One Day I'll Be on Time), recorded LaValle doing improvised material on a Rhodes piano to a vintage Roland drum machine. This would become his first full-length album, the 10-track An Orchestrated Rise to Fall. Benjamin White of GoGoGo Airheart and Vermillion supplied synthesizers and vocals to these recordings.
Before Tristeza released Spine and Sensory on Makoto records in 1998, the band was talking with a handful of different indie record labels. One of the record labels was ""The Music Fellowship"" out of Salt Lake City, Utah. LaValle asked them if they would be interested in releasing his solo material. They accepted, and An Orchestrated Rise to Fall saw release in 1999 on CD. Later in the year, Tristeza and the Album Leaf both signed with newly started Tigerstyle Records out of New York City. A&R rep for the Tigerstyle, Mike Treff, had previously operated his own record label named Linkwork Records. Tigerstyle wanted to release the vinyl version of An Orchestrated Rise to Fall. Since it would be one of the first Tigerstyle releases, but limited to vinyl, Treff opted to make it Linkwork Record's last release instead.
LaValle played his first official The Album Leaf show at the Ché Café in the winter of 1999. Band members for this show consisted of Rafter Roberts, Jimmy Lehner (of Tristeza), Leilani Clark (of local San Diego band ""the Straight A's"", also with LaValle), Benjamin White (of GoGoGo Airheart), and John Pham.

One Day I'll Be on Time
Soon after signing with Tigerstyle Records, LaValle received his first recording advance. He used this money to buy his first computer, and purchase equipment for a home recording studio. He completed his first recordings, and those songs were released as a 4-song EP entitled In an Off White Room on Troubleman Records Unlimited. The title for the EP was named after the color of his home studio, which was in his living room. During time off from Tristeza's tour promoting Dream Signals in Full Circles in 2000, he began writing One Day I'll Be on Time.
The Album Leaf performed their second show during Tristeza's 2000 spring tour, at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. The show was at Club Deville, at a day party for online distributor Insound.com. The lineup consisted of Lavalle, Leilani Clark on guitar and keyboards, Tana Helean on keyboards, Susanna Waiche on bass, and Jay Hough (of GoGoGoAirheart) on drums. They shared the stage with Tristeza and The American Analog Set. This lineup also did a 4-week U.S. tour in the summer of 2000, with Andy Robillard (also of GoGoGo Airheart) replacing Hough on drums.
After the summer tour, LaValle took a full-time job in San Diego at the newly launched music house ""Singing Serpent"", producing jingles for television commercials. This also gave him access to a full-service recording studio. LaValle used this studio to re-record the material he had written for One Day I'll Be on Time. Rafter Roberts recorded the track ""Storyboard"", and can be heard in the beginning of the song discussing Lavalle's guitar tone. Jason Soares of San Diego band Aspects of Physics  provided drum programming for ""Vermillion"". Tristeza bandmate Christopher Sprague played guitar on ""In Between Lines"" and designed the album art. After completing this record, LaValle left Singing Serpent, saying, ""Making jingles was killing my creativity!""
One Day I'll Be on Time saw worldwide release in early 2001. Jón Þór Birgisson of Icelandic band Sigur Rós picked up the album at a record store in Reykjavík, Iceland, and asked LaValle to support their upcoming U.S. tour. This put The Album Leaf in front of new audiences and helped them gain popularity. The lineup at this point consisted of LaValle, Luis Hermosillo (of Tristeza) on bass, Nathan Delffs on keyboards and guitar, Eric Hinjosa on keyboards, and Andy Robillard still on drums. This lineup also toured the U.S. during December 2001 and the summer of 2002 without Hinojosa.
During this time, LaValle wrote two songs, ""Hungry for a Holiday"" and ""Bad Blood"", for Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes to sing on, and another two songs, ""Call in Blue"" and ""Reso"" (after future violinist Matt Resovich), for Marc Bianchi of Her Space Holiday, which began a set of 7"" singles for Better Lookings ""Collaboration Series"". This series is limited to 1,000 copies and is only available to subscribers. The Her Space Holiday collaboration would not be released until 2003.
In January 2003, The Album Leaf toured Japan for the second time. The first time had been an opening slot for LaValle's band Tristeza in the spring of 2002, where he performed with fellow band members Luis Hermosillo and Eric Hinojosa. This was a headlining tour with fellow San Diego band Ilya supporting. LaValle enlisted Duane Pitre, Matthew Baker, and Hank Morton of Ilya to back him, along with Robillard on drums.
Immediately following this tour, LaValle was offered to support Sigur Rós' European tour. On this tour he performed solo and started incorporating electronic beats and loop pedals into his live show in order to perform his songs as a one-man band. Later during this tour, Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan of Sigur Rós and Amiina respectively, began to join LaValle on stage, performing on a couple of songs during his half-hour performance slot.
Upon returning home, he had put together another lineup for supporting the U.S. portion of Sigur Rós' tour. This lineup was made up of Hermosillo, Delffs, and Tim Reece now on drums. Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan would still join them on stage. This tour saw The Album Leaf playing at music venues such as Radio City Music Hall in New York City, gaining even more popularity for the band.
After these tours, LaValle decided to leave Tristeza and focus on The Album Leaf full-time.

A Lifetime or More and the Seal Beach EP
During the following months of 2003, LaValle began recording again. He recorded 3 tracks for a split EP with New York City's, On! Air! Library! for the Arena Rock Recording Co. called A Lifetime or More. Drew Andrews provided guitar for the track ""Another Day"". During May 2003, with his new addition of electronic beats, LaValle recorded 5 songs released as the ""Seal Beach EP"" for Spanish record label Acuarela Discos.
In August 2003, The Album Leaf headlined a tour of the U.S. with fellow San Diego band Ilya. This tour introduced The Album Leaf's use of live visual projection art by Andrew Pates and the lineup went down to just LaValle and Drew Andrews on keyboards and guitar, with them incorporating laptops and Pates projecting visuals onto a backdrop of the stage. The lineup was becoming more permanent.
Following this tour, LaValle traveled to Iceland to begin recording his third full-length album. During the Sigur Rós European and U.S. tours, LaValle received an invitation from Sigur Rós to record in their Icelandic studio. During these recording sessions, The Album Leaf performed two shows in Iceland, one being a part of the Iceland Airwaves music festival with LaValle being backed by Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan of Sigur Rós and Amiina with Sindri Mar Finnbogason playing bass.
In December 2003, The Album Leaf opened for The American Analog Set on their U.S. tour. This lineup consisted of Matt Resovich on violin, Andrew Kenny (of The American Analog Set), and Sean Ripple (of The American Analog Set), with Pates doing live projections.

In a Safe Place
In January 2004, LaValle signed with Seattle-based record label Sub Pop Records and Berlin, Germany based European label City Slang Records. He completed In a Safe Place in February 2004.  Jón Þór Birgisson, Kjartan Sveinsson, and Orri Páll Dýrason (most of the members of Sigur Rós), María Huld Markan (of Amiina), Gyða Valtýsdóttir (formally of múm), Pall Jenkins, and Matt Resovich (of the Blackheart Procession) all contributed to the record with Birgir Jón ""Biggi"" Birgisson, engineering at Sigur Rós' Sundlaugin studio.
In a Safe Place was released on June 22, 2004. The Album Leaf played a record release show at M-Theory Records in San Diego with its current lineup of Matt Resovich on violin, keyboards, glockenspiel, guitar, and vocals; Drew Andrews on guitar, keyboards, and vocals; Tim Reece on drums and keyboards, with Andrew Pates projecting live visuals. Following the release, The Album Leaf toured for a year with little time off performing in the U.S., Europe, Taiwan, and Japan. During this time, they self-released the Red Tour EP which contained 5 tracks. This was to showcase the band as individuals and each member (with the exception of Reece) providing their own song; the cd is also enhanced with a tour video made by Andrew Pates. The EP also featured a live recording of ""Micro Melodies"", a song that only appeared on the soundtrack for the film Moog, a documentary about Robert Moog, the inventor of the Moog synthesizer. The track ""Over the Pond"" is also used in the film The Family Friend (L'Amico di Famiglia) by Paolo Sorrentino.
This record saw more commercial success and popularity, establishing LaValle's The Album Leaf on the map and playing to bigger audiences. Many of the tracks from In a Safe Place were used in soundtracks for television shows such as The OC and CSI: Miami.
Following extensive touring, LaValle re-joined Tristeza, filling in on guitar for two shows in Guadalajara and Mexico City in place of Alison Ables. When Ables returned, LaValle began writing his next full-length album.
In December 2005, LaValle traveled to Seattle, Washington to Bear Creek Recording Studio to begin tracking the record. After tracking, he traveled back to Sigur Rós' Sundlaugin studio to mix the record with the help of Jón Þór Birgisson and Joshua Eustis (of Telefon Tel Aviv).

Into the Blue Again
On September 12, 2006, Into the Blue Again was released on Sub Pop Records in North America. The album saw an earlier release in Germany on September 8, 2006, and throughout the rest of Europe on September 11, 2006, courtesy of City Slang Records. Into the Blue Again sees a return to The Album Leaf's conception and LaValle handling virtually all instrumental duties. LaValle's few collaborators on Into the Blue Again are Joshua Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, who aided additional drum programming and engineering on choice songs, The Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins adding vocal harmonies on ""Wherever I Go,"" violinist Matt Resovich (who performs with The Album Leaf live, and also played on In a Safe Place), and Drew Andrews adding additional guitar work on select songs (Drew also performs with The Album Leaf live). In support of the album, the band toured extensively through the United States, Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan.  Lymbyc Systym supported most of the band's US dates.
The album's first track, 'The Light', was used in advertisements for Channel 4's series of programmes Disarming Britain and the 2012 documentary film 16 Acres.  It is also heavily used in the TV series Scandal.
""Writings on the Wall"" was used in the pilot episode of Sons of Anarchy in 2008.

2008
In June 2008, the band performed an original score to F. W. Murnau's 1927 silent film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans  at the Seattle International Film Festival. These performances were held at The Triple Door in Seattle.
Also in June, they collaborated with Mike Heron of The Incredible String Band for a one-off show at the legendary 17,500-seat capacity Hollywood Bowl, opening for Gilberto Gil and Devendra Banhart.

A Chorus of Storytellers
A Chorus of Storytellers was released on February 2, 2010, on Sub Pop Records. The album was mixed by Jimmy LaValle and Birgir Jón ""Biggi"" Birgisson at Sundlaugin Studio in Iceland and mastered by Roger Seibel at SAE Mastering in Phoenix, AZ. Recording was done at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, WA and for the first time, featured a full live band. Supporting the album, the band again toured extensively between February and May through the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Notably, the band were chosen to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival curated by ATP & Portishead in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

Between Waves
The Album Leaf released their sixth full-length album, Between Waves, on August 26, 2016. It is the first album by The Album Leaf to feature the band's full current lineup. It is also the band's first release on Relapse Records, which they signed with in early 2016. The 8-song album has a greater focus on a group dynamic, having been entirely produced and recorded by LaValle and the band.
They spent the rest of 2016 touring the United States, Canada, and Europe in support of the new album. In December 2016, American webzine Somewherecold ranked Between Waves No. 5 on their ""Somewherecold Awards 2016"" list.

One Day XX
On September 17, 2021, The Album Leaf released One Day XX, a 20th-anniversary reimagining of their sophomore album, One Day I'll Be on Time.

Future Falling: 2023
In February 2023, LaValle announced that a new Album Leaf record, titled Future Falling, would be released on May 5.

The Caretaker (musician),"The Caretaker was a long-running project by English ambient musician, James Leyland Kirby (born 9 May 1974). His work as the Caretaker is characterized as exploring memory and its gradual deterioration, nostalgia, and melancholia. The project was inspired by the haunted ballroom scene in the 1980 film The Shining. His first several releases comprised treated and manipulated samples of 1930s ballroom pop recordings. Most of his album covers were painted by one of his friends, Ivan Seal.
The Caretaker's works have received critical acclaim in publications such as The Wire, The New York Times, and BBC Music.

History
1999–2003: Haunted Ballroom trilogy
Simon Reynolds refers to the Caretaker's first three releases as ""the haunted ballroom trilogy"", spanning 1999–2003: Selected Memories from the Haunted Ballroom, A Stairway to the Stars, We'll All Go Riding on a Rainbow.
Jon Fletcher described the sound as

"" instantly recognizable musical identity of British tea-room pop (dance-band and swing music from the 1920s, 1930,s and 1940s) plugged into a multitude of effects to create a Proustian Replicant inverse. It's a stranger's past relocated within your own memories, a re-imagined history from an alien past. The mannered romantic swing of a bygone era is rendered beguilingly uncanny. These first releases flitted from bursts of noise (September 1939) to gaseous ambiance (We Cannot Escape The Past) to subtly-soaked moments of outright beauty (Stardust). Despite the uncanny effect and the eeriness, there is something warmly seductive about this debut triptych. Kubrick’s film, like the best horror, still injects a thrill and is a remnant of comfort in being haunted, a strange warmth. These early forays have the allure you find in childhood ghost stories. By the time of the third release though, it was hard to imagine what more could be done with the project. Never less than beautiful, it was just hard to conceive of actually needing any more of it.""

2005–2008: Amnesia period
Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia was released in 2005 as a series of 72 free MP3 downloads. The release found much critical acclaim. Reynolds identifies it as a shift in the sound, ""disorienting in its scale and abstraction"", with his period 2005-2008 ""exploring similar zones of queasy amorphousness"". Doran also sees the album as ""a change in direction for the project conceptually, as it started to explore different aspects of memory loss as the music itself became more texturally and structurally complex.""
Jon Fletcher describes the release as ""the labyrinthian set is a k-hole for the mind. Vague clouds of noise, barely flickering signals of life, only the starkest traces of past romanticism (no matter how poignant)- nothing to cling onto."" Mark Fisher contrasts this album with the Caretaker's previous output: ""If his earlier records suggested spaces that were mildewed but still magnificent - grand hotels have gone to seed, long-abandoned ballrooms - Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia invokes sites that have deteriorated into total dereliction, where every unidentified noise is pregnant with menace.""
Persistent Repetition of Phrases combines an overt interest in amnesia and memory distortion, with a more melodic piano-centered atmosphere, with fewer recognizable samples than the Haunted Ballroom period: ""After a few minutes you realize that something is stuck...Each song is tightly looped, a single event, chasing its resignation. No development, no narrative, no story. Not every locked groove is entirely hopeless. Rosy retrospection fixates on an event with a sense of less-bereft nostalgia - the memory trap seemingly resting on a happy moment."". Kirby described it as ""a lot warmer and more gentle...Not all memories are necessarily bad or disturbing memories"". At the time, this album was seen as his masterpiece, with Kirby describing himself as ""surprised"" by the level of reception, as it was created in a ""bleak"" and difficult period of his life.

2011: Breakthrough and An Empty Bliss Beyond This World
After 2008, the Caretaker's website announced that ""work has begun on a new release for early 2010 which will shift focus completely towards the brain and brain function, recall and error"". During this time, Kirby released Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Was under his own name, which was described by Pitchfork as ""music of stasis that doesn't announce itself as much as it seeps.""
Kirby's focus at this time was on another album, and did not plan out making another Caretaker record of this kind - the album was made because of ""pure chance in action at all times."". The critical impact of An Empty Bliss Beyond This World is explored in detail on its page.
He also completed the OST for Grant Gee's film Patience (After Sebald) (2012) in this period. Kirby's score for the film uses a 1927 record of Franz Schubert's piano-and-voice-only composition Winterreise (1828) as its main audio source. It also differs from other works of the project where hissing sounds are used instead of crackles, the loops are shorter in length, and the non-musical aspects of each track (the hiss sounds) serve as the foreground of the mix.

2016–2019: Everywhere at the End of Time
After another break, the Caretaker returned with his final project, intended as an end to the Caretaker persona. He conceived of six interlinked releases, which would explore the progression of dementia stage by stage to its end. Later stages reprise loops and motifs from both earlier albums in the series, and from throughout the Caretaker's back catalogue. To immerse listeners, Kirby released each album 6 months apart.
Kirby has always been driven by innovation and frustration with his past, saying ""I can’t carry on for another ten years looping old 1920s music"" and seeking to make a final break, and expressing a quixotic desire to frustrate fans of his earlier work, describing them as ""a certain type of listener who will be buying this for a particular type of sound"". Everywhere at the End of Time is also influenced by technological changes since 1999, most notably advances in recording and mixing technology, and the new opportunities of sourcing music cuts online rather than scavenging in a physical record store.
Everywhere at the End of Time was released to wide critical acclaim.
In 2017, Kirby released Take Care. It's a Desert Out There..., following the suicide of his collaborator Mark Fisher, who was suffering from depression. It features a single track in its 48-minute runtime, with previously unreleased music by the Caretaker. Kirby's initial intention would be to give Take Care for people attending at his performance at the Barbican Hall in London. However, its high demand caused him to share it on the internet. Released in a CD, it included a message stating its proceeds would be donated to the mental health charity Mind.
Kirby's last work as the Caretaker, released alongside 2019's Stage 6, is Everywhere, an Empty Bliss, a collection of unreleased archival works.

Influences
The Caretaker describes himself as ""fascinated by memory and its recall"", as well as suggesting the project is ""a kind of audio black comedy"". As well as The Shining, The Caretaker names Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven as an influence, which also appropriates music of the era in a new way with a ""sadness in the lyrics to keep telling the story"", as well as Carnival of Souls (1962) and the music itself:

""Most of that music is about ghosts and loss as it was recorded between both the world wars. it's of a totally different era and has more or less been forgotten. Titles inspired new ideas as did the audio itself""

He cites Al Bowlly specifically, whose music is featured prominently in The Shining, as a key touchstone:

""He was the golden voice of his generation, but he was killed by a parachute mine outside his London home. Bowlly always sang as if haunted; his voice was otherworldly. It's very strange music from this time between the two world wars: optimistic, but also very much about loss and longing, ghosts and torment. It seems haunted by the spirits of those who went to the trenches and never returned""
For his work on amnesia and dementia, he also drew from books and research on the topic.
The Caretaker's original website suggested it to ""fans of the darker isolationist ambient work of modern composers such as William Basinski, Nurse with Wound, Aphex Twin, Fennesz and Brian Eno"". Fisher notes that the project is ""rooted in Britishness"", with the Caretaker generally choosing to focus on only British source material. Fletcher suggests ""Roxy Music's early weirdness""
The Caretaker sees his work as a collaborative process, stressing the importance of LUPO's mastering, the visuals of weirdcore.tv, and longtime album-artist Ivan Seal as a key part of his process. Theorist Mark Fisher had a symbiotic relationship with the Caretaker, contributing the liner notes to Theoretically Pure Antiretrograde Amnesia as well as putting his work in critical context, often taking the Caretaker as a jumping off point for his political ideas. Following Fisher's death, the Caretaker released Take Care, It's a Desert Out There as a memorial album, after one of the writer's quotes, with proceeds going to the mental health charity Mind.

Critical response
Mark Fisher played a major role in theorizing the Caretaker's sound. He names the Caretaker as a key hauntology artist, alongside ""William Basinski, the Ghost Box label...Burial, Mordant Music, Philip Jeck, amongst others"" who had ""converged on a certain terrain without directly influencing one another...suffused with an overwhelming melancholy; and they were preoccupied with how technology materialized memory"" - in the Caretaker's case, that of vinyl records. He identifies the ""crackle"" of vinyl as ""the principle sonic signature of hauntology"" which ""makes us aware that we are listening to a time that is out of joint"", signaling ""the return of a certain sense of loss"" which ""invokes the past and marks our distance from it"". Fisher connects the Caretaker's sound to his wider project of describing capitalist realism - the political idea that ""not only has the future not arrived, it no longer seems possible"", and hauntology's melancholia to capitalist realism's ""closed horizons"". Fisher contributed liner notes to Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia, describing it as ""uneasy listening""; in contrast to the Caretaker's earlier works, ""the threat is no longer the deadly sweet seduction of nostalgia. The problem is not, anymore, the longing to get *to* the past but the inability to get *out* of it"".
Jon Fletcher similarly describes his work as ""a hideously clear analysis of the post-modern condition - the sheer ephemerality of contemporary culture degenerating into a hopelessness - a sickness so debilitating that we forget the moment while it is still taking place…""
Kirby's press releases also welcome political understandings of his work. With British-born Kirby having lived and worked for many years in Berlin and Kraków, the press release for Everywhere at the End of Time compares the project to Brexit: ""Both started in 2016 and are due to wrap up in spring 2019. It should be no stretch of the imagination to read into their parallel progression from nostalgia and historic/collective amnesia, to progressive dementia and complete obliteration of (the) sense(s)""
Adam Scovell focuses on the ""spatial qualities"" of Take Care, It's a Desert Out There - contrasting it with the Caretaker's earlier evocation of old tea rooms and hotels with ""transporting the listener into a void of sorts"". He describes it as ""almost weather-like which is appropriate as depression is in some sense meteorological...Everything is dampened, nothing is spared. There is only the ""now"" when the weather is bad. Bones are damp, thoughts are damp and the dry land that others inhabit is seemingly inconceivable.""

Legacy
Jon Fletcher described the Caretaker as ""one of this decade's most innovative, heartbreaking and downright eerie musical projects has been playing to shadows under dimmed lights for the past 12 years"". Pitchfork described An Empty Bliss Beyond This World as ""the musical equivalent of a permanent smile.""
The Caretaker's final project, Everywhere at the End of Time, is amongst his best-known. The Quietus, who very frequently features Kirby's projects, named it at the top of its 100 Reissues list in 2019. In 2020, the completed Everywhere at the End of Time went viral on TikTok, with users telling one another to listen to the entire six-and-a-half-hour album series in one sitting.

The Field (musician),"Axel Willner is a Swedish electronic music producer and DJ from Stockholm and currently based in Berlin, best known for his releases as The Field, blending micro-samples of pop songs into atmospheric minimal techno.

History
Born in southern Sweden, Willner spent his formative years living in Stockholm and (for a brief time) Lisbon. As a teenager he studied at a formal music academy but cited groups like Misfits and Dead Kennedys as inspiration to pick up the guitar and play in punk bands.
Willner became enamored with the burgeoning electronic music scene in the mid-1990s. He started playing drone and Warp-influenced IDM in Stockholm venues with friend Ola Keijer (alias Ola K) as duo Speedwax. Beginning in the early 2000s, Willner produced guitar-based ambient music using multiple pseudonyms (Lars Blek, Porte, Cordouan, James Larsson) through his own Garmonbozia label, and performed alongside fellow Swedish musicians such as Andreas Tilliander, Sarah Nyberg Pergament (alias Action Biker), and longtime friend Johan Skön.
Willner began recording music under The Field moniker in 2003 as a platform to combine his early affinity for pop artists like Lionel Richie, Kate Bush, and The Four Tops with a myriad of more recent influences ranging from shoegaze bands like Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine to 1990s ambient electronica such as Seefeel  and the projects of Wolfgang Voigt (largely the acclaimed albums under Voigt's Gas handle). In 2004, he submitted a demo tape to celebrated German label Kompakt and was subsequently signed. Shortly thereafter, in early 2005, Willner debuted as The Field with a remix of Annie's single ""Heartbeat"" and also released the ""Things Keep Falling Down"" 12-inch. The 2006 release of 12-inch ""Sun & Ice"" (in addition to remixes for James Figurine and 120 Days) added to the growing anticipation for a debut LP.
Kompakt released his first album From Here We Go Sublime on March 26, 2007. The record received near-universal critical acclaim; according to Metacritic, it was the best-reviewed album of the year (tied with Untrue by UK dubstep producer Burial). Resident Advisor placed the record 29th on their list of the decade's top 100 albums. Willner himself has admitted to being surprised by the positive reception, stating that ""since it is a bit different than (most) other techno, I thought that people wouldn't like it"" and ""it ended up bigger than I ever expected.""
Later in 2007, Willner became the first musician to participate in the Sound of Light project curated by the Nordic Light Hotel, using his experience at the Stockholm hotel as basis for his EP of the same name. Also during that year he contributed remixes to artists such as Thom Yorke, Battles, and Gui Boratto.
Extensive touring in both Europe and North America supported Sublime, which included appearances at Pitchfork Music Festival, Sónar, Field Day, and All Tomorrow's Parties, as well as select dates with !!! (Chk Chk Chk). But Willner soon grew weary of his solo performances and incorporated a backing band times made up of (at various times) multi-instrumentalist Andreas Söderstrom (of Taken by Trees), bassist/keyboardist Dan Enqvist, and drummer Jesper Skarin. While this collaborative approach to live performance and songwriting in some measure recalled his time playing in rock bands, it also fostered a more organic evolution of The Field's ever-expanding sound palette. Willner abandoned any utilization of his laptop during concerts in favor of live mixing with synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines, although for studio production he has kept the Jeskola Buzz freeware that he had used since his earliest recording endeavors.
The Field's second album Yesterday and Today was released via Kompakt on 18 May 2009. Rather than adhering to the strict 4x4 techno of his debut, Willner incorporated far more diverse influences for his sophomore outing: Manuel Göttsching and 1970s Krautrock, the disco of Giorgio Moroder, the soundtrack works of director John Carpenter, and minimalist composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass. Recorded on a remote island outside of Stockholm, the studio sessions drew upon Willner's renewed interest in collaboration and thus featured contributions from many other musicians, most notably Battles drummer John Stanier on the title track. The album also included a cover of The Korgis' 1980 single ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"". Following the much-praised release were multiple festival appearances and a stateside tour with The Juan Maclean, and a remix EP with interpretations from Gold Panda, Walls, and Rainbow Arabia. ""The More That I Do"" was released as the record's lone single, backed with remixes courtesy of Thomas Fehlmann (of The Orb) and Foals.
Following the release of Yesterday and Today, Willner relocated from Stockholm to Germany and went on to produce remixes for artists such as Maserati, Bear in Heaven, Errors, and Harmonia (specifically a track from their Tracks and Traces collaboration with Brian Eno). He then joined Cologne Tape, a German-based collective including (among others) John Stanier, Jens-Uwe Beyer (Popnoname), and Michaela Dippel (Ada), whose Motorik-fueled debut entitled Render was released on 14 June 2010, on the Magazine imprint.
Kompakt issued Looping State of Mind, Willner's third LP as The Field, on 24 October 2011. The album expanded on the organic instrumentation of Yesterday and Today in its use of piano, synthesizer, bass guitar, acoustic drums, steel drums, and vibraphone (among others), while focusing on themes of memory and repetition. Keeping in line with its predecessors it garnered a considerable amount of critical praise. A remix EP followed in 2012 with contributions from Junior Boys, Blondes, and Wolfgang Voigt's latest project Mohn. Also in 2012, Willner released And Never Ending Nights as Loops of Your Heart, a more drone-inclined venture through Magazine on 13 February.
Cupid's Head, Willner's fourth LP as The Field, was released on 30 September 2013 via Kompakt. The album was a markedly darker turn in his discography and was also his first release that was solely his work since his debut. On 10 February 2014 Willner released the LP The Soul Is Quick under the alias Hands through Ecstatic Recordings. The Soul Is Quick was recorded in the spring of 2012 and is similar in style to that of Loops Of Your Heart, evolving on the drone/noise sound that was established on And Never Ending Nights.

The Fireman (band),"The Fireman is an English experimental music duo of Paul McCartney and Youth formed in 1993. Their music catalogue ranges from rock to electronica, evolving over more than two decades and three albums. Although officially anonymous until 2008 with the release of the album Electric Arguments, the group members' names had been known to the public since soon after the release of their first album.
In 1993, the Fireman released its first album, Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest, and followed that with Rushes in 1998. In 2000, Youth also took part in McCartney's similarly styled Liverpool Sound Collage. Their most recent album is Electric Arguments (2008).
In June 2008, McCartney's official website announced that a track called ""Lifelong Passion (Sail Away)"", from the album Electric Arguments, would be issued as a limited-edition download to fans who donated to the charity Adopt-A-Minefield. The album was released on the label One Little Indian on 24 November 2008. The new album features more traditional songs, in which there are vocals (the first time on any of their albums). The majority of the album's vocals come from McCartney. In February 2009, Sirius XM launched Fireman Radio, a limited-run channel dedicated to the music of the group.

History
Formation
In early 1993, Paul McCartney had finished recording the tracks for his ninth solo studio album Off the Ground and was in the process of mixing the songs. McCartney wanted some input and help from another producer, so his friend Allen Crowder recommended Youth to come into the studio. Soon after, McCartney phoned Youth about the prospects of him mixing the album, and subsequently invited him to his private Hog Hill studio in Sussex. Youth accepted the offer and the two began the process of remixing the song for the album which was eventually released in February 1993. While working together professionally for the album, McCartney and Youth also became good friends. They both felt that their musical relationship could be expanded upon further than merely focusing on McCartney's solo work, so the two began compiling material which would ultimately become Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest.

That's the whole point about The Fireman – it's very free. And also it's an approach I'm interested in. The Whole idea behind 'Sgt. Pepper's...' was to create a band, and we could pretend that we were that band and not the Beatles, so we made that record with that in mind...But it's very free – it's a very joyful way to record. Sometimes it can be pretty scary but that's OK. And it's very quick. But I enjoy the process because it's exhilarating.

Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest
The collaboration of Paul McCartney and Youth began as a mere hobby between the two. McCartney proposed to Youth that he go through the multi tracks of the recently completed Off the Ground album and sample the material in order to create some songs. Youth began making the tracks with intentions of using samples from the album, yet much of the final product had either used previous work or newly recorded material by McCartney. Youth worked on these songs' mixes for a few days while at McCartney's Sussex studio and eventually presented his work to McCartney and his wife Linda McCartney, who both stayed up all night to watch him work. As Youth recalls, McCartney told him, ""We love these mixes so much I wanna put them all out as an album."" By that point, the duo decided to officially release the album. The final product consisted of nine songs that all centered around a common musical theme and techno dance beat yet had slight underlying variations added, much like different mixes on a 12-inch single. The album, which featured only a pure red background on the cover, was the first release under the Fireman name and lacked any marks of either McCartney's or Youth's names but refers to MPL Communications. The album was released in November 1993. Shortly before the release, the true identities of the band were leaked to the press and most who bought the album were fully aware that the Fireman was a pseudonym for Paul McCartney and Youth. Although this broke the guise that McCartney wanted to have, it allowed the album to gain more attention in the music scene.

Rushes
Recording for their second studio album Rushes began in February 1998. Unlike their previous work, Rushes was not reliant on McCartney's previously released songs to create the tracks for the album. It has been released in September 1998 with positive reviews, most of which had the consensus that it improved upon their first album.

Electric Arguments
Nearly ten years passed before McCartney and Youth began creating material for their third studio album, Electric Arguments. The duo again recorded songs at McCartney's Hog Hill studio, yet did so one session at a time between 2007 and 2008. This was their first album to feature any vocals because both Youth and McCartney felt that their material needed a change; thus the genre of the band evolved from its more electronic roots to an experimental rock influence. Like their previous two albums however, McCartney played all of the instruments while Youth co-produced the tracks.The duo borrowed the title Electric Arguments from the poem ""Kansas City to St. Louis"" by Allen Ginsberg. In Wired magazine, McCartney said he had ""been looking at the beauty of word combinations rather than their meaning.""

We had a ball making this album, and it was a great departure because it seemed more like improv theatre. In the improv spirit, there are William Burroughs-type cut-ups in the lyrics.  I came to 'Sing the Changes', as well as all the other songs in the album, with absolutely no concept of what the melody or lyrics would be about. So it was like writing on the spot, which I think lent an electricity to the whole sound.
This was the Fireman's first album to be released on the independent label One Little Independent, switching from McCartney's usual EMI. This was due to McCartney's belief that major labels were not adapting to the times, referring to the newfound popularity of online music at the time such as iTunes.

Musical style/development
The Fireman began as an ambient techno group but over three albums it has morphed into an experimental rock band more reminiscent of McCartney's solo work. The duo have said that their work has been highly influenced by songs such as ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" a Lennon-McCartney track from 1966's Revolver. For the most part, the recording process for the band is very casual and spontaneous. Youth described this informal way of making songs in the online magazine Sound on Sound:""I'd bring down all these poetry books or play him some really old traditional folk music and say, 'Listen to this story and see if you can write some words.' Or I'd go, 'Take these poems and just pick out five words on that page and write a line out of those. (Laughs) And you've got 10 minutes!' And he did it!""
Although this way of recording seemed relaxed, McCartney found the process thrilling – even frightening at times – compared to the orderly style to which he is accustomed in the studio. ""If I hadn't done The Fireman,"" he said, ""I think I would wish I'd done that, because it freshened ideas up for me.""

The Guardian,"The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, before it changed its name in 1959. Along with its sister papers, The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust Limited. The trust was created in 1936 to ""secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference"". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in its journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.
The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. Since 2018, the paper's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format. As of July 2021, its print edition had a daily circulation of 105,134. The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as three international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) Guardian New Zealand (founded in 2019) and Guardian US (founded in 2011). The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion, and the term ""Guardian reader"" is used to imply a stereotype of a person with liberal, left-wing or ""politically correct"" views. Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the ""Grauniad"" in the 1970s, a nickname still occasionally used by the editors for self-mockery.
In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public's trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they ""trust what [they] see in it"". A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018. It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK's ""quality newsbrands"", including digital editions; other ""quality"" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i. While The Guardian's print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month.
Chief among the notable ""scoops"" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler's phone. The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK's best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history. In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records, and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then–Prime Minister David Cameron's links to offshore bank accounts. It has been named ""newspaper of the year"" four times at the annual British Press Awards: most recently in 2014, for its reporting on government surveillance.

History
1821 to 1972
Early years
The Manchester Guardian was founded in Manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor with backing from the Little Circle, a group of non-conformist businessmen. They launched the paper, on 5 May 1821 (by chance the very day of Napoleon's death) after the police closure of the more radical Manchester Observer, a paper that had championed the cause of the Peterloo Massacre protesters. Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers, writing: ""They have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow-countrymen, from whose ill-requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence. They do not toil, neither do they spin, but they live better than those that do."" When the government closed down the Manchester Observer, the mill-owners' champions had the upper hand.
The influential journalist Jeremiah Garnett joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper, and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper. The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would ""zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty ... warmly advocate the cause of Reform ... endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and ... support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures"". In 1825, the paper merged with the British Volunteer and was known as The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer until 1828.
The working-class Manchester and Salford Advertiser called The Manchester Guardian ""the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the mill-owners"". The Manchester Guardian was generally hostile to labour's claims. Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill, the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition ""the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure."" The Manchester Guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators, stating that ""if an accommodation can be effected, the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone. They live on strife ... .""
In March 2023, an academic review commissioned by the Scott Trust determined that John Edward Taylor and nine of his eleven backers had links to the Atlantic slave trade through their interests in Manchester's textile industry.

Slavery and the American Civil War
The newspaper opposed slavery and supported free trade. An 1823 leading article on the continuing ""cruelty and injustice"" to slaves in the West Indies long after the abolition of the slave trade with the Slave Trade Act 1807 wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves. It welcomed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and accepted the ""increased compensation"" to the planters as the ""guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation"" rather than individuals. Success of the Act would encourage emancipation in other slave-owning nations to avoid ""imminent risk of a violent and bloody termination."" However, the newspaper argued against restricting trade with countries that had not yet abolished slavery.
Complex tensions developed in the United States. When the abolitionist George Thompson toured, the newspaper said that ""[s]lavery is a monstrous evil, but civil war is not a less one; and we would not seek the abolition even of the former through the imminent hazard of the latter"". It suggested that the United States should compensate slave-owners for freeing slaves and called on President Franklin Pierce to resolve the 1856 ""civil war"", the Sacking of Lawrence due to pro-slavery laws imposed by Congress.
In 1860, The Observer quoted a report that the newly elected president Abraham Lincoln was opposed to abolition of slavery. On 13 May 1861, shortly after the start of the American Civil War, the Manchester Guardian portrayed the Northern states as primarily imposing a burdensome trade monopoly on the Confederate States, arguing that if the South was freed to have direct trade with Europe, ""the day would not be distant when slavery itself would cease"". Therefore, the newspaper asked ""Why should the South be prevented from freeing itself from slavery?"" This hopeful view was also held by the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone.

There was division in Britain over the Civil War, even within political parties. The Manchester Guardian had also been conflicted. It had supported other independence movements and felt it should also support the rights of the Confederacy to self-determination. It criticised Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation for not freeing all American slaves. On 10 October 1862, it wrote: ""It is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and well-intentioned as Mr Lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for America and the world, when he was chosen President of the United States"". By then, the Union blockade was causing suffering in British towns. Some including Liverpool supported the Confederacy as did ""current opinion in all classes"" in London. On 31 December 1862, cotton workers held a meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester which resolved ""its detestation of negro slavery in America, and of the attempt of the rebellious Southern slave-holders to organise on the great American continent a nation having slavery as its basis"". There was a comment that ""an effort had been made in a leading article of the Manchester Guardian to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose"". The newspaper reported all this and published their letter to President Lincoln while complaining that ""the chief occupation, if not the chief object of the meeting, seems to have been to abuse the Manchester Guardian"". Lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their ""sublime Christian heroism"" and American ships delivered relief supplies to Britain.
The newspaper reported the shock to the community of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, concluding that ""[t]he parting of his family with the dying President is too sad for description"", but in what from today's perspective looks an ill-judged editorial wrote that ""[o]f his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty"", adding: ""it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions"".
According to Martin Kettle, writing for The Guardian in February 2011: ""The Guardian had always hated slavery. But it doubted the Union hated slavery to the same degree. It argued that the Union had always tacitly condoned slavery by shielding the southern slave states from the condemnation they deserved. It was critical of Lincoln's emancipation proclamation for stopping short of a full repudiation of slavery throughout the US. And it chastised the president for being so willing to negotiate with the south, with slavery one of the issues still on the table.""

C. P. Scott
C. P. Scott made the newspaper nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott, the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting William Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion. Scott supported the movement for women's suffrage, but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action: ""The really ludicrous position is that Mr Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people's windows and breaking up benevolent societies' meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him."" Scott thought the Suffragettes' ""courage and devotion"" was ""worthy of a better cause and saner leadership"". It has been argued that Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who ""transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society"".
Scott commissioned J. M. Synge and his friend Jack Yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland; these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara.
Scott's friendship with Chaim Weizmann played a role in the Balfour Declaration. In 1948 The Manchester Guardian was a supporter of the new State of Israel.
Ownership of the paper passed in June 1936 to the Scott Trust (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence.
From 1930 to 1967, a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in 700 zinc cases. These were found in 1988 whilst the newspaper's archives were deposited at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library, on the Oxford Road campus. The first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in August 1930 in pristine condition. The zinc cases had been made each month by the newspaper's plumber and stored for posterity. The other 699 cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at The Guardian's garage, owing to shortage of space at the library.

Spanish Civil War
Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left Liberal Party, and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). George Orwell wrote in Homage to Catalonia (1938): ""Of our larger papers, the Manchester Guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty"". With the pro-Liberal News Chronicle, the Labour-supporting Daily Herald, the Communist Party's Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco's insurgent nationalists.

Post-war
The paper's then editor, A. P. Wadsworth, so loathed Labour's left-wing champion Aneurin Bevan, who had made a reference to getting rid of ""Tory Vermin"" in a speech ""and the hate-gospellers of his entourage"" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative in the 1951 general election and remove Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government. The newspaper opposed the creation of the National Health Service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would ""eliminate selective elimination"" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.
The Manchester Guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 Suez Crisis: ""The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow.""
On 24 August 1959, The Manchester Guardian changed its name to The Guardian. This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper. In September 1961, The Guardian, which had previously only been published in Manchester, began to be printed in London. 
Nesta Roberts was appointed as the newspaper's first news editor there, becoming the first woman to hold such a position on a British national newspaper.

1972 to 2000
The Troubles
During the early period of the Troubles, The Guardian supported British state intervention to quell disturbances between Irish Catholics and Ulster loyalists in Northern Ireland. After the Battle of the Bogside between Catholic residents of Derry and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), The Guardian called for the British Armed Forces to be deployed to the region, arguing that their deployment would ""present a more disinterested face of law and order"" than the RUC.""
On 30 January 1972, troops from the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment opened fire on a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march, killing fourteen people in an event that would come to be known as Bloody Sunday. In response to the incident, The Guardian argued that ""Neither side can escape condemnation... The organizers of the demonstration, Miss Bernadette Devlin among them, deliberately challenged the ban on marches. They knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented, and that the IRA might use the crowd as a shield."" The Guardian further stated that ""It is certainly true that the army cordons had endured a wanton barrage of stones, steel bars, and other missiles. That still does not justify opening fire so freely.""
After the events of Bloody Sunday, John Widgery, Baron Widgery was appointed the head of a tribunal to investigate the killings. The resulting tribunal, known as the Widgery Tribunal, largely exonerated the actions of the soldiers involved in the incident. The Guardian published an article on 20 April 1972 which supported the tribunal and its findings, arguing that ""Widgery's report is not one-sided"". In response to the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland, The Guardian argued that ""Internment without trial is hateful, repressive and undemocratic. In the existing Irish situation, most regrettably, it is also inevitable... To remove the ringleaders, in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down, is a step to which there is no obvious alternative.""

Sarah Tisdall
In 1983, the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in Britain that were leaked to The Guardian by civil servant Sarah Tisdall. The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall, though she served only four. ""I still blame myself"", said Peter Preston, who was the editor of The Guardian at the time, but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it ""believed in the rule of law"". In a 2019 article discussing Julian Assange and the protection of sources by journalists, John Pilger criticised the editor of The Guardian for betraying Tisdall by choosing not to go to prison ""on a fundamental principle of protecting a source"".

Alleged penetration by Russian intelligence
In 1994, KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky identified Guardian literary editor Richard Gott as ""an agent of influence"". While Gott denied that he received cash, he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits. Gott resigned from his post.
Gordievsky commented on the newspaper: ""The KGB loved The Guardian. It was deemed highly susceptible to penetration.""

Jonathan Aitken
In 1995, both the Granada Television programme World in Action and The Guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, for their allegation that Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris, which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part. Aitken publicly stated that he would fight with ""the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play"". The court case proceeded, and in 1997 The Guardian produced evidence that Aitken's claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue. In 1999, Aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.

Connection
In May 1998, a series of Guardian investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a much-garlanded ITV documentary The Connection, produced by Carlton Television.
The documentary purported to film an undiscovered route by which heroin was smuggled into the United Kingdom from Colombia. An internal inquiry at Carlton found that The Guardian's allegations were in large part correct and the then industry regulator, the ITC, punished Carlton with a record £2 million fine for multiple breaches of the UK's broadcasting codes. The scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production.
Later in June 1998, The Guardian revealed further fabrications in another Carlton documentary from the same director.

Kosovo War
The paper supported NATO's military intervention in the Kosovo War in 1998–1999. The Guardian stated that ""the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force"". Mary Kaldor's piece was headlined ""Bombs away! But to save civilians, we must get in some soldiers too.""

Since 2000
In the early 2000s, The Guardian challenged the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Treason Felony Act 1848. In October 2004, The Guardian published a humorous column by Charlie Brooker in its entertainment guide, the final sentence of which was viewed by some as a call for violence against U.S. President George W. Bush; after a controversy, Brooker and the paper issued an apology, saying the ""closing comments were intended as an ironic joke, not as a call to action"". Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, The Guardian published an article on its comment pages by Dilpazier Aslam, a 27-year-old British Muslim and journalism trainee from Yorkshire. Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist group, and had published a number of articles on their website. According to the newspaper, it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee, though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper. The Home Office said that the group's ""ultimate aim is the establishment of an Islamic state (Caliphate), according to Hizb ut-Tahrir via non-violent means"". The Guardian asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and, when he did not do so, terminated his employment.

In early 2009, The Guardian started a tax investigation into a number of major UK companies, including publishing a database of the tax paid by the FTSE 100 companies. Internal documents relating to Barclays Bank's tax avoidance were removed from The Guardian website after Barclays obtained a gagging order. The newspaper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the News of the World phone hacking affair. The Economist's Intelligent Life magazine opined that: As Watergate is to the Washington Post, and thalidomide to the Sunday Times, so phone-hacking will surely be to The Guardian: a defining moment in its history.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict coverage
In recent decades, The Guardian has been accused of biased criticism of Israeli government policy and of bias against the Palestinians. In December 2003, columnist Julie Burchill cited ""striking bias against the state of Israel"" as one of the reasons she left the paper for The Times.
Responding to these accusations, a Guardian editorial in 2002 condemned antisemitism and defended the paper's right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken. Harriet Sherwood, then The Guardian's foreign editor, later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied that The Guardian has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, The Guardian's readers' editor, wrote that ""Guardian reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel"", citing recent cases where The Guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel. Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.
The Guardian's style guide section referred to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel in 2012. In 2012, media watchdog HonestReporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) after The Guardian ran a correction apologizing for ""wrongly"" having called Jerusalem as Israel's capital. After an initial ruling supporting The Guardian, the PCC retracted its original ruling, leading to the newspaper's acknowledgement that it was wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital.The Guardian later clarified: ""In 1980, the Israeli Knesset enacted a law designating the city of Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, as the country's capital. In response, the UN security council issued resolution 478, censuring the ""change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem"" and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw. The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions, and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv. While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv – the country's financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital. The style guide has been amended accordingly.""
On 11 August 2014 the print edition of The Guardian published a pro-Israeli advocacy advert during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict featuring Elie Wiesel, headed by the words ""Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago. Now it's Hamas' turn."" The Times had decided against running the ad, although it had already appeared in major American newspapers. One week later, Chris Elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter.
In October 2023, The Guardian stated it would not renew the contract of cartoonist Steve Bell after he submitted a cartoon featuring Netanyahu, with his shirt open, wearing boxing gloves and holding a scalpel over a dotted shape of the Gaza Strip on his stomach. The caption read: ""Residents of Gaza, get out now."" Due to what has been seen by some as a reference to Shakespeare's Shylock's ""pound of flesh"", it prompted accusations that it was antisemitic. Bell said that he was inspired by the 1960s ""Johnson's Scar"" cartoon by David Levine of U.S. president Lyndon B Johnson within the context of the Vietnam War.

Clark County
In August 2004, for the US presidential election, the daily G2 supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in Clark County, Ohio, an average-sized county in a swing state. Editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against President George W. Bush. Katz admitted later that he did not believe Democrats who warned that the campaign would benefit Bush and not opponent John Kerry. The newspaper scrapped ""Operation Clark County"" on 21 October 2004 after first publishing a column of responses—nearly all of them outraged—to the campaign under the headline ""Dear Limey assholes"". Some commentators suggested that the public's dislike of the campaign contributed to Bush's victory in Clark County.

Guardian America and Guardian US
In 2007, the paper launched Guardian America, an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9 million. The company hired former American Prospect editor, New York magazine columnist and New York Review of Books writer Michael Tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors. The site featured news from The Guardian that was relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.
Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of Guardian America in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff. He retained his position as a columnist and blogger, taking the title editor-at-large.
In October 2009, the company abandoned the Guardian America homepage, instead directing users to a US news index page on the main Guardian website. The following month, the company laid off six American employees, including a reporter, a multimedia producer and four web editors. The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company. In subsequent years, however, The Guardian has hired various commentators on US affairs including Ana Marie Cox, Michael Wolff, Naomi Wolf, Glenn Greenwald and George W. Bush's former speechwriter Josh Treviño. Treviño's first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in June 2011 over the second Gaza flotilla, the controversy which had been revived by the appointment.
Guardian US launched in September 2011, led by editor-in-chief Janine Gibson, which replaced the previous Guardian America service. After a period during which Katharine Viner served as the US editor-in-chief before taking charge of Guardian News and Media as a whole, Viner's former deputy, Lee Glendinning, was appointed to succeed her as head of the American operation at the beginning of June 2015.

Gagged from reporting Parliament
In October 2009, The Guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week. The newspaper noted that it was being ""forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret. The only fact The Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck."" The paper further claimed that this case appears ""to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 Bill of Rights"".
The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP, in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura. The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company's September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal, which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader's internal emails. The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, as Carter-Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court. Alan Rusbridger attributed the rapid back-down by Carter-Ruck to postings on Twitter, as did a BBC News Online article.

Edward Snowden leaks and intervention by the UK government
In June 2013, the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of Verizon telephone records held by Barack Obama's administration and subsequently revealed the existence of the PRISM surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The Guardian said a DSMA-Notice had been sent to editors and journalists on 7 June after the first Guardian story about the Snowden documents. It said the DSMA-Notice was being used as an ""attempt to censor coverage of surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in the UK and US"".
The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government's Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, under instruction from Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed. The Guardian's offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK's GCHQ, who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden. The Guardian said it had destroyed the hard drives to avoid threatened legal action by the UK government that could have stopped it from reporting on US and British government surveillance contained in the documents. In June 2014, The Register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a ""beyond top secret"" internet monitoring base in Seeb, Oman, and the close involvement of BT and Cable & Wireless in intercepting internet communications. Julian Assange criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance. Rusbridger had initially covered the Snowden documents without the government's supervision, but subsequently sought it, and established an ongoing relationship with the Defence Ministry. The Guardian coverage of Snowden later continued because the information had already been copied outside the United Kingdom, earning the company's US website, The Guardian US, an American Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2014. Rusbridger and subsequent chief editors would sit on the government's DSMA-notice board.

Treatment of Julian Assange
The Guardian published the US diplomatic cables files and the Guantanamo Bay files in collaboration with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. When some of the diplomatic cables were made available online in unredacted form, WikiLeaks blamed Guardian journalists David Leigh  and Luke Harding for publishing the encryption key to the files in their book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy. The Guardian blamed Assange for the release of the unredacted cables.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald, a former contributor to The Guardian, accused The Guardian of publishing false claims about Assange in a report about an interview Assange gave to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. The Guardian article had claimed that Assange had praised Donald Trump and criticised Hillary Clinton and also alleged that Assange had ""long had a close relationship with the Putin regime"". Greenwald wrote: ""This article is about how those [Guardian's] false claims—fabrications, really—were spread all over the internet by journalists, causing hundreds of thousands of people (if not millions) to consume false news"". The Guardian later amended its article about Assange to remove the claim about his connection to the Russian government. While Assange was in the Ecuadorian embassy, The Guardian published a number of articles pushing the narrative that there was a link between Assange and the Russian government.
In a November 2018 Guardian article, Luke Harding and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret meetings with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and 2016. The name of a third author, Fernando Villavicencio, was removed from the online version of the story soon after publication. The title of the story was originally 'Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy'. A few hours after publication, 'sources say' was added to the title, and the meeting became an 'apparent meeting'. One reporter characterised the story, ""If it's right, it might be the biggest get this year. If it's wrong, it might be the biggest gaffe."" Manafort and Assange both said they had never met, with the latter threatening legal action against The Guardian. Ecuador's London consul Fidel Narváez, who had worked at Ecuador's embassy in London from 2010 to July 2018, said that Manafort had not visited Assange. Serge Halimi said Harding had a personal grievance against Assange and noted that Manafort's name does not appear in the Ecuadorian embassy's visitors' book and there were no pictures of Manafort entering or leaving ""one of the most surveilled and filmed buildings on the planet"". 
The Guardian has neither retracted nor apologised for the story about the meeting. Stella Moris, Assange's wife, said The Guardian failed in its responsibility to Assange and its ""negligence has created such a problem that if Julian dies or is extradited, that will forever blot the reputation of the Guardian"".

Priti Patel cartoon
The Guardian was accused of being ""racist and misogynistic"" after it published a cartoon depicting Home Secretary, Priti Patel as a cow with a ring in its nose in an alleged reference to her Hindu faith, since cows are considered sacred in Hinduism.

Alleged WhatsApp backdoor
After publishing a story on 13 January 2017 claiming that WhatsApp had a ""backdoor [that] allows snooping on messages"", more than 70 professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for The Guardian to retract the article. On 13 June 2017, readers' editor Paul Chadwick released an article detailing the flawed reporting in the original January article, which was amended to remove references to a backdoor.

Spanish-language edition
In January 2021, The Guardian began publishing in the Spanish language under the La Lista newspaper.

2022 Cyber attack
In December 2022 it was reported that the Guardian had suffered a significant cyber-attack on its office systems, thought to be ransomware. Staff were directed to work from home and were able to continue publishing to the website despite the loss of some internal systems. The print edition also continued to be produced. On 4 January 2023, UK staff were informed of a security breach and that the Information Commissioner's Office had been notified, as required by GDPR.  It was indicated that staff would continue working from home until at least 23 January. The newspaper confirmed on 11 January that personal details of all UK staff had been accessed by criminals.

Cyprus Confidential
In November 2023, the Guardian joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Paper Trail Media and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the 'Cyprus Confidential' report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation's findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

Ownership and finances
The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group (GMG) of newspapers, radio stations and print media. GMG components include The Observer, The Guardian Weekly and TheGuardian.com. All were owned by The Scott Trust, a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper's editorial independence in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to takeovers by commercial media groups. At the beginning of October 2008, the Scott Trust's assets were transferred to a new limited company, The Scott Trust Limited, with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up. Dame Liz Forgan, chair of the Scott Trust, reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements.

The Guardian is the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental audit in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company. It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the ""readers' editor"") to handle complaints and corrections.
The Guardian and its parent groups participate in Project Syndicate and intervened in 1995 to save the Mail & Guardian in South Africa; GMG sold the majority of its shares of the Mail & Guardian in 2002.
The Guardian was consistently loss-making until 2019. The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes The Observer, reported operating losses of £49.9 million in 2006, up from £18.6 million in 2005. The paper was therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group.
The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor Trinity Mirror in March 2010. This included the flagship Manchester Evening News, and severed the historic link between that paper and The Guardian. The sale was in order to safeguard the future of The Guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust.
In June 2011 Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of £33 million and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features. It was also speculated that The Guardian might become the first British national daily paper to be fully online.
For the three years up to June 2012, the paper lost £100,000 a day, which prompted Intelligent Life to question whether The Guardian could survive.
Between 2007 and 2014 The Guardian Media Group sold all their side businesses, of regional papers and online portals for classifieds, and consolidated into The Guardian as sole product. The sales let them acquire a capital stock of £838.3 million as of July 2014, supposed to guarantee the independence of the Guardian in perpetuity. In the first year, the paper made more losses than predicted, and in January 2016 the publishers announced that The Guardian would cut 20 per cent of staff and costs within the next three years. The newspaper is rare in calling for direct contributions ""to deliver the independent journalism the world needs.""
The Guardian Media Group's 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated some significant changes occurring. Its digital (online) editions accounted for over 50% of group revenues by that time; the loss from news and media operations was £18.6 million, 52% lower than during the prior year (2017: £38.9 million). The Group had cut costs by £19.1 million, partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format. The Guardian Media Group's owner, the Scott Trust Endowment Fund, reported that its value at the time was £1.01 billion (2017: £1.03 billion). In the following financial report (for the year 2018–2019), the group reported a profit (EBITDA) of £0.8 million before exceptional items, thus breaking even in 2019.
To be sustainable, the annual subsidy must fall within the £25 million of interest returned on the investments from the Scott Trust Endowment Fund.

""Membership"" subscription scheme
In 2014, The Guardian launched a membership scheme. The scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by The Guardian without introducing a paywall, thus maintaining open access to the website. Website readers can pay a monthly subscription, with three tiers available. As of 2018 this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019.

Foundation funding
In 2016, the company established a U.S.-based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations. The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues. By the following year, the organization had raised $1 million from the likes of Pierre Omidyar's Humanity United, the Skoll Foundation, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to finance reporting on topics including modern-day slavery and climate change. The Guardian has stated that it has secured $6 million ""in multi-year funding commitments"" thus far.
The new project developed from funding relationships which the paper already had with the Ford, Rockefeller, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates had given the organization $5 million for its Global Development webpage.
As of March 2020, the journal claims to be ""the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.""

Political stance and editorial opinion
Founded by textile traders and merchants, in its early years The Guardian had a reputation as ""an organ of the middle class"", or in the words of C. P. Scott's son Ted, ""a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last"". Associated at first with the Little Circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the Whigs and later by the Liberal Party, its political orientation underwent a decisive change after World War II, leading to a gradual alignment with Labour and the political left in general.
The Scott Trust describes one of its ""core purposes"" to be ""to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition"". The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion: a MORI poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour Party voters; according to another MORI poll taken in 2005, 48 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour voters and 34 per cent Liberal Democrat voters. The term ""Guardian reader"" can be used to imply a stereotype of liberal, left-wing or ""politically correct"" views.
Although the paper is often considered to be ""linked inextricably"" to the Labour Party, three of The Guardian's four leader writers joined the more centrist Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1981. The paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party, and to be elected Prime Minister. On 19 January 2003, two months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an Observer Editorial said: ""Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option. ... War with Iraq may yet not come, but, conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the British Government, we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force."" The Guardian, however, opposed the war, along with the Daily Mirror and The Independent.
Then Guardian features editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that ""it is no secret we are a centre-left newspaper"". In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of ""right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc,"" and that the newspaper was ""clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive"". She also said that ""you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian's stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it helps that there isn't one) but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper"". The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove. Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy. ""I write for the Guardian,"" said Max Hastings in 2005, ""because it is read by the new establishment,"" reflecting the paper's then-growing influence.
In the run-up to the 2010 general election, following a meeting of the editorial staff, the paper declared its support for the Liberal Democrats, due in particular, to the party's stance on electoral reform. The paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a Conservative victory, given Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system. At the 2015 election, the paper switched its support to the Labour Party. The paper argued that Britain needed a new direction and Labour ""speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice, standing up to predatory capitalism, on investment for growth, on reforming and strengthening the public realm, Britain's place in Europe and international development"".
Assistant Editor Michael White, in discussing media self-censorship in March 2011, says: ""I have always sensed liberal, middle class ill-ease in going after stories about immigration, legal or otherwise, about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class, which is more easily ignored altogether. Toffs, including royal ones, Christians, especially popes, governments of Israel, and U.S. Republicans are more straightforward targets.""
In a 2013 interview for NPR, The Guardian's Latin America correspondent Rory Carroll stated that many editors at The Guardian believed and continue to believe that they should support Hugo Chávez ""because he was a standard-bearer for the left"".
In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, it endorsed the Labour Party.
In the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, The Guardian supported Blairite candidate Yvette Cooper and was critical of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, the successful candidate. These positions were criticised by the Morning Star, which accused The Guardian of being conservative. Although the majority of Guardian columnists were against Corbyn winning, Owen Jones, Seumas Milne, and George Monbiot wrote supportive articles about him. Despite the critical position of the paper in general, The Guardian endorsed the Labour Party while Corbyn was its leader in the 2017 and 2019 general elections — although in both cases they endorsed a vote for opposition parties other than Labour, such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party in seats where Labour did not stand a chance.
In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, The Guardian endorsed remaining in the EU, and in the 2019 European election invited its readers to vote for pro-EU candidates, without endorsing specific parties.

Circulation and format
The Guardian had a certified average daily circulation of 204,222 copies in December 2012 — a drop of 11.25 per cent in January 2012 — as compared to sales of 547,465 for The Daily Telegraph, 396,041 for The Times, and 78,082 for The Independent. In March 2013, its average daily circulation had fallen to 193,586, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Circulation has continued to decline and stood at 161,091 in December 2016, a decline of 2.98 per cent year-on-year. In July 2021, the circulation was 105,134; later that year, the publishers stopped making circulation data public.

Publication history
The first edition was published on 5 May 1821, at which time The Guardian was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7d; the stamp duty on newspapers (4d per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836, The Guardian added a Wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.
In October 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: ""It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion.""
Following the closure of the Anglican Church Newspaper, The Guardian, in 1951, the paper dropped ""Manchester"" from its title in 1959, becoming simply The Guardian. In 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable Manchester Evening News. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with The Times. The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s.
On 12 February 1988, The Guardian had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an italic Garamond ""The"", with a bold Helvetica ""Guardian"", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.
In 1992, The Guardian relaunched its features section as G2, a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other ""quality"" broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of ""compact"" papers and The Guardian's move to the Berliner format. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet price war started by Rupert Murdoch's The Times. In June 1993, The Guardian bought The Observer from Lonrho, thus gaining a serious Sunday sister newspaper with similar political views.
Its international weekly edition is now titled The Guardian Weekly, though it retained the title Manchester Guardian Weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including Le Monde and The Washington Post. The Guardian Weekly was also linked to a website for expatriates, Guardian Abroad, which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.

Moving to the Berliner paper format
The Guardian is printed in full colour, and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the Berliner format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).
In 2004, The Guardian announced plans to change to a Berliner or ""midi"" format, similar to that used by Die Tageszeitung in Germany, Le Monde in France and many other European papers. At 470×315 mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed moves by The Independent and The Times to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday, 1 September 2005, The Guardian announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005. Sister Sunday newspaper The Observer also changed to this new format on 8 January 2006.
The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by Mark Porter, the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it was described as ""one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper"". Among the fonts is Guardian Egyptian, a slab serif that is used in various weights for both text and headlines, and is central to the redesign.
The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This switch was necessary because, before The Guardian's move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications, as one of the paper's presses was part-owned by Telegraph Newspapers and Express Newspapers, contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group's north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

Reception
The new format was generally well received by Guardian readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the Doonesbury cartoon strip. The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. G2 supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, ""I'm sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address—so cross."" However, some readers were dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section meant coverage of late-finishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.
The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise. In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6 per cent higher than the figure for December 2004. However, by December 2012, circulation had dropped to 204,222. In 2006, the US-based Society for News Design chose The Guardian and Polish daily Rzeczpospolita as the world's best-designed newspapers—from among 389 entries from 44 countries.

Tabloid format since 2018
In June 2017, Guardian Media Group (GMG) announced that The Guardian and The Observer would relaunch in tabloid format from early 2018. The Guardian confirmed the launch date for the new format to be 15 January 2018. GMG also signed a contract with Trinity Mirror – the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and Sunday People – to outsource printing of The Guardian and The Observer.
The format change is intended to help cut costs as it allows the paper to be printed by a wider array of presses, and outsourcing the printing to presses owned by Trinity Mirror is expected to save millions of pounds annually. The move is part of a three-year plan that includes cutting 300 jobs in an attempt to reduce losses and break even by 2019. The paper and ink are the same as previously and the font size is fractionally larger.
An assessment of the response from readers in late April 2018 indicated that the new format had led to an increased number of subscriptions. The editors were working on changing aspects that had caused complaints from readers.
In July 2018, the masthead of the new tabloid format was adjusted to a dark blue.

Online media
The Guardian and its Sunday sibling The Observer publish all their news online, with free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories. A third of the site's hits are for items over a month old. As of May 2013, it was the most popular UK newspaper website with 8.2 million unique visitors per month, just ahead of Mail Online with 7.6 million unique monthly visitors. In April 2011, MediaWeek reported that The Guardian was the fifth most popular newspaper site in the world. Journalists use an analytics tool called Ophan, built entirely in-house, to measure website data around stories and audience. However, the number of online readers had drastically dropped by July 2021.
The Guardian launched an iOS mobile application for its content in 2009. An Android app followed in 2011. In 2018, the newspaper announced its apps and mobile website would be redesigned to coincide with its relaunch as a tabloid.
The Comment is Free section features columns by the paper's journalists and regular commentators, as well as articles from guest writers, including readers' comments and responses below. The section includes all the opinion pieces published in the paper itself, as well as many others that only appear online. Censorship is exercised by Moderators who can ban posts – with no right of appeal – by those who they feel have overstepped the mark. The Guardian has taken what they call a very ""open"" stance in delivering news, and have launched an open platform for their content. This allows external developers to easily use Guardian content in external applications, and even to feed third-party content back into the Guardian network. The Guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy until they were closed on Friday, 25 February 2011 after they had settled a libel action brought after months of harassment of a conservative party activist. They were spoofed in The Guardian's own regular humorous Chatroom column in G2. The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on permachat.co.uk, a real URL that pointed to The Guardian's talkboards.
In August 2013, a webshow titled Thinkfluencer was launched by Guardian Multimedia in association with Arte.
In 2004 the paper also launched a dating website, Guardian Soulmates. On 1 July 2020, Guardian Soulmates was closed down with the explanation: ""It hasn't been an easy decision to make, but the online dating world is a very different place to when we first launched online in July 2004. There are so many dating apps now, so many ways to meet people, which are often free and very quick."" An American version of the website titled Guardian America was an American version of the British news website Guardian Unlimited intended to win more U.S.-based readers. It was abandoned in October 2009. The Guardian launched an .onion version of its website on the Tor network in May 2022, with assistance from Alec Muffett.

Podcasts
The paper entered podcasting in 2005 with a twelve-part weekly podcast series by Ricky Gervais. In January 2006, Gervais' show topped the iTunes podcast chart having been downloaded by two million listeners worldwide, and was scheduled to be listed in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records as the most downloaded podcast.
The Guardian now offers several regular podcasts made by its journalists. One of the most prominent is Today in Focus, a daily news podcast hosted by Anushka Asthana and launched on 1 November 2018. It was an immediate success and became one of the UK's most-downloaded podcasts.

GuardianFilms
In 2003, The Guardian started the film production company GuardianFilms, headed by journalist Maggie O'Kane. Much of the company's output is documentary made for television– and it has included Salam Pax's Baghdad Blogger for BBC Two's daily flagship Newsnight, some of which have been shown in compilations by CNN International, Sex on the Streets and Spiked, both made for the UK's Channel 4 television.
GuardianFilms has received several broadcasting awards. In addition to two Amnesty International Media Awards in 2004 and 2005, The Baghdad Blogger: Salam Pax won a Royal Television Society Award in 2005. Baghdad: A Doctor's Story won an Emmy Award for Best International Current Affairs film in 2007. In 2008, photojournalist Sean Smith's Inside the Surge won the Royal Television Society award for best international news film – the first time a newspaper has won such an award. The same year, The Guardian's Katine website was awarded for its outstanding new media output at the One World Media awards. Again in 2008, GuardianFilms' undercover video report revealing vote rigging by Robert Mugabe's ZANU–PF party during the 2007 Zimbabwe election won best news programme of the year at the Broadcast Awards.

References in popular culture
The paper's nickname The Grauniad (sometimes abbreviated as ""Graun"") originated with the satirical magazine Private Eye. This anagram played on The Guardian's early reputation for frequent typographical errors, including misspelling its own name as The Gaurdian.
The first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors, including a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction. Fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hot-metal typesetting. One Guardian writer, Keith Devlin, suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints' greater frequency. The newspaper was printed in Manchester until 1961 and the fact that the prints sent to London by train were the early, more error-prone, prints may have contributed to this image as well. When John Cole was appointed news editor by Alastair Hetherington in 1963, he sharpened the paper's comparatively ""amateurish"" setup.
Employees of The Guardian and sister paper The Observer have been depicted in the films The Fifth Estate (2013), Snowden (2016) and Official Secrets (2019), while Paddy Considine played a fictional Guardian journalist in the film The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).

Guardian News & Media archive
The Guardian and its sister newspaper The Observer opened The Newsroom, an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002. The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom's activities were all transferred to Kings Place in 2008. Now known as The Guardian News & Media archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of The Guardian and The Observer, and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers. This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. An extensive Manchester Guardian archive also exists at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library, and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. Additionally, the British Library has a large archive of The Manchester Guardian available in its British Library Newspapers collection, in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM formats.
In November 2007, The Guardian and The Observer made their archives available over the internet via DigitalArchive. The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for The Guardian and 1791 to 2000 for The Observer: these archives will eventually run up to 2003.
The Newsroom's other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008. The Guardian's Education Centre provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults. The Guardian's exhibition space was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism. This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM Archive.

The KLF,"The KLF (also known as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, the JAMs, the Timelords and other names) are a British electronic band who originated in Liverpool and London in the late 1980s. Scottish musician Bill Drummond (alias King Boy D) and English musician Jimmy Cauty (alias Rockman Rock) began by releasing hip hop-inspired and sample-heavy records as the JAMs. As the Timelords, they recorded the British number-one single ""Doctorin' the Tardis"", and documented the process of making a hit record in a book The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way). As the KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered stadium house (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and, with their 1990 LP Chill Out, the ambient house genre. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991.
From the outset, the KLF adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novels The Illuminatus! Trilogy, making anarchic situationist manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of cryptic advertisements in New Music Express (NME) and the mainstream press, as well as unusual performances on Top of the Pops. In collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror at the BRIT Awards in February 1992, they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance pre-announced the KLF's departure from the music business and, in May of that year, they deleted their entire back-catalogue. Drummond and Cauty established the K Foundation and sought to subvert the art world, staging an alternative art award for the Worst Artist of the Year, and burning one million pounds sterling (approximately £2.35m as of 2022).
The duo have released a small number of new tracks since 1992, as the K Foundation, the One World Orchestra, and in 1997, as 2K. Drummond and Cauty reappeared in 2017 as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, releasing the novel 2023, and rebooting an earlier campaign to build a ""People's Pyramid"". In January 2021, the band began uploading their previously deleted catalogue onto streaming services, in compilations.

History
Background
Bill Drummond was an established figure within the British music industry, having co-founded Zoo Records, played guitar in the Liverpool band Big in Japan, and worked as manager of Echo & the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. Artist and musician Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in the three-piece Brilliant – an act that Drummond had signed to WEA Records and managed.
In July 1986, Drummond resigned from his position as an A&R man at record label WEA, citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ revolutions per minute being the speed at which a vinyl LP revolves), and that it was ""time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top"". In the same year he released a solo LP, The Man. Drummond intended to focus on writing books once The Man had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, ""That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all"". Recalling that moment in a later interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant: he would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Cauty, and they would be called the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu:

It was New Year's Day... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought ""I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?"". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said ""Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu"". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, ""where I was coming from""... Within a week we had recorded our first single

The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu
Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos – King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively – and adopted the name the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group ""The Justified Ancients of Mummu"" from The Illuminatus! Trilogy. The JAMs' primary instrument was the digital sampler with which they would plagiarise the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary beatbox rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's raps, of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery.
The JAMs' debut single ""All You Need Is Love"" dealt with the media coverage given to AIDS, sampling heavily from the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love"" and Samantha Fox's ""Touch Me (I Want Your Body)"". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided white label 12"" were sent to the music press; it received positive reviews and was made ""single of the week"" in Sounds. A later piece in the same magazine called the JAMs ""the hottest, most exhilarating band this year .... It's hard to understand what it feels like to come across something you believe to be totally new; I have never been so wholeheartedly convinced that a band are so good and exciting.""
The JAMs re-edited and re-released ""All You Need Is Love"" in May 1987, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional graffiti, defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded the JAMs with praise (including NME 's ""single of the week"") and the funds necessary to record their debut album. The album, 1987 (What the F**k Is Going On?), was released in June 1987. Included was a song called ""The Queen and I"", which sampled the ABBA single ""Dancing Queen"". After a legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society, the 1987 album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to Sweden in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an NME journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP. They failed to meet ABBA, who they didn't realize already lived in Britain at the time, so they disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the North Sea ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they ""felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified.""
Two new singles followed on the JAMs' ""KLF Communications"" independent record label. Both reflected a shift towards house rhythms. According to NME, the JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, ""Whitney Joins the JAMs"" saw them leaving behind their strategy of ""collision course"" to ""move straight onto the art of super selective theft"". The song uses samples of the Mission: Impossible and Shaft themes alongside Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"". Drummond has claimed that the KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss (Clive Davis of Arista Records) to sign with them. The second single in this sequence – Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987 – was ""Down Town"", a dance record built around a gospel choir and ""Downtown"" by 1960s star Petula Clark, with lyrics that commented on poverty and homelessness. These early works were later collected on the compilation album Shag Times.
A second album, Who Killed the JAMs?, was released in early 1988. Who Killed the JAMs? earned the duo a five-star review from Sounds magazine, who called it ""a masterpiece of pathos"".

The Timelords
In 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a 'novelty' pop single, ""Doctorin' the Tardis"" as the Timelords. The song is predominantly a mash-up of the Doctor Who theme music, ""Block Buster!"" by Sweet and Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll (Part Two)"".
Credited on the record was ""Ford Timelord"", Cauty's 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car, and ""Lord Rock"" (Cauty) and ""Time Boy"" (Drummond). The Timelords claimed that Ford Timelord was the ""Talent"" in the band and had given them instructions on how to make the record; Ford fronted the promotional campaign for the single and was ""interviewed"" on TV. The car would later be banger raced at Swaffham Raceway in 1991.
They later portrayed the song as the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single. In interviews with Snub TV and BBC Radio 1, Drummond said that they had intended to make a house record using the Doctor Who theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a Glitter beat. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was ""rancid"", ""pure, unadulterated agony"" and ""excruciating"" and from Sounds ""a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny"". A single of the Timelords' remixes of the song was released: ""Gary Joins the JAMs"" featured original vocal contributions from Glitter, who also appeared on Top of the Pops to promote the song with the Timelords. ""Doctorin' the Tardis"" sold over one million copies.
The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way), a step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent.

The KLF
By the time the JAMs' single ""Whitney Joins the JAMs"" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed ""KLF Communications"" (from the earlier The Sound of Mu(sic)). The duo's first release as the KLF was in March 1988, with the single ""Burn the Bastards""/""Burn the Beat"" (KLF 002). Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases went under the name ""The KLF"".
The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. As 'King Boy D', Drummond said in January 1988, ""We might put out a couple of 12"" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers"". King Boy D also said that he and Rockman Rock were ""pissed off at [them]selves"" for letting ""people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling."" In 1990, he recalled that ""We wanted to make [as the KLF] something that was... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting me... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88.""
The 12"" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by the KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of the JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental acid house anthems ""What Time Is Love?"" and ""3 a.m. Eternal"", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described the new tracks as ""Pure Trance"". In 1989, the KLF appeared at the Helter Skelter rave in Oxfordshire. ""They wooed the crowd"", wrote Scotland on Sunday some years later, ""by pelting them with... £1,000 worth of Scottish pound notes, each of which bore the message 'Children we love you'"".

Also in 1989, the KLF embarked upon the creation of a road movie and soundtrack album, both titled The White Room, funded by the profits of ""Doctorin' the Tardis"". Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although bootleg copies exist. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the ""pure trance"" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released: ""Kylie Said to Jason"", an electropop record featuring references to Todd Terry, Rolf Harris, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo and BBC comedy programme The Good Life. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn ""Pet Shop Boys infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves.""
The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. ""Kylie Said to Jason"", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could ""rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy"", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top 100. In consequence, The White Room film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single. Meanwhile, ""What Time Is Love?"" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, ""The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs"". This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, ""Last Train to Trancentral"", followed. By this time, Cauty had co-founded the Orb as an ambient side-project with Alex Paterson. Cauty's ambient album Space and the KLF's ""ambient house"" LP Chill Out ambient video Waiting were released in 1990, as was a dance track, ""It's Grim Up North"", under the JAMs' moniker.
Throughout 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed ""stadium house"". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled ""Additional Communicators""), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first ""stadium house"" single, ""What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)"", released in October 1990, reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, ""3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)"", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of ""stadium house"" songs followed by downtempo tracks.The KLF's chart success continued with the single ""Last Train to Trancentral"" hitting number two in the UK, and number three on the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, ""Justified & Ancient"" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit – peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 – as was ""America: What Time Is Love?"", a hard, guitar-laden reworking of ""What Time Is Love?"". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (""Policy of Truth""), the Moody Boys (""What Is Dub?""), and Pet Shop Boys (""So Hard"" from the Behaviour album, and ""It Must Be Obvious""). Neil Tennant described the process: ""When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough.""
The ""stadium house"" singles trilogy was characterised by Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger as applying ""the possibilities for mass lunacy"" to ""awe-inpsiring, colossal, unprecedented dancefloor bulldozers."" He adds: ""For novelty scam-mongers and pranksters, they knew the public well, particularly that strain in British pop listening which likes an occasional brush with the gigantic. The KLF did to house what Jim Steinman did to rock – they turned it into a thing of tottering grand opera absurdity, pushed the excitement in the music to hysteria, traded content for ever-huger gesture. The difference being that the KLF never lost track of what made the music special in the first place. Maybe because there's less inherent 'meaning' in the KLF's music, or maybe just because the 'meaning' in house music is less fragile"".
After successive name changes and dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as the KLF, the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991, still incorporating the work of other artists but in less gratuitous ways and predominantly without legal problems.

BRIT Awards and retirement from the music business
On 12 February 1992, the KLF and grindcore group Extreme Noise Terror performed a live version of ""3 a.m. Eternal"" at the BRIT Awards, the British Phonographic Industry's annual awards show. Drummond and Cauty had planned to throw buckets of blood over the audience, or to disembowel a dead sheep on stage, but were prevented from doing so due to opposition from BBC lawyers and vegetarians Extreme Noise Terror; Sheep were a symbol of the KLF, and Drummond conceded that the ""sheep hacking"" idea was akin to a suicide. Associates reasoned that the plan was to generate such revulsion towards the KLF that they would be ostracised from the music industry and a comeback would be impossible. The dead sheep purchased but the plan thwarted, Drummond considered chopping his hand off with an axe live on stage.
The performance was instead concluded with a limping, kilted, cigar-chomping Drummond firing blanks from an automatic weapon over the heads of the crowd. As the band left the stage, the KLF's promoter and narrator Scott Piering proclaimed over the PA system that ""The KLF have now left the music business"". Later in the evening the band dumped the dead sheep, with the message ""I died for you – bon appetit"" tied around its waist, at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties. Piering's PA announcement was largely not taken seriously at the time; even he and other close associates of the band thought the announcement was a joke. NME's detailed piece on the events at the BRIT Awards and the after-party, which included an interview with Drummond the day after, assured readers that the ""tensions and contradictions"" would continue to ""push and spark"" the KLF and that more ""musical treasure"" would be the result.
In the weeks following the BRITs performance, the KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album The Black Room, but it was never finished. On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the deletion of their back catalogue:

We have been following a wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path these past five years. The last two of which has [sic] led us up onto the commercial high ground – we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what. For the foreseeable future there will be no further record releases from The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The KLF and any other past, present and future name attached to our activities. As of now all our past releases are deleted .... If we meet further along be prepared ... our disguise may be complete.
In a comprehensive examination of the KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it ""the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt."" Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that ""Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity"". Scott Piering said that ""They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines"". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it ""Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant"". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that ""I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&R men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over"". ""For the very last spectacularly insane time"", the magazine concluded, ""The KLF have done what was least expected of them"".
The final KLF Info sheet discussed the retirement in a typically offbeat fashion, and asked ""What happens to 'Footnotes in rock legend'? Do they gather dust with Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, the Vapors, and the Utah Saints, or does their influence live on in unseen ways, permeating future cultures? A passing general of a private army has the answer. 'No', he whispers 'but the dust they gather is of the rarest quality. Each speck a universe awaiting creation, Big Bang just a dawn away'."" There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the ""abyss"". The KLF's BRITs statuette for ""Best British Group"" of 1992 was later found buried in a field near Stonehenge.

K Foundation and other pre-millennium projects
The K Foundation was an arts foundation established by Drummond and Cauty in 1993 following their 'retirement' from the music industry. From 1993 to 1995 they engaged in art projects and media campaigns, including the high-profile K Foundation art award (for the ""worst artist of the year""), and in 1993 released a limited edition single – ""K Cera Cera"" – in Israel and Palestine ""to create awareness of peace in the world"". They burnt what was left of their KLF earnings – a million pounds sterling in cash (equivalent to £2.35m as of 2022) – and filmed the performance. Cauty and Drummond announced a 23-year moratorium on all K Foundation activities in November 1995.

Also in 1995, Drummond and Cauty contributed a song to The Help Album as The One World Orchestra (""featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards""). ""The Magnificent"" is a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven, with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92: ""Humans against killing... that sounds like a junkie against dope"".
On 17 September 1997, Drummond and Cauty re-emerged briefly as 2K. 2K made a one-off performance at London's Barbican Arts Centre with Mark Manning, Acid Brass, the Liverpool Dockers and Gimpo; a performance at which ""Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of Dettol, caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along."" The song performed at the Barbican – ""***k the Millennium"" (a remix of ""What Time Is Love?"" featuring Acid Brass and incorporating elements of the hymn ""Eternal Father, Strong to Save"") – was also released as a single. These activities were accompanied by the usual full page press adverts, this time asking readers ""***k The Millennium: Yes/No?"" with a telephone number provided for voting. At the same time, Drummond and Cauty were also K2 Plant Hire, with plans to build a ""People's Pyramid"" from used house bricks; this plan never reached fruition. K2 Plant Hire Ltd had been registered at Companies House since 1995; Cauty and Drummond are directors. The Directors' Report for the period ending 31 March 1996 listed the company's activities as ""a music company,"" and the accompanying accounts noted a transaction with ""KLF Communications Residual Royalties"", a Cauty-Drummond partnership.

The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu return
On 23 August 2017, in Liverpool, 23 years after they burnt a million pounds, Drummond and Cauty returned as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. The duo launched a novel, 2023: A Trilogy, and staged a three day event, ""Welcome to the Dark Ages"". Ending their self-imposed moratorium, the festival included a debate asking ""Why Did The K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?"" The JAMs also announced new plans for a People's Pyramid to be built from bricks each containing 23 grams of human ashes. New bricks will be laid at the annual ""Toxteth Day Of The Dead"".
Cauty emphasised to the BBC in 2018 that the People's Pyramid project, inspired by his brother's death, is serious: ""It's easy to make it sound like a joke"", he said, ""but it isn't a joke, it's deadly serious and it's a long-term project."" He also confirmed that The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu are a going concern: ""It's interesting to be in a band that doesn't make records but only makes pyramids of dead people.

Samplecity thru Trancentral
On 31 December 2020, the release of series of remastered compilations under the collective title Samplecity thru Trancentral was announced on a graffiti and posters hung under a railway bridge on Kingsland Road in Shoreditch, East London. The 30-minute collection of eight remastered singles Solid State Logik 1 appeared at midnight 1 January 2021, on streaming platforms, while high-definition videos were published for the first time on the band's official YouTube channel, marking the first activity of Cauty and Drummond as the KLF since 1992. On 23 March 2021, the collection was followed by its part 2 featuring 12"" versions of the singles.
On 4 February 2021, a re-edited version of Chill Out was released, retitled Come Down Dawn, with previously unlicensed samples from the original release removed, and added ""What Time Is Love? (Virtual Reality Mix),"" originally from the 1990 remix EP What Time Is Love? (Remodelled & Remixed), integrated in the new mix.
On 23 April 2021, The White Room (Director's Cut) was officially released as the fourth part of the series. The album's edition includes tracks from the unreleased 1989 album, as well as an extended version of ""Last Train to Trancentral"" from the 1991 album.
The documentary Who Killed the KLF?, directed by Chris Atkins, was released on April 4 2022. Atkins began creating the documentary against Drummond's and Cauty's wishes, but was incarcerated in 2016 for tax fraud for two years; he continued editing the film while in prison. According to Atkins, the duo eventually claimed they ""love"" the film, though they pointed out some minor inaccuracies.
The band's master tapes were donated to the British Library in 2023.

KLF Communications
From their very earliest releases as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu until their retirement in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was independently released in their home country (the UK). Their debut releases – the single ""All You Need Is Love"" and the album 1987 – were released under the label name ""The Sound Of Mu(sic)"". By the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to ""KLF Communications"" and, in October 1987, the first of many ""information sheets"" (self written missives from the KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label.
KLF Communications releases were distributed by Rough Trade Distribution (a spinoff of Rough Trade Records) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by the Cartel. As Drummond and Cauty explained, ""The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel."" When Rough Trade Distribution collapsed in 1991 it was reported that they owed KLF Communications £500,000. Plugging (the promotion to TV and radio) was handled by longtime associate Scott Piering.
Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the US, the licensees were Wax Trax (the Chill Out album), TVT (early releases including The History of The JAMs a.k.a. The Timelords), and Arista Records (The White Room and singles). The KLF Communications physical catalogue remains deleted in the United Kingdom.

Themes
Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership, many of these influenced by The Illuminatus! Trilogy; combined, these themes, threads and their activities over the years have been said to form a ""mythology."" Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to Discordianism, popularised by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson in the Illuminatus! books, Situationism, and tactics often interpreted by media commentators as ""Situationist pranks.
In a 2000 review of Drummond's book 45, and an appraisal of the duo's career to date, writer Steven Poole stated that Drummond and Cauty ""are the only true conceptual artists of the [1990s]. And for all the eldritch beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves."" This deep and perplexing mythology, he suggested, results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into their mystique:

A myth like the KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence – don't you see? – is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of the KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole.
Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to Stewart Home and the Neoists. Home himself said that the duo's work ""has much more in common with the Neoist, Plagiarist and Art Strike movements of the nineteen-eighties than with the Situationist avant-garde of the fifties and sixties."" Drummond and Cauty ""represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture"", he added.

Illuminatus!
Drummond was the set designer on Ken Campbell's 1976 stage production of The Illuminatus! Trilogy. In the first KLF Communications Info Sheet, Drummond explained that The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was ""pinched"" from Illuminatus! which he had been reading the year before.
A notable theme of Illuminatus! is the number 23, placed overtly and surreptitiously, both in the book and later throughout the band's career:

In lyrics to the song ""Next"" from the album 1987: ""23 years is a mighty long time"".
They announced they had signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years;
The 1997 return as 2K was ""for 23 minutes only"".
In numbering schemes: for instance, the debut single ""All You Need Is Love"" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23.
In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by the KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on 23 June 1991; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on 23 November 1993; and they burned one million pounds on 23 August 1994.
The 2017 reunion happened at 00:23 on 23 August 23 years after the burning, with the release of a book entitled 2023: A Trilogy. The numerals of the date – 23 August 2017 – also sum to 23 (2+3+0+8+2+0+1+7=23).
When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically ""I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know.""
The ""Pyramid Blaster"" is a logo and icon frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a pyramid, in front of which is suspended a ghetto blaster displaying the word ""Justified"". This references the Eye of Providence icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of Illuminatus! The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 and 2017 reunions, with the proposed building by K2 Plant Hire of a ""People's Pyramid"" (in 1997, a pyramid built with as many bricks as there were births in the 20th century in the UK, and in 2017 a pyramid built from bricks containing the ashes of dead people).

Trancentral
Trancentral (a.k.a. the Benio) was the band's studios. Despite the grandiose lyrics of ""Last Train to Trancentral"", the Trancentral was in fact Cauty's residence in Stockwell, South London (51.471373°N 0.128167°W﻿ / 51.471373; -0.128167﻿ (55 Jeffrey's Road, Stockwell, London)), ""a large and rather grotty squat."" According to Melody Maker's David Stubbs, ""Jimmy has lived [there] for 12 years. There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned... And pinned just above a working top cluttered with chipped mugs is a letter from a five-year-old fan featuring a crayon drawing of the band.""

Sheep
Following the February 1990 release of Chill Out (the press release for which credited sheep as guest vocalists), sheep had recurring roles in the duo's output until their 1992 retirement. Drummond has claimed that the use of sheep on the Chill Out cover was intended to evoke contemporary rural raves and the cover of the Pink Floyd album Atom Heart Mother.

Ceremonies and journeys
Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey. Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings Chill Out, Space, ""Last Train to Trancentral"", ""Justified & Ancient"" and ""America: What Time Is Love?"", as well as the aborted film project The White Room. The Chill Out album depicts a journey across the U.S. Gulf Coast. In his book 45, Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist Richard Long, who incorporates physical journeys into his art.
Fire and sacrifice were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice the KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message. The KLF's short film The Rites of Mu depicts their celebration of the 1991 summer solstice on the Hebridean island of Jura: a 60-foot (18 m) tall wicker man was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a chant; the journalists' money was also burnt.

Promotion
Drummond and Cauty were renowned for their distinctive and humorous public appearances (including several on Top of the Pops), at which they were often costumed. They granted few interviews, communicating instead via semi-regular newsletters, or cryptically phrased full-page adverts in UK national newspapers and the music press. Such adverts were typically stark, comprising large white lettering on black.
From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the guerrilla communication tactic that they described as ""illegal but effective use of graffiti on billboards and public buildings"" in which ""the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted"". Much as the JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' ""SHAG SHAG SHAG"" graffiti, coinciding with their release of ""All You Need Is Love"", was drawn over the ""HALO HALO HALO"" slogan of a Today billboard that depicted Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable James Anderton, who had decried homosexuals amidst the UK media's AIDS furore.
Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a Melody Maker reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a Christmas message from the JAMs. In February 1991, another Melody Maker journalist watched the KLF deface a billboard advertising The Sunday Times, doctoring the slogan ""THE GULF: the coverage, the analysis, the facts"" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge.
In November 1991, the JAMs placed a photograph of graffiti with the slogan ""It's Grim Up North"" – which had appeared on the junction of London's M25 orbital motorway with the M1 that runs to Northern England – as an advert in the NME. The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility, had been the subject of an early day motion in the British House of Commons on 21 October 1991. In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti ""1997: What The Fuck's Going On?"" appeared on the outside wall of London's National Theatre, ten years after the slogan ""1987: What The Fuck's Going On?"" had been similarly placed to mark the release of the JAMs' debut album.

Reputation as ""pranksters""
Cauty and Drummond's tactics have often been labelled by media commentators as ""pranks"" or ""publicity stunts"". In 1991, Drummond told an NME journalist that ""we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct"",  whilst acknowledging that people would likely not believe him. On the morning after the BRITs performance, an impassioned Drummond told the NME that ""I really hate it when people go on about us being 'schemers' and 'scammers'. We do all this stuff from the very depths of our soul and people make out its some sort of game. It depresses me."" Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, ""I think it worked because we really meant it.""

Legacy
Chill Out is cited by AllMusic as ""one of the essential ambient albums"". In 1996, Mixmag named Chill Out the fifth best ""dance"" album of all time, describing Cauty's DJ sets with the Orb's Alex Paterson as ""seminal"". The Guardian has credited the KLF with inventing ""stadium house""; NME named the KLF's stadium house album The White Room the 81st best album of all time whilst Q listed it as the 89th best British album of all time, in 2000.

Opinions of contemporaries
In 1991, Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be the KLF. Neil Tennant added that ""They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said EMF nicked the F from KLF. They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters.""
At the time of the KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague David Balfe said of Drummond's KLF career that ""the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff ... I think the very avoidance of cliché has become their particular cliché"".
In March 1994, members of the anarchist band Chumbawamba expressed their respect for the KLF. Vocalist and percussionist Alice Nutter referred to the KLF as ""real situationists"" categorising them as political musicians alongside the Sex Pistols and Public Enemy. Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding ""I think the things the KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the BRIT Awards.""

Direct influence
The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band Scooter, being sampled on virtually every album Scooter have released.
In the weeks leading up to the 1996 FA Cup Final, a group called ""1300 Drums featuring the Unjustified Ancients of M.U."" released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona.
The Timelords' book, The Manual, was used by the one-hit-wonders Edelweiss to secure their hit ""Bring Me Edelweiss"".
The duo ""The FLK"" released two albums and several singles in the 2010s, appropriating the KLF's aesthetic and musical style and mixing it with samples and references from folk music. Their anonymity, along with details such as their use of a Ford Timelord which was very similar to the original in their videos and promotional material, led some to believe that the FLK actually were the KLF. However, it emerged in 2018 that they were two ex-members of the Leeds-based indie band The Hollow Men.

Career retrospectives
Drummond and Cauty have appeared frequently in British broadsheets and music papers since the KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their burning of one million pounds. The NME called them ""masters of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves"".
In 1992, NME referred to the KLF as ""Britain's greatest pop group"" and ""the two most brilliant minds in pop today"", and in 2002 listed the duo in their ""Top 50 Icons"" at number 48. The British music paper also listed the KLF's 1992 BRIT Awards appearance at number 4 in their ""top 100 rock moments of all time"". ""What's unique about Drummond and Cauty"", the paper said in 1993, ""is the way that, under all the slogans and the sampling and the smart hits and the dead sheep and the costumes, they appear not only to care, but to have some idea of how to achieve what they want.""
""[Of their many aliases,] it is as the KLF that they will go down in pop history,"" wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, ""for a variety of reasons, the most important being the resolute purity of their self-abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop."" He added: ""By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts."" The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of The Face: ""the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it."" Garratt believes their influence on the British house and rap scene cannot be overestimated. ""Their attitude was shaped by the rave scene, but they also love pop music. So many people who make pop actually despise it, and it shows.""
Trouser Press reviewer Ira Robbins referred to the KLF's body of work as ""a series of colorful sonic marketing experiments"". The Face called them ""the kings of cultural anarchy"". Robert Sandall wrote in 1993 that one of the KLF's ""maxims"" was ""making the unthinkable happen"". In 1999, Ewing wrote: ""Even before they put their money where their matches were, the KLF, also known as the Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu, furthermore known as the JAMMS, were the most brilliant pop-artists of the decade. They were witty with the left hand and baffling with the right; they had a sense of timing and event like nobody since Maclaren; they appeared to not give even the merest hint of a fuck; and they made records which were the best shotgun wedding of concept to rhythm this side of Kraftwerk."" 
In 2003, The Observer named the KLF's departure from the music business (and the BRITs performance in which the newspaper says ""their legend was sealed"") the fifth greatest ""publicity stunt"" in the history of popular music. A 2000 piece in The Daily Telegraph called the BRITs performance ""violently antagonistic"" and reported that the ""music-business audience"" was ""stunned""; on the other hand, Piers Morgan writing shortly after the performance called the KLF ""pop's biggest wallies"". A 2004 listener poll by BBC 6 Music saw the KLF/K Foundation placed second in a list of ""rock excesses"", after The Who.
A 2017 piece in The Guardian, pondering the rumoured return of The KLF, noted that ""in the 25 years since their disappearance, nobody else has come up with anything that matches the duo's extraordinary career""; another piece in the same newspaper in the same year, by a different author, called them ""abstruse"" and ""pop's greatest provocateurs"", and their career ""anarchic, anti-commercial and mostly ludicrous"".

Instrumentation
Early releases by the JAMs, including the album 1987, were performed using an Apple II computer with a Greengate DS3 sampler peripheral card, and a Roland TR-808 drum machine. On later releases, the Greengate DS3 and Apple II were replaced with an Akai S900 sampler and Atari ST computers respectively.
The KLF's 1990–1992 singles were mixed by Mark Stent, using a Solid State Logic automated mixing desk, and The White Room album mixed by J. Gordon-Hastings using an analogue desk. The SSL is referenced in the subtitle of the KLF single ""3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)"", and the title of their 2021 digital compilation albums Solid State Logik 1 and Solid State Logik 2.
The house music of Space and the KLF involved much original instrumentation, for which the Oberheim OB-8 analogue synthesiser was prominently used. Drummond played a Gibson ES-330 semi-acoustic guitar on ""America: What Time Is Love?"", and Cauty played electric guitar on ""Justified & Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)"" and ""America: What Time Is Love?"". Graham Lee provided prominent pedal steel contributions to the KLF's Chill Out and ""Build a Fire"". Duy Khiem played clarinet on ""3 a.m. Eternal"" and ""Make It Rain"". The KLF track ""America No More"" features a pipe band. The Roland TB-303 bassline and Roland TR-909 drum machine feature on ""What Time Is Love (Live at Trancentral)"".

The KLF and Illuminatus! – including a list of their references to the number 23"
The Necks,"The Necks are an Australian avant-garde jazz trio formed in 1987 by founding mainstays Chris Abrahams on piano and Hammond organ, Tony Buck on drums, percussion and electric guitar, and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar and double bass. They play improvisational pieces of up to an hour in length that explore the development and demise of repeating musical figures. Their double LP studio album Unfold was named by Rolling Stone as ""one of the top 20 avant albums of 2017.""
In 2020, the Necks were listed at number 49 in Rolling Stone Australia's ""50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time"" issue.

History
The Necks were formed in 1987 in Sydney by Chris Abrahams on piano and Hammond organ, Tony Buck on drums, percussion and electric guitar, and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar and double bass. In 1983 Abrahams (ex-Laughing Clowns) on keyboards and Swanton on bass guitar were founders of the Benders, a jazz group, with Dale Barlow and Jason Morphett on saxophones, and Louis Burdett on drums; which disbanded in 1985.
Abrahams had formed the Sparklers in 1985, a dance pop band, with Bill Bilson on drums (ex-Sunnyboys), Gerard Corben on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders), Ernie Finckh on guitar, Melanie Oxley on lead vocals (ex-Sweet Nothing), and her older brother Peter Oxley on bass guitar (ex-Sunnyboys). Abrahams left in 1987 before that group's first album, Persuasion (October 1988). Buck had been a member of a number of groups: Great White Noise (1983), Women and Children First, Tango Bravo and Pardon Me Boys; prior to forming the Necks. In 1986 Swanton had been a member of Dynamic Hepnotics.
According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the Necks ""issued several albums of abstract, improvised, jazzy mood music."" François Couture of AllMusic described how they ""usually start playing a very basic melodic and rhythmic figure, and then keep going at it for an hour, gradually introducing microscopic changes and variations. Some critics have compared them to Krautrock groups like Can and Faust. Others find similarities in the works of minimalist composers like LaMonte Young, Tony Conrad, even Philip Glass."" The band has been described as ""offending (successfully) against tradition for the past quarter of a century, [doing so] mostly by occupying the spaces between accepted positions and obstinately refusing to obey genre rules"".
The group issued their debut album, Sex on the Spiral Scratch label in 1989. It consists of a single track of the same name, which is just under an hour long. Couture noticed that ""The difference between Sex and the many other CDs they would record afterwards is the purity: The trio's hypnotic repetitive piece relies only on piano, bass, and drums; no electronics, extra keyboards, samples, or lengthy introduction.""
Aside from their work within the group each member has undertaken side projects, recording session work or as a touring band musician. Abrahams formed an ongoing duo with Melanie Oxley (1989–2003), which has released four ""moody, emotive soul/pop albums"" from Welcome to Violet (October 1992) to Blood Oranges (April 2003). All three have worked for Stephen Cummings, both collectively and individually.

Live performance
The Necks performances are always improvised, with the instrumentation of piano, double bass, and drums/percussion (with the occasional exception, e.g., when Chris Abrahams played the Melbourne Town Hall pipe organ instead of piano). Geoff Winston of London Jazz News described how ""Each performance by [the Necks] begins with a blank page which one of the trio will start to fill in to commence the journey, an uninterrupted set of around forty to sixty minutes. There are no rules, no agreements about who will take that lead and about how the discourse will evolve. The only criteria that apply are those of their own impeccably high standards."" Typically a live performance will begin very quietly with one of the musicians playing a simple figure. One by one, the other two will join with their own contributions–all three players independent yet intertwined. As the 'piece' builds through subtle micro-changes, the interaction of their instruments creates layers of harmonics and prismatic washes of sound that lead some to apply the genre label 'trance jazz'.
The Quietus' Kate Hennessy found that ""any Necks' show is a make or break experience. Some find it cathartic, others buckle and ever the twain shall chafe in the washout. The trio's routine is to play two improvised sets using just piano, double bass and drums: one set relatively calm; the other dispensing sound of escalating intensity for a long hour. Jazz by name but not by nature – if jazz denotes songs that spark at intervals into fine displays of musicianship and tricky timing, after which one claps, drinks, and feels pretty good about the world and the talent in it. No, The Necks plunge listeners to the kinds of violent psychological depths few other bands can achieve at all, let alone all acoustically.""

Studio albums
Studio albums by The Necks are also based on improvisations, but the recording process can involve multiple takes and sections which are then edited together into a single composition. Studio recordings often involve extra instrumentation beyond the core piano, bass and drums, including samples, organ (Abrahams), electric guitar (Buck) and appearances by guest musicians.
The Necks have never attempted live performance of studio recordings.  When they were approached to perform their debut album Sex as part of a series of ""classic albums"" concerts Chris Abrahams pointed out ""That's not how we make music. It would make no sense.""

Soundtracks
Their soundtrack for The Boys (1998) was nominated for ARIA Best Soundtrack Album, AFI Best Musical Score and Australian Guild of Screen Composers Award. They have also recorded soundtracks for What's The Deal? (1997) and In the Mind of the Architect (three one-hour ABC-TV documentaries, 2000).

The Orb,"The Orb are an English electronic music group founded in 1988 by Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty. Known for their psychedelic sound, the Orb developed a cult following among clubbers ""coming down"" from drug-induced highs. Their influential 1991 debut album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld pioneered the UK's nascent ambient house movement, while its UK chart-topping follow-up U.F.Orb represented the group's commercial peak.
Beginning as ambient and dub DJs in London, the Orb's early performances were inspired by electronic artists of the 1970s, most notably Brian Eno, Cluster, and Kraftwerk. The Orb have maintained their signature science fiction aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members Kris Weston, Andy Falconer, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton, and Andy Hughes. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer Thomas Fehlmann, and later, with Martin ""Youth"" Glover, bassist of Killing Joke. Paterson's unauthorised use of other artists' works has led to multiple disputes, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones.
During their live shows in the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and other digital media. Featuring colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery, their performances often incited comparisons to Pink Floyd, whose guitarist, David Gilmour, later collaborated with them on the album Metallic Spheres in 2010.
Their seventeenth studio album, Prism, was released on 28 April 2023 by Cooking Vinyl.

History
1988–1990: Paterson & Cauty
Alex Paterson began his music career in the early 1980s as a roadie for the post-punk rock band Killing Joke, for whom his childhood friend Martin ""Youth"" Glover played bass. Having left Killing Joke's employ, in 1986 Paterson became an A&R man. Paterson and Youth shared a flat in Battersea and Jimmy Cauty, Youth's former bandmate from Brilliant, was a regular visitor. Paterson and Cauty began DJing and producing music together under the name the Orb. Their first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, ""Tripping on Sunshine"", released on Youth's compilation album Eternity Project One. The following year, the Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-track EP based on samples from New York City's KISS FM. It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label WAU! Mr. Modo Records, which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as ""really shit drum sounds"", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the chill out room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his ""The Land of Oz"" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer. The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as ""Sueño Latino"". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played dub and other chill-out music, which it described as ambient house for the E generation.

Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Youth, developed a music production style that incorporated ambient music with a diverse array of samples and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music ambient house. The culmination of the group's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The track, then known as ""Loving You"", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"". For its release as a single on the record label Big Life, the Orb changed the title to ""A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld"". Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the British singles charts. Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by Dave Stewart to remix his top-20 single ""Lily Was Here"". The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including Erasure and System 7.

In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure that the group did not become a side-project of Cauty and Bill Drummond's KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came the KLF album Chill Out, on which  Reynolds (1999) and Prendergast (2003) report Paterson appeared in an uncredited role. In a 2011 interview with Magnetic Magazine, Alex Paterson corroborated his involvement and contribution to the Chill Out album and said he had in fact been ""ripped off"" by the KLF and notably Jimmy Cauty, stating: KLF put the Chill Out album out, which was basically a bunch of my DJ sessions at Trancentral which I never got credited for. That was one of the major reasons why Jimi and I split up. It was becoming apparent to me that everything he said he had given me, he never gave me. That shaped quite a lot of things in my head. Never to be ripped off again, I suppose. Don’t worry, I got ripped off again. But as Jimi said to me, you're never really famous until you've been ripped off.
Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track ""Little Fluffy Clouds"". The group incorporated samples from Steve Reich's Electric Counterpoint. The signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter Rickie Lee Jones, her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional CD released by Geffen Records for her 1989 album, Flying Cowboys. In it she muses on the picturesque images of clouds from her Arizona childhood.

1991–1994: Paterson & Weston
In 1991, Paterson invited freelance studio engineer Andy Falconer to join the Orb. He was closely followed by studio engineer Kris ""Thrash"" Weston. Steve Hillage, who Paterson had met while DJing in London, also joined as a guitarist. Along with producer Thomas Fehlmann, the Orb completed several additional tracks for their first album, The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during the three weeks of recording. Falconer's and Weston's technical abilities and Hillage's guitar work allowed the group to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, including the launch of Apollo 11. Adventures sold well in the United Kingdom and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling. Retrospectively, Adventures is considered ground-breaking for changing the way musicians view sampling and as a vital work for the genres of ambient and dance music. The completion of Adventures saw the departure of Andy Falconer, whose last contribution was to one of the Orb's Peel sessions. To promote the release of an edited single-disc version for an American release on Mercury Records, the Orb embarked on their first tour of the United States beginning in Phoenix, Arizona, in October 1991.
In late 1991 and early 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, ""Blue Room"". Assisting with the recording was bassist Jah Wobble, keyboardist Miquette Giraudy, and guitarist Hillage. Despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes, ""Blue Room"" entered the British charts at No. 12 and peaked at No. 8, making it the longest track to reach the charts. The Orb promoted this single with a ""legendary avant-garde"" performance on Top of the Pops where Patterson and Weston played a game of chess in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of ""Blue Room"" ran in the background. In July 1992, U.F.Orb was released featuring ""Blue Room"" and, in the US release, the Orb's next single, ""Assassin"". Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's Eno-influenced ambience on U.F.Orb, combining ""drum and bass rhythms"" with ""velvet keyboards"" and ""rippling synth lines"". U.F.Orb reached No. 1 on the British album charts to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock. Despite the Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music to be the focus of attention. Because of this partial anonymity and the Orb's rotating membership, they are often recognised as more of a musical collective than a ""band"".
Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce ""new"" material, and the Orb left Big Life to sign a deal with Island Records. Their first release on Island Records was the live album Live 93, which gathered highlights from their recent performances in Europe and Asia. It featured the live crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and Simon Phillips, as well as audio engineer Andy Hughes, who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring. The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was Pomme Fritz, a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies. Though Pomme Fritz reached No. 6 on the British charts, critics panned it as ""doodling"". Island Records ""hated it"" and ""didn't understand it at all"", according to Paterson. Soon after production finished on Pomme Fritz, Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with Robert Fripp to form the group FFWD as a side project. FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's Inter-Modo label, which Fehlmann later described as ""an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!"". Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release. Also in the summer of 1994 the Orb provided music for The Jupiter Collision, the BBC's brief info series about the Shoemaker-Levy comet. Soon after the release of FFWD in August 1994, Weston suddenly left the Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to his desire to have more control in the Orb. In an interview with i-D, Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson ""didn't do his 50 per cent of the work"". Paterson reaffirmed the status of the Orb saying, ""The Orb is the Orb, and nothing can change that"", and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.

1995–2001: Paterson, Fehlmann & Hughes
Following Weston's departure from the Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, but did not always participate in live performances. Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album Orbus Terrarum, on which Paterson and Weston had been working. Orbus Terrarum, released in 1995, featured more ""earthbound"" and ""organic"" sounds than their previous trippy science-fiction-themed music. Orbus Terrarum suffered, as Paterson described it, ""a good kicking"" at the hands of the British press, who described it as ""generic"" and a low point for Paterson's creativity. Orbus Terrarum alienated many of the group's fans, and reached only No. 20 on the British charts. American critics gave it great acclaim, including Rolling Stone who made it their album of the month, citing its symphonic flow coupled with the Orb's ""uniquely British wit"". After a long world tour, the Orb, with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, settled down to produce their next album, Orblivion—the process of which saw a return to their spacey sounds. Though Orblivion was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow-up to U2's techno-rock album Pop. Orblivion sold well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the Billboard Top 200. The first Orblivion single, ""Toxygene"", was the highest-charting single by the Orb, reaching No. 4 in the United Kingdom on 8 February 1997. Despite high sales, Orblivion received a lukewarm reception from the British press. As with Orbus Terrarum, Orblivion was better received by American critics, including Rolling Stone, who praised its ""contrast of chaos and euphony"". Meanwhile, the stresses of touring sat heavily on Paterson; he considered retiring the Orb, but continued touring and producing. In 1997 the band sold their studio Joe's Garage to the Godfrey brothers of Morcheeba. That same year, they contributed a cover of ""Jo the Waiter"" to the Gary Numan tribute album Random.
Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Nick Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced Cydonia for a planned 1999 release. Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, John Roome (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of the Orb's live performers. Singers Nina Walsh and Aki Omori appeared on two tracks each, providing vocals and co-writing lyrics with Paterson. Paterson felt that this new direction of songwriting for the Orb was more similar to the experimental work of Orbus Terrarum than to the techno-pop of Orblivion. Island Records was in a period of restructuring due to its recent purchase by Universal Music Group, and Cydonia was not released until 2001. Upon release, critics noted that Cydonia merged pop, trance, and ambient-dub music, which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked the appeal of the Orb's earlier work. NME harshly described it as ""a stillborn relic, flawed throughout by chronically stunted ambitions"" and describing its only appropriate audience to be ""old ravers"" seeking nostalgia. The Orb were generally regarded by the British press as past their prime and an ""ambient dinosaur"" out of place in the current dance music environment. After the release of Cydonia, Hughes left the group for undisclosed reasons, becoming ""another acrimonious departure from the Orb"" according to The Guardian.

2001–2004: Paterson, Fehlmann & Phillips
In 2001, Alex Paterson formed the record label Badorb.com as an outlet for Orb members' side projects. To promote both Badorb.com and Cydonia, the Orb toured internationally, including their first visit to the United States in four years. NME described the Orb's tour as ""charming"" and that they were ""freed from the Floydian pretensions that dogged the band throughout the mid-'90s"".
The Orb, now composed of Paterson, Phillips, and Fehlmann, with guest John Roome, accepted an invitation to join the Area:One concert tour with Moby, Paul Oakenfold, New Order and other alternative and electronic artists. Though the Orb were paired with more mainstream artists during the tour such as Incubus, Paterson and Fehlmann made their next releases a series of several low-key EPs for German label Kompakt in 2002. The Orb found critical success on Kompakt; but Badorb.com collapsed soon after releasing the compilation Bless You. Badorb.com had released fourteen records over the course of fourteen months from artists including Guy Pratt (Conduit), Ayumi Hamasaki, and Takayuki Shiraishi, as well as the Orb's three-track Daleth of Elphame EP. Though Badorb.com was an internet-based record label, they sold only vinyl releases (with one exception, the Orb EP), which Paterson later remarked was a poor idea because ""not many people ... have record players"".

Though their musical style had changed somewhat since the 1990s, the Orb continued to use their odd synthetic sounds on 2004's Bicycles & Tricycles, to mixed reviews. The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being ""inclusive, exploratory, and an enjoyable journey""; other publications dismissed it as ""stoner dub"" and irrelevant to current electronic music. Like Cydonia, Bicycles & Tricycles featured vocals, including rapper MC Soom-T who added a hip hop contribution to the album. The Orb left Island Records and released the album on Cooking Vinyl and Sanctuary Records. To promote the album, the band began a UK tour with dub artist Mad Professor. Though the Orb still pulled in large crowds, The Guardian noted that they lacked the intensity found in their earlier performances.

2004–2007: Paterson & Fehlmann, the Transit Kings
After two more EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now composed of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material in addition to tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, AllMusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, ""inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses"". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less ""goofy"" than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it ""difficult to say where [Paterson] is in the picture"". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could ""age gracefully"".
In August 2006, the founders of the Orb—Paterson and Cauty—released Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God, their debut album as the Transit Kings with Guy Pratt and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as ""self-consciously musically written and less sample-based"" compared to the members' previous work. Living had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions; The Times called it ""Orb-lite"" and proclaimed it to be ""Deep Forest-style sludge"". After the album's release, Cauty left the Transit Kings on ""extended leave"", leaving the project in indefinite limbo, and Beken joined the Orb for a period. Paterson and Beken reunited in 2008 as High Frequency Bandwidth, an ambient hip hop group on the Malicious Damage label.

2007–present
The Orb's next studio album, The Dream, was released in Japan in 2007 and the following year in the United States and United Kingdom. Fehlmann is absent on The Dream and Paterson was instead reunited with Youth and joined by Tim Bran of Dreadzone. The album saw a return to the Orb's sounds of the early 1990s, with peculiar vocals and playful samples. The Orb also brought in jazz and house music singer Juliet Roberts and guitarist Steve Hillage.
After the July 2006 re-release of The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld 3-CD Deluxe Edition, 2007 and 2008 saw releases of expanded 2-CD editions of the band's subsequent regular studio records: U.F.Orb, Pomme Fritz EP, Orbus Terrarum, Orblivion and Cydonia. In late 2008 a double-cd compilation of BBC Radio 1 sessions called The Orb: Complete BBC Sessions 1989–2001 was released.
In May 2009, the British Malicious Damage Records (run by the members of Killing Joke) announced the release of the Orb's ninth regular studio album Baghdad Batteries (Orbsessions Volume III) on 11 September 2009. A reunification of Paterson and long-term collaborator Thomas Fehlmann who last worked together on Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt, the album was promoted with a launch party with Paterson and Fehlmann performing the whole album live at The-Situation Modern in Clapham, England on 10 September. A track ""Chocolate Fingers"" was uploaded onto the label's MySpace profile. Unlike the first 2 albums in the Orbsessions series, which consisted of archive recordings, Baghdad Batteries comprised brand new material recorded at Fehlmann's Berlin studio.
In March 2010, Internet station Dandelion Radio broadcast a seventeen and a half-minute long Orb session track by Paterson and Fehlmann on the Andrew Morrison show. This new track was titled ""Battersea Bunches"" and was a remixed version of the soundtrack to a short movie of the same title by Mike Coles and Alex Paterson—a film installation to be seen at London's Battersea Power Station on 1 June 2010 as part of an evening of art and music. The film and its soundtrack (together with remixes) were later released as the CD/DVD album C Batter C on 11 November 2011.
In mid-2010, Alex Paterson teamed up with Youth to compile a retrospective compilation album of tracks from the WAU! Mr Modo label. The album titled Impossible Oddities was released on CD and double Vinyl on 25 October 2010 via Year Zero records.
The Orb released the Metallic Spheres album in October 2010, featuring David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. It was released by Columbia Records.
In 2011, Alex Paterson teamed up with producer Gaudi and vocalist Chester Taylor for the creation of their experimental and ongoing collaborative project SCREEN, releasing the album We are Screen by Malicious Damage Records.
In 2012, the Orb worked with dub musician Lee ""Scratch"" Perry to produce a reggae-infused album titled The Orbserver in the Star House, which was recorded in Berlin over a period of several months and features the single ""Golden Clouds"". The title song was based on an earlier version of Little Fluffy Clouds, with the lyrics rewritten by Perry reflecting his childhood in Jamaica and the property Golden Clouds near his home.
In 2013, the Orb performed with the Kakatsisi drummers of Ghana on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury Festival.
On 22 June 2018, the Orb released their fifteenth studio album, No Sounds Are Out of Bounds.
During 2019, the Orb have been touring with a 30th anniversary tour, performed by Alex Paterson and London based producer/sound engineer Michael Rendall.
The Orb released their sixteenth studio album, Abolition of the Royal Familia, on 27 March 2020. It includes contributions from Youth, Roger Eno, Gaudi, David Harrow and Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy (System 7).
On 28 April 2023, The Orb released their seventeenth album, Prism, on the Cooking Vinyl label.
The Orb collaborated with Chocolate Hills to produce the latter's second album, Yarns From The Cholocate Triangle, released 16 June 2023.

Themes and influences
Inspiration
The Orb's members have drawn from an assortment of influences in their music. The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences that included King Tubby, Alice Cooper, Prince, Kraftwerk, and T.Rex. Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built. While in Brixton with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as The Mighty Diamonds, The Abyssinians, and Bob Marley. The reggae influence on Paterson and the Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single ""Perpetual Dawn"" and U.F.Orb's ""Towers of Dub"". The earliest ambient influences of the Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke. While with the band in Neuss, Paterson listened to Brian Eno's Music for Films while on LSD and watched ""the Ruhr steel works explode in the distance"", noting that ""[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well"". The same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to Cluster's Grosses Wasser and found that the steel works' ""huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music"", which was something he'd ""never seen, or heard, anything like it before"". Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from Can and composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Modulations calls Paterson's music a ""maximal"" version of Brian Eno's ""minimal"" ambience, though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.
The Orb have often been described as ""The Pink Floyd of the Nineties"", but Paterson has stated that their music is more influenced by experimental electronic music than progressive rock of the 1970s. He has noted though that the Pink Floyd album Meddle was influential to him as a child in the 1970s. The psychedelic prog-rock similarities have led critics to describe the Orb as hippie revivalists; Paterson has strongly rejected the tag, claiming that even as a youth, he was ""one of those punks who hated hippies"".
During production of Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles, Paterson's biggest influences were drum and bass and trip hop music, as seen on the tracks ""Ghostdancing"", ""Thursday's Keeper"", and ""Aftermath"". The Orb's more recent influences consist largely of German techno producers, such as Triola, who were inspired by the Orb's earlier work. Paterson cites the music of Kompakt as one of his primary modern influences and claims it to be among the best modern ambient music.

Imagery
Imagery has always been an important part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.
The Orb's album art features much of the same imagery as their live act. Graphic design group The Designers Republic created the cover art for the earlier work, including Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, U.F.Orb, and the singles from those two albums. For their next album, the Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of Live 93 featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the Battersea Power Station, which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's Animals. The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to the Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.

Science fiction and space
Some of the more prominent motifs in the Orb's work are outer space and science fiction, including alien visitations, space flight, and mind control. These have included the use of samples from serious sources such as NASA transmissions to comedic clips from films like Woody Allen's Sleeper. U.F.Orb especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself. The title of its most popular single, ""Blue Room"", is a reference to the supposed Blue Room of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which was investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room. Their 2001 album is named after the Cydonia Mensae region of Mars. Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, The Guardian described Paterson as ""pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens"".

Techniques, technology, live performances
In the Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an Akai 12-track mixer. They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an ""endless sound continuum"" for audiences of worn-out dancers. Even after the Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and U.F.Orb, they performed using a digital audio tape machine and experimented with other media sources such as dubplates. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJing. Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect racks. Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.
The Orb began performing regularly at the Brixton Academy in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their ""well-suited amorphous sound"", frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there. Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for the Orb's concert at the rainy Woodstock '94. The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including Aphex Twin, Orbital, and Deee-Lite. The next year, the Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on drums, and Simon Phillips on bass. This live setup created a ""cacophony"" of ""gigantic, swarming sounds"". Though the Orb's performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present them as ""a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage"".
The Orb used ADAT recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as being a ""studio onstage"". They hooked synthesisers, such as the ARP 2600, to MIDI interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums. The Orb's methods of studio music creation changed as well. For more recent albums such as Cydonia, they used inexpensive equipment such as Korg's Electribe products, which Paterson described as employing more of a ""bedroom techno"" approach. Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.

Sampling and remixing
One of the Orb's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing. Albums such as Pomme Fritz, though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single ""Toxygene"". ""Toxygene"" was originally commissioned as a remix of Jean Michel Jarre's ""Oxygene 8"" from Oxygene 7-13. The Orb ""obliterated it"" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it; The Orb released the track themselves under the name ""Toxygene"", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted ""The French are always five years behind us, anyway."" In statements made after the release of ""Toxygene"", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.
Other artists have become agitated due to the Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that ""[t]hey don't know the half of it."" Paterson says that he finds a ""beauty"" and a ""cleverness"" with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it. Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of the samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would ""die"" if they discovered, for example, where the drums on ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" originated from. He has said that record labels have cautioned him, ""Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!"".

The Orb have used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from McCarthy era speeches to prank phone calls by Victor Lewis-Smith to David Thewlis' apocalypse-driven rant from the film Naked. Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favourite clips. He and other members of the Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, especially FFWD and Orbus Terrarum. The Orb's combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a ""fuzzy texture"" in the sound quality, depersonalising the Orb's music. The Orb are lauded for their ""Monty Python-esque levity"" in their use of audio samples, though NME asserts that Paterson ""sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes"" with ""irritatingly zany"" sounds.
The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989. Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, the Orb found steady work remixing for artists including Depeche Mode, Lisa Stansfield, and Front 242. The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature a large number of comical samples, Progressive-Sounds describe them as ""ahead of their time"" and NME notes them as ""not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling"". Some pieces, such as their Bee Gees cover collaboration with Robbie Williams, received criticism for being ""beyond a joke"" for their use of strange noises. The Orb's remix of Nine Inch Nails' ""The Perfect Drug"", too, was described as ""silly"", as they made it sound like Trent Reznor was ""drowning in his bathtub"". Though Paterson maintains that much of the Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so they could ""pay the bills"".

Thomas Newman,"Thomas Montgomery Newman (born October 20, 1955) is an American composer and conductor best known for his many film scores. In a career that has spanned over four decades, he has scored numerous films including The Player (1992), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), The Horse Whisperer (1998), American Beauty and The Green Mile (both 1999), Pay It Forward (2000), In the Bedroom (2001), Road to Perdition and White Oleander (both 2002), Finding Nemo (2003) and its sequel Finding Dory (2016), Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), Cinderella Man (2005), WALL-E (2008), the James Bond films Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015), Bridge of Spies (2015), 1917 (2019), and Elemental (2023). He also composed the music for the HBO drama series Six Feet Under (2001) and 2003 miniseries Angels in America. Throughout his career, he has collaborated extensively with directors such as Sam Mendes, Andrew Stanton, Frank Darabont, Steven Soderbergh, Jon Avnet, John Madden and John Lee Hancock.

Personal life
Born in Los Angeles, California, Newman is the youngest son of composer Alfred Newman (1900–1970), who won the Academy Award for Best Original Score nine times, and Martha Louis Montgomery (1920–2005). He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in Hollywood that includes his father Alfred, older brother David Newman, younger sister Maria Newman, uncles Lionel Newman and Emil Newman, cousin Randy Newman (also known as a singer and songwriter), and his first cousin, once removed, Joey Newman. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his mother was from Mississippi.
During their upbringing, Martha Newman took her sons to violin lessons in the San Fernando Valley every weekend. Newman later studied composition and orchestration for two years at the University of Southern California, before transferring to Yale University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1977 and a Master of Music in 1978. While at Yale, he met composer Stephen Sondheim, who became an early mentor.
Newman and his wife Ann Marie have three children. They reside in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Career
1983–1992
At first, Newman was more interested in musical theater than in film composition, working with Sondheim in Broadway plays. Lionel, who succeeded Alfred as music director for 20th Century Fox, gave Thomas his first scoring assignment on a 1979 episode of the series The Paper Chase. In 1983, John Williams, who was a friend of both Alfred and Lionel, invited Newman to work on Return of the Jedi, orchestrating the scene in which Darth Vader dies. Afterward Newman met producer Scott Rudin in New York City and Rudin invited him to compose the score for Reckless (1984). Newman said that he thought ""it was a tough job, at first"" for requiring him to ""develop vocabularies and a sense of procedure"", only getting comfortable with writing scores ""and not fraudulent in my efforts"" after eight years. In 1992, Newman composed the scores for The Player and Scent of a Woman.

1994–1999
In 1994, he received his first Academy Award nominations with the scores for The Shawshank Redemption and Little Women. He also scored The War. In 1996, he scored Unstrung Heroes, receiving yet another Oscar nomination. In 1998, he scored  The Horse Whisperer as well as Meet Joe Black. In 1999, Newman composed the score to American Beauty, created using mainly percussion instruments; this was the first of several collaborations with director Sam Mendes. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the ""moral ambiguity"" of the script, saying ""It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that."". He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to John Corigliano for The Red Violin), he did receive a Grammy and a BAFTA.

2000–2011
His critical and commercial success continued in the years to follow, which included scores for films directed by celebrated independent filmmakers such as Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich), and Todd Field (In the Bedroom). He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for Road to Perdition (2002; his second collaboration with Sam Mendes), Finding Nemo (2003), and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). However, he lost on each occasion, to Elliot Goldenthal (for Frida), Howard Shore (for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), and Jan A. P. Kaczmarek (for Finding Neverland).
In 2006, he teamed once again with Todd Field for Little Children and Steven Soderbergh for The Good German (and was nominated for latter). At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by Errol Morris, who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times. Newman replied: ""No, I've failed seven but this will be my eighth"", and indeed, he again lost, this time to Gustavo Santaolalla for Babel.
His first score since The Good German was for Towelhead. In 2008, he scored the animated film WALL-E, collaborating for the second time with director Andrew Stanton (with the first collaboration being Finding Nemo). The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had Nemo). Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for ""Down to Earth"", which he co-wrote with Peter Gabriel. He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, James Newton Howard and Danny Elfman, both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully. Newman lost both the score and song nominations to A. R. Rahman for his work on Slumdog Millionaire. He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for ""Down to Earth"".
In 2008, he also scored Revolutionary Road, a further collaboration with Mendes. In 2009, he scored Brothers (the remake of the Susanne Bier film). In 2011, he scored The Help, The Debt, The Iron Lady, and The Adjustment Bureau.

2012–present
In 2012, Newman scored The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, a second collaboration with John Madden after The Debt. He also scored the 23rd James Bond movie Skyfall, released on the film franchise's 50th anniversary. His work on this film earned him his eleventh Oscar nomination and a second BAFTA win. During 2013, he scored Side Effects (working again with director Steven Soderbergh) and Saving Mr. Banks. The latter score was very well received by film music critics, earning Newman BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the second consecutive year, both of which he lost to Steven Price for Gravity.
Newman's 2014 projects included The Judge and Get on Up. In 2015, he scored The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, marking the first time Newman has scored a sequel to a film he also wrote the score for. Also that year, Newman returned to score the 24th James Bond movie Spectre, the sequel to Skyfall and a continuation of his longtime collaboration with Sam Mendes. He also worked with Steven Spielberg for Bridge of Spies, marking Newman's first collaboration with Spielberg and the first Spielberg film not to feature a musical score from his long-time composer John Williams, since the production of The Color Purple in 1985. For his score on Bridge of Spies, Newman garnered additional Oscar and Grammy nominations.
In 2016, Newman scored Passengers, for which he received his 14th Oscar nomination. Three years later, Newman reunited with Sam Mendes for his war film 1917, for which Newman received his 6th BAFTA and 15th Oscar nominations.
Newman likes to vary the instrumentation in his scores, ranging from full orchestra to percussion-only music. He is also fond of incorporating unusual instruments such as the zither, hurdy-gurdy, psaltery and hammered dulcimer, or unexpected sounds, like Aboriginal chants and the chirping of cicadas. The composer declared that he has ""an interest in mundane experimentation.""

Filmography
Awards and nominations
Newman has been nominated for fifteen Academy Awards, tying him with fellow composer Alex North for the most nominations without a win. He has also been nominated for four Golden Globes, and has won two BAFTAs, six Grammys and an Emmy Award. Newman was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2000 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music. His achievements have contributed to the Newmans being the most nominated Academy Award extended family, with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.

Tim Hecker,"Tim Hecker is a Canadian electronic musician, producer, composer, and sound artist. His work, spanning albums such as Harmony in Ultraviolet (2006), Ravedeath, 1972 (2011) and Virgins (2013), has been widely critically acclaimed. He has released eleven albums and a number of EPs in addition to a number of film scores and collaborations with artists such as Arca, Ben Frost, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Daniel Lopatin, and Aidan Baker.

Biography
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hecker is the son of two art teachers. During his high school years, he played in rock bands with friends, before acquiring a sampler and working on solo material. He moved to Montreal, Quebec in 1998 to study at Concordia University and explore his artistic interests further. He initially performed internationally as a DJ and techno producer under the name Jetone, releasing three albums under the moniker. By 2001 he became disenchanted with the musical direction of the Jetone project. In 2001, Hecker released the album Haunt Me, Haunt Me Do It Again, under his own name through the label Alien8. He followed with Radio Amor (2003) and Mirages (2004).
In 2006 he moved to Kranky where he released his fourth album Harmony in Ultraviolet. He subsequently incorporated the use of pipe organ sounds which were digitally processed and distorted. The album was called the 9th best ambient album of all time by Pitchfork. For the album Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker traveled to Iceland where together with Ben Frost, he recorded parts in a church. Ravedeath, 1972 was awarded the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. In November 2010, Alien8 re-released Hecker's debut album on vinyl. Live performances contain improvisations by processing organ sounds that are manipulated, with great fluctuations in volume.
In 2012, Hecker collaborated with Daniel Lopatin (who also records as Oneohtrix Point Never) on an improvisatory project which became Instrumental Tourist (2012). Following 2013's Virgins, Hecker returned to Reykjavík, Iceland for sessions in 2014 and 2015, to create what would become Love Streams. Collaborators include Ben Frost, Johann Johannsson, Kara-Lis Coverdale and Grimur Helgason, whilst the 15th century choral works by Josquin des Prez birthed the foundations of the album. In February 2016, it was announced that Hecker had joined 4AD while Love Streams (2016) was released in April of that year. Hecker admits to thinking about ideas like ""liturgical aesthetics after Yeezus"" and the ""transcendental voice in the age of auto-tune"" during its creation.
In addition to touring with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur Rós and recording with the likes of Fly Pan Am, Hecker has also collaborated with the likes of Arca and Aidan Baker. He has also contributed remixes to other artists, including Ellen Allien, John Cale, Isis, and Interpol.

Personal life
Hecker pursued a professional career outside music and worked as a policy analyst for the Canadian Government in the early 2000s. After leaving his employment in 2006 he enrolled at McGill University to study for a PhD, with a thesis on urban noise that was published in 2014. He has also worked there as a lecturer in sound culture in the Art History and Communications department.

Ulrich Schnauss,"Ulrich Schnauss (born 1977) is a German electronic musician and producer based in London, England. He was a member of Tangerine Dream from 2014 to 2020.

Biography
Ulrich Schnauss was born in the northern German seaport of Kiel in 1977.  He had piano lessons when he was seven. He became interested in a range of music: My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Tangerine Dream, Chapterhouse, and early bleep and breakbeat tracks. There was not much opportunity to see his musical influences in Kiel, so he moved to Berlin in 1996.
Schnauss' musical output began under the pseudonyms of View to the Future and Ethereal 77. These electronica and drum-driven pieces were noticed by Berlin electronica label CCO (City Centre Offices), to which Schnauss sent CDs on a regular basis. Schnauss developed these submissions to CCO into his first album under his own name, Far Away Trains Passing By, released in Europe in 2001 and in the United States in 2005.

His next album, 2003's A Strangely Isolated Place, showed the influence of My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields and Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie. Schnauss has said of this album, ""When you've worked with computers and keyboards for a number of years, they become not so fascinating of themselves anymore. I gained confidence after people began to discover Far Away Trains Passing By, and it hasn't really stopped since then. This time I decided not to compromise on what I wanted to do, with what I thought people might want me to do.""
Since the release of both albums Schnauss has been asked to work with and remix with artists, including port-royal, Mojave 3, Airiel, A Shoreline Dream, Asobi Seksu, Televise, Longview, Johannes Schmoelling, The Zephyrs, Lunz (Roedelius), and others.
He also plays keyboards for UK indie band Longview, whose singer Rob McVey was featured on Schnauss' next album, Goodbye. In an interview, he said: ""I have always loved music that has both elements: melancholy and sadness as a description of the current situation you are in, but at the same time a hopeful, utopian element that reminds you of the possibility of a different life.""
His third album, Goodbye, was completed in early 2007. It was released in Europe by Independiente Records on 25 June 2007. The United States release followed on 10 July under Domino Records. Regarding this album, he said: ""The overall idea was pretty much the same. I just wanted to merge the indie songwriting elements and electronic instrumentation. After the previous album I still had a feeling like there was more room to take these ideas to an extreme level when it comes to layering and laying down as many tracks as possible.""
On 12 June 2007, Schnauss released an EP, Quicksand Memory, which contains two remixes by Robin Guthrie of previous releases, a mix by Rob McVey of a previously unreleased track, and an edit of a track appearing on his latest album.
In the spring of 2008, Schnauss remixed two tracks by the Manchester-based shoegaze band Daniel Land and the Modern Painters. On 27 October 2008, the two tracks, ""Within the Boundaries"" and ""Benjamin's Room"", were released as a double A-side 7"" single by the independent record label Sonic Cathedral, the label's 11th release.
In July 2008, the Stars EP was released to support his June/July US tour. A co-produced/co-written track with A Shoreline Dream, titled ""neverChanger"", was released on an EP of the same name. Schnauss traveled out for a short tour with the band in Texas and Colorado to promote this effort and performed this track with A Shoreline Dream during his performances.
In October 2009, Schnauss' record labels, Independiente and Domino, sued Guns N' Roses, alleging that the band had committed copyright infringement by using portions of Schnauss' compositions in the track ""Riad 'n the Bedouins"" on the album Chinese Democracy.
In 2010, Schnauss was involved in the mixing of Exit Calm's self-titled debut album.
Schnauss also provided keyboards and backing vocals on Engineers' third album, In Praise of More. Schnauss also played as a headlining act for the ""Phrase One"" festival held in the small Irish town of Carrick-on-Shannon on 19 April 2013.
Schnauss was a member of Tangerine Dream from 2014 to 2020. His first release with the group was the mini-album Mala Kunia (2014) which launched ""The Quantum Years""-era of the group influenced by quantum physics.
After obtaining the rights to his entire catalog, Schnauss remastered and mixed all five of his solo studio albums, releasing them in 2019 on the 7CD compilation box set Now is a Timeless Present, along with a bonus disc of unreleased recordings and outtakes. Albums A Long Way to Fall and No Further Ahead than Today were also re-worked and partially re-recorded, and given new artwork and titles of A Long Way to Fall – Rebound and No Further Ahead than Tomorrow. Each remastered album was later released individually in 2020.

Ulrich Schnauss Says Auf Wiedersehen (23 July 2007)"
Ulver,"Ulver (Norwegian for ""wolves"") is a Norwegian experimental electronica band founded in 1993, by vocalist Kristoffer Rygg. Their early works, such as debut album Bergtatt, were categorised as folklore-influenced black metal, but the band has since evolved a fluid and increasingly eclectic musical style, blending genres such as experimental rock, electronica, ambient, trip hop, symphonic and chamber traditions, noise, progressive and experimental music into their oeuvre. 1997 marked their international debut with the release of their third album Nattens madrigal through German label Century Media. However, following discord with the label, Rygg formed his own imprint, Jester Records, in 1998.
In 1997, Rygg invited composer and multi-instrumentalist Tore Ylwizaker into the band, and together they changed Ulver's musical direction. Their first musical endeavour together, Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, drew from a variety of non-metal sources, including classical and avant-garde, and the works of William Blake. Metamorphosis (1999) and Perdition City (2000) followed, showcasing further experimentation and explorations into electronic music. In 2000, author Jørn H. Sværen joined the band, and since then, the core of Ulver has been Rygg, Ylwizaker and Sværen. In 2009, Ulver expanded their line-up: British multi-instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan became the fourth core member, and several other musicians were enlisted as supporting and live members; of the latter, Norwegian musician and producer Ole Alexander Halstensgård has since established himself as another prominent member of the band.
Ulver has performed at several prestigious venues, including Queen Elizabeth Hall (2009), the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet (2010), Teatro Regio di Parma (2013), Labirinto della Masone di Franco Maria Ricci (2017) and held artist residency at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter (2018).
The band have sold in excess of half a million records, been three nominated for the Norwegian Grammy Awards, Spellemannsprisen, in different categories, won Album of the Year at the Oslo Awards for Shadows of the Sun in 2008, won the NATT&DAG award for Best Live Act in 2011, and earned a global reputation for stylistic unpredictability.
Author and musician Julian Cope has said, ""Ulver are cataloguing the death of our culture two decades before anyone else has noticed its inevitable demise.""

History
The Black Metal Trilogie (1993–1997)
The band was founded in 1993 in Oslo by vocalist Kristoffer Rygg together with Grellmund, Robin Malmberg, Carl-Michael Eide, Håvard Jørgensen, and A. Reza. Ulver issued their first demo cassette, Vargnatt, in November 1993. Their music and style was consistent with the Norwegian black metal subculture of the early 1990s. However some have noted the avant-garde, jazz, rock and gothic influences that would later shape the band's sound. The archaic Dano-Norwegian lyrics were greatly influenced by Scandinavian folktales and inspired by Baroque poets such as Ludvig Holberg and the hymn-writer Thomas Kingo.
Their debut album, Bergtatt, the first part of what has become known as Ulver's ""Black Metal Trilogie,"" was issued in February 1995 through Norwegian label Head Not Found. The album was met with critical acclaim, and was notable for blending black metal, harsh vocals and blurred, buzzing guitars with quiet, folk-like acoustic passages. It was praised for its unique atmosphere and was described as ""mysterious, melancholic, eerie, and oddly tranquil.""
Prior to their second album, founding member Grellmund committed suicide on New Year’s Day 1996 at the age of 19. Kveldssanger, issued March 1996 by Head Not Found, Ulver eschewed a typical black metal sound by incorporating classical guitars, cello and choral chamber chants overlaid with subtle orchestral landscapes. The album was a drastic contrast to Bergtatt, whilst still retaining the atmospheric and folk themes. Rygg has since remarked that Kveldssanger, despite strong content, was an ""immature attempt at making a classical album"". The album was praised for its atmosphere, evoking a feeling of quiet, eerie solitude.
Following the success of their first two albums, Ulver signed with German label Century Media for their third album Nattens madrigal, issued in March 1997, marking the band's international debut. The album showcases a black metal style similar to Bergtatt, abandoning the acoustic and atmospheric elements of Kveldssanger, with an intentionally underproduced sound. The album has been described as ""raw and grim black metal at its blackest."" A common myth about the album is that the band spent the recording budget on Armani suits, cocaine and a Corvette; and recorded the album outdoors in a Norwegian forest on an 8-track recorder. Rygg, however, has stated that this is not true, and possibly a rumour started by Century Media. The album has been described as ""so fast and ferocious and the vocals so garbled that it's best just to take the sheer sonic force as reflecting the band's concept, rather than trying to piece it all together.""
Metal Injection concluded ""Kveldssanger had no electric instruments, Nattens madrigal had no acoustic instruments, but Bergtatt, has both acoustic and electric instruments; it's like they spliced the elements from Bergtatt into two separate albums. If that's the case, then Nattens madrigal really showcases the black metal prowess of the band. The album answers exactly why people were so angered by Ulver's transition away from black metal, and why people are still bitter at their direction today.""
In 1997, Century Media issued The Trilogie – Three Journeyes Through the Norwegian Netherworlde, a limited edition collection, containing Bergtatt, Kveldssanger and Nattens madrigal in LP Picture Disc format, housed in a cardboard box, with a booklet and bonus posters.

Beyond black metal (1998–2002)
In 1997, Rygg invited composer and sound architect Tore Ylwizaker into the collective in order to expand their artistic and musical visions; and together they stepped over the boundaries of black metal aesthetics, creating a genre-defying work in Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, released in December 1998. The album was issued through Rygg's own imprint, Jester Records, a label born out of discord between Ulver and Century Media. Musically, the album blended electronics, industrial music elements, progressive metal and experimental rock, adding ambient passages. Lyrically, the album incorporates the entire text of William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, utilising guest vocalists on several songs. The album received widespread acclaim from critics within both the rock/metal and alternative music press - being awarded ""album of the month"" in several high-profile magazines such as Terrorizer, Metal Hammer, and Rock Hard and ranked highly in their end of year's best polls. However, the album's transitional nature perhaps alienated many fans of the band's first three albums — causing a backlash from the black metal scene.
Ulver, now only consisting of Rygg and Ylwizaker, issued an EP, Metamorphosis, in September 1999. The music moving to the more heavily electronic approach, bridging the gap to the film-noir ambiance of 2000's full-length album Perdition City.  In the sleeve notes to Metamorphosis, the group declared:

Ulver is obviously not a black metal band and does not wish to be stigmatized as such. We acknowledge the relation of part I & III of the Trilogie (Bergtatt & Nattens Madrigal) to this culture, but stress that these endeavours were written as stepping stones rather than conclusions. We are proud of our former instincts, but wish to liken our association with said genre to that of the snake with Eve. An incentive to further frolic only. If this discourages you in any way, please have the courtesy to refrain from voicing superficial remarks regarding our music and/or personae. We are as unknown to you as we always were.
Perdition City, issued in March 2000, was described as moody, atmospheric electronica, cinematic in scope, evoking a soundtrack for an imaginary film. Kerrang! praised the album, ranking it top ten that year, noting ""This ain't rock 'n roll. This is evolution on such a grand scale that most bands wouldn't even be able to wrap their tiny little minds around it."" Musically, Ulver not only explores new genres, but also shift from extrovert, into more introverted moods, or interior music.
Later that year, Jørn H. Sværen joined the band. The band followed up Perdition City with two improv/minimalist/ambient/glitch companion EPs, called Silence Teaches You How to Sing and Silencing the Singing, in September and December 2001, respectively. The material featured here was loosely recorded during the sessions for the Perdition City album. The style is more experimental/atmospheric and less beat-oriented; rather mood pieces that revolve around the Perdition City theme. Due to the experimental nature of the music, both Silence EPs were limited to two thousand, and three thousand copies. However, both EPs were re-released as one disc, under the title Teachings in Silence, in November 2002.
Ulver, now with more confidence in their ambient sensibilities descent into the world of film soundtracks, producing scores for Lyckantropen (issued as Lyckantropen Themes, in November 2002), Svidd neger (issued as Svidd neger, in September 2003) and a joint soundtrack with singer/songwriter Tom McRae for the multiple award-winning Uno. Ulver were praised for their soundtrack work, and their ability to adapt and providing a sense of continuity to each film. The song ""Silence Teaches You How to Sing"" was later used in the 2012 supernatural horror film Sinister.
Ulver celebrated their ten-year anniversary with a remix album, 1993–2003: 1st Decade in the Machines, issued in April 2003, featuring contributions from Third Eye Foundation, Bogdan Raczynski, Fennesz, V/Vm and Merzbow.
In 2002, the trio announced that they were working on a string remake of Nattens madrigal, but Rygg later stated that the project ""is in a state of total dormancy.""

Blood Inside and Shadows of the Sun (2003–2008)
In August 2003, Ulver issued an EP, A Quick Fix of Melancholy, essentially a teaser for the forthcoming album, Blood Inside. A delicate marriage of orchestration and electronica the EP features text by Christian Bök and a remix of a song from Kveldssanger.
In 2004, the group collaborated with Sámi vocalist Mari Boine and percussionist Marilyn Mazur to score Mona J. Hoel's film Salto, salmiakk og kaffe. The film premiered in August 2004, however, the soundtrack remains unreleased.
Ulver issued Blood Inside in June 2005, produced together with King Crimson collaborator Ronan Chris Murphy. The album returns to more classical arrangements and instrumentation, described as ""a beautifully crafted album of both substance and style. Certainly, Blood Inside is still not for everyone, but those who choose to indulge in this will find themselves rewarded on every level."" ""[Blood Inside] is ambiguous and full of intricate layers and influences working to tell a story that is both haunting and mesmerising. Garm's beautiful distorted vocals act as outcries of a desperate man hidden, pushed in the background of the story that the instrumentation tells."" Webzine Avantgarde-metal.com concludes: ""the sound of the album is maybe their most extravagant, extrovert, dynamic and wild, ranging from swing band to danceable hard electronic pop, with a lot of peaceful moments in between so much energy.""
Ulver and drone metal band Sunn O))) collaborated on the fifteen-minute track ""CUT WOODeD"" - a tribute to the deceased film director Ed Wood, which later appeared on Sunn O)))'s WHITEbox box set, issued in July 2006.
Shadows of the Sun was issued in October 2007 in Europe and the United States and would include collaborations with artists Pamelia Kurstin contributing theremin, Mathias Eick on trumpet and Christian Fennesz, adding supplemental shimmer. Rygg described it as ""our most personal record to date."" Described as ""low-key, dark and tragic,"" the album received critical acclaim, and in February 2008 the album won the Oslo Awards for Album of the Year, in 2008. The album was also voted best album of 2007 at the website Sonic Frontiers.

Changes in personnel (2009–2012)
In 2009, Ulver announced it would become a quartet. Its three extant members — Kristoffer Rygg, Tore Ylwizaker and Jørn H. Sværen — enlisted British composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan (Æthenor, Guapo, Mothlite) into the collective. Ole Alexander Halstensgård was another prominent musician to be included in the live-act.
The band accepted an invitation to appear at the Norwegian Festival of Literature, at Maihaugsalen (part of Maihaugen) in Lillehammer, Norway on 30 May 2009. The collective were accompanied by guest musicians Lars Pedersen (aka When) on drums, Pamelia Kurstin playing Theremin and Halstensgård (a founding member of Norwegian group Paperboys). The success of this performance lead to them embarking on a string of other live performances in 2009 and 2010, selling out prestigious venues, such as the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, Volksbühne in Berlin and La Cigale in Paris before they returned to their homeland for their performance at The Norwegian Opera House. Ulver were the first band outside the established Norwegian music scene to be invited to play at the Opera House.
The first album to feature the quartet is Wars of the Roses, issued in April 2011 via Kscope, preceded by a single, ""February MMX,"" in February. The album entered the Norwegian National Album Charts at Number 17. SputnikMusic noted, ""Wars of the Roses' thoughtful conception and execution serves only for a thoughtful listen. After all this time, it still remains a privilege to bear witness to these wolves evolve once again."" Murat Batmaz, commenting for Sea of Tranquility webzine, noted, ""it amalgamates musical traits from its predecessors while re-shaping them with a more direct approach.""
In November 2011, Kscope released The Norwegian National Opera, a film documenting Ulver's performance at The Norwegian National Opera on 31 July 2010. Described as ""mesmerizing and stunningly beautiful"" and ""a unique and at times hypnotic live experience; far from a conventional one; more akin to a piece of performance art than a standard concert.""
Ulver's next project, Childhood's End came in the form of a collection of covers of ""60s psychedelic chestnuts"", issued on Jester Records, under license to Kscope, in May 2012. The album, a reinterpretation of '60s psychedelia, was intended by Ulver as a reflection on lost innocence. The album received favourable reviews; Ben Ratliffe, writing for The New York Times, praised Childhood's End for its treatment of the original music, commenting that ""these cover versions reward the ambition of the original songs, draping them with stateliness."" Placing the album in the context of Ulver's discography, Ratliffe noted that Childhood's End is ""the most straight-ahead Ulver record ever, but still strange"". A music video for ""Magic Hollow"", directed by Justin Oakey, was released in April 2012.
In 2012, Roadburn Records issued an installment in their Roadburn EP series on 7″ vinyl, featuring the songs ""I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)"" b/w ""Reverberation (Doubt)."" Limited to 500 copies, of which 100 copies is gold vinyl - the release commemorated Ulver's performance at the Roadburn Festival, 013, Tilburg, in the Netherlands, on 12 April 2012. The full performance at the festival was issued as Live at Roadburn in June 2013 via Roadburn Records. It was the first and only time tracks from Childhood's End were performed live.
Announcing a new DIY approach, Ulver released a press statement, The Art of Dying, an articulated rant about the changes in the record industry. The band collected some covers and curiosities, and made them available to download as Oddities & Rarities#1, including material from tribute albums and the Uno soundtrack.

Messe I.X–VI.X (2012–2015)
Ulver were commissioned in 2012 by the Tromsø Kulturhus (House of Culture) in Norway, in a cooperation with the Arctic Opera and Philharmonic Orchestra cultural institution to compose and perform a Mass. With additional aid and advice from composer Martin Romberg, and contemporary composers/musicians Ole-Henrik Moe and Kari Rønnekleiv, Messe I.X–VI.X was composed and first performed live by Ulver, alongside the Tromsø Chamber Orchestra on 21 September 2012. The band then took the recordings back to Crystal Canyon, Oslo and spent winter and spring in post-production, honing the material for its studio-equivalent. Issued in August 2013, Ulver's tenth studio album received universal critical acclaim, described as ""a challenging work and an album of rare beauty"".
In January 2014, Ulver collaborated with Norway's National Theatre, providing the soundtrack to Demoner 2014 (translated Demons 2014); based on a text by Geir Gulliksen, in turn freely based on the Dostoyevsky novel Demons (also known as The Possessed), the play premiered on 8 February 2014.
On 2 January 2014, Ulver announced an 11-date European tour, ""the February dates will consist of partly new and improv-based material, likely to revolve around motifs already familiar to our familiars. We are looking forward to get out there, and hope for some interesting music to be born those evenings and nights. We also aim to document some of it for those of you who cannot come.""
Ulver released a collaboration album with Sunn O))), entitled Terrestrials, issued in February 2014 via Southern Lord. Produced by Rygg and Stephen O'Malley, it has been described as ""three live improvisation pieces"". On 10 December 2013, a sample from the closing track, ""Eternal Return,"" was released for streaming. It was also streamed on Pitchfork Advance on the day it was released, until 10 February 2014.
In April 2014, Century Media announced Trolsk Sortmetall 1993-1997, collecting together the albums Bergtatt, Kveldssanger and Nattens madrigal, as well as the band's original demo cassette, Vargnatt, and other rarities.
In July 2014, Ulver contributed a cover of Shirley Collins' ""Poor Murdered Woman"" in support of Burning Bridges & Fifth Column Film's project The Ballad of Shirley Collins. A film, book and tribute album honouring the life and work of this musical pioneer and folk legend.
On 3 June 2015 on the band's official website, in a statement titled Only Theatre of Pain, Ulver announce a number of forthcoming projects; including Messe in Concert at the distinguished Teatro Regio, Parma, Italy, 16 November 2013, with the Mg_Inc Orchestra. A live document of their concert featuring Pamelia Kurstin, including 15 minutes of new music written and performed specifically for the scene and topped up with full orchestra versions of ""Little Blue Bird"" and ""Eos"". They continue to announce their newest works, tentatively titled The Assassination of Julius Caesar, with texts and themes in development.

ATGCLVLSSCAP, Riverhead and The Assassination of Julius Caesar (2015–2019)
On 15 October 2015, in an interview with website Steel for Brains, Ulver announced ATGCLVLSSCAP, a double album with over 80 minutes worth of material, consisting of multitracked and studio-enhanced live, mostly improvisational, rock and electronic soundscapes, 2/3 of which had never been heard before. Announcing further details on 28 October, the album was released on 22 January 2016 on Vinyl and CD formats via newly formed, London-based label House of Mythology. The basis for the album – which the band worked on under the moniker 12 – arrives from recordings made at twelve different live shows that Ulver performed in February 2014, in which the band played a set improvisatory ""free rock"" performances. Band member Daniel O'Sullivan took the multitrack recordings, sculpting and editing hours of material in his North London home, before Anders Møller, Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker got involved, completing the recordings at Subsonic Society and Oak Hill Studios, Oslo.
In 2016, the band composed the score for the Canadian drama film Riverhead. In October, a new studio album, The Assassination of Julius Caesar was announced to be released on 7 April as well as a performance at the 2017 edition of Roadburn Festival. A string of festival dates were subsequently added. The album showed the band switching directions in terms of musical stylisms once again, focusing on a sound that was described by AllMusic critic Thom Jurek as ""drenched in moody '80s synth pop."" On 11 November 2017, Ulver released Sic Transit Gloria Mundi, a 3-track EP with two songs taken from The Assassination of Julius Caesar recording sessions, and a Frankie Goes to Hollywood cover, ""The Power of Love"".

Drone Activity, Flowers of Evil, and Scary Muzak (2019–present)
On 1 March, Ulver shared a short excerpt of music, titled ""Blood, Fire, Woods, Diamonds"", on their Facebook page. Two days later, they announced a new live album, titled Drone Activity, consisting of four new pieces of live music edited in studio following a process reminiscent of the one used of ATGCLVLSSCAP. On 4 April, the band shared a second excerpt from the album, titled ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"". The album was released on 11 May 2019.
Ulver announced their plans for 2020 through Norwegian publication Ballade on 17 October 2019: ""Ulver is working on a new album, planned to be released in 2020. (...) The Norwegian cult band is also preparing a retrospective book about the band's history through the 1990s and up until today."" A European tour was scheduled for May 2020, however, it was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, Flowers of Evil was announced and was released on 28 August through House of Mythology. The singles ""Russian Doll"", ""Little Boy"" and ""Nostalgia"" were released in advance. On the same day, Wolves Evolve: The Ulver Story, a limited edition book written by Tore Engelsen Espedal, Phil Alexander, Nile Bowie and Torolf Kroglund and detailing the band's history was released as well.
Ulver released their thirteenth album Scary Muzak on October 31, 2021. Five of the twelve songs on Scary Muzak are covers from the soundtrack to John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween.

Underworld (band),"Underworld are a British electronic music group formed in 1987 in Cardiff, Wales and the principal collaborative project of Karl Hyde and Rick Smith. Prominent former members include Darren Emerson, from 1990 to 2000, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.
After briefly performing as a funk and synth-pop outfit, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence after reshaping into a dance and techno band, releasing albums including Dubnobasswithmyheadman (1994), Second Toughest in the Infants (1996) and Beaucoup Fish (1999), as well as singles  ""Born Slippy Nuxx"" and ""Dark & Long (Dark Train)"". Known for their atmospheric, progressive compositions, Hyde's cryptic and stream of consciousness lyrics, and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and have been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

History
The Screen Gemz, Freur, and Underworld Mk1
In the late 1970s, Karl Hyde and Rick Smith formed a band in Cardiff called the Screen Gemz, which was influenced by Kraftwerk and reggae. They were joined by bassist Alfie Thomas, drummer Bryn Burrows, and keyboardist John Warwicker in forming Freur. The band signed to CBS Records and released Doot-Doot (1983). Freur disbanded in 1986 after CBS withheld the UK release of their followup album, Get Us out of Here.
In 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bassist Baz Allen formed Underworld, named after the 1985 horror film Underworld, which was scored by Freur. Underworld signed to Sire Records and released the album Underneath the Radar in 1988. Following the departure of Burrows, they released another album, Change the Weather, in 1989. This lineup, referred to by the group as ""Underworld Mk1"", disbanded in 1990.

Emerson's arrival and Underworld Mk2
After a break—to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project Tomato—Hyde and Smith recruited DJ Darren Emerson and signed to Steven Hall's Junior Boys Own label. After several releases and remixes as Lemon Interupt and Steppin' Razor, they readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable techno as a trio (""Underworld Mk2"").
The addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of found material from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of acid house.

Trainspotting and breakthrough
The band's 1996 album, Second Toughest in the Infants, was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film Trainspotting. The film featured ""Dark & Long (Dark Train)"", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, ""Born Slippy Nuxx"", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the Second Toughest album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of techno, house, drum and bass and experimental music. ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless compilations, mashups and remixes.

Beaucoup Fish era
After the release of fifth studio album Beaucoup Fish in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with alcoholism but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on DAT. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track ""Jumbo"". The band originally wanted to call the album Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK ITV programme Stars in Their Eyes) but were convinced by their record company, Junior Boy's Own, that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, Beaucoup Fish Singles, which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.
Underworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called Everything, Everything, the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group Tomato. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: ""Moaner"", ""Puppies"", ""Kittens"" and ""Rowla"". The disco scene in Vanilla Sky features Underworld's 1993 hit ""Rez"". Their tour was also documented by Danish film director Helene Moltke-Leth and shown on The Danish National Broadcasting Corporation (DR).

Emerson's departure and back to a duo
After the release and promotion of Everything, Everything, Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, A Hundred Days Off, released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled 1992–2002 was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as ""Bigmouth"", ""Spikee"", ""Dirty"" and ""8 Ball"". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.
During their tour, they released a 3-CD set Live in Tokyo, which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled Riverrun. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released The Misterons Mix, a special retrospective mix composed of Riverrun tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three Riverrun releases.
In September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) 12"" vinyl releases, containing remixes of various Riverrun tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the Beatport website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with Gabriel Yared to compose the music score to Anthony Minghella's film Breaking and Entering. The soundtrack was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.

Oblivion with Bells
Underworld's seventh studio album, Oblivion with Bells, was released on 16 October 2007. The first single from the new album, ""Crocodile"", was released on 5 September 2007. U2's drummer Larry Mullen Jr helped out on the track ""Boy, Boy, Boy"". Underworld, in collaboration with composer John Murphy, completed the soundtrack to the Danny Boyle film, Sunshine, in late 2006. Well over a year after the film's release, the official soundtrack was released on iTunes on 25 November 2008.
On 16 June 2007, Underworld were forced to cancel their show at the Ejekt Festival in Athens, Greece. Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the Beastie Boys were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment. On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band. The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.
On 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the All Points West Music & Arts Festival in Liberty State Park, New Jersey. Karl Hyde appeared with Brian Eno on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. ""Pure Scenius"" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio the Necks, electronic artist Jon Hopkins and guitarist Leo Abrahams.
Underworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled ""Between Stars"" at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.
On 8 March 2010, Mark Knight and D. Ramirez released the single ""Downpipe"", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the ""Playhouse"", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in Dublin.

Barking
On 13 May 2010, the band released a track called ""Scribble"" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with ""You Do Scribble"", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with High Contrast, a drum and bass DJ also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of ""Scribble"" was featured on Pete Tong's Radio 1 radio show, declaring it as Essential New Tune of the week. The group also released a video clip for ""Scribble"" on YouTube. It has been commercially released on 28 June as the lead single from their latest album.
Underworld's eighth studio album, Barking, was released on 13 September 2010 in the UK. The album features collaborations with German trance producer Paul van Dyk and British house artists Mark Knight and D. Ramirez, among others.
On 25 August 2010, Rick Smith released a limited edition solo album Bungalow With Stairs 1, music to accompany ""What's Going on in Your Head When You're Dancing"" an exhibition of paintings by Karl Hyde at the Laforet Museum, Harajuku, Tokyo during 2010. The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with Trainspotting director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of Frankenstein at the Royal National Theatre. The production was broadcast as a part of National Theatre Live on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011.

Anthology, the Olympics and solo projects
In November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, A Collection and 1992–2012 Anthology. A Collection features many of the band's biggest tracks alongside recent collaborations with High Contrast featuring Tiësto & Underworld (""The First Note Is Silent""), Mark Knight & D. Ramirez (""Downpipe"") and Brian Eno (""Beebop Hurry""). 1992–2012 Anthology is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of 1992–2002 with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.
In December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director Danny Boyle. The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: ""And I Will Kiss"" (featuring Dame Evelyn Glennie with the Pandemonium Drummers) and ""Caliban's Dream"" in collaboration with the Dockhead Choir, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Only Men Aloud, Elizabeth Roberts, Esme Smith (band member Rick Smith's daughter) and Alex Trimble. Underworld contributed 11 of the 36 tracks on the soundtrack, Isles of Wonder. For their work on the Olympics, Underworld won the 2012 Q Award for Innovation in Sound.
On 22 April 2013, Karl Hyde released his debut solo album Edgeland. In 2014, he went on to release two collaborative albums with Brian Eno titled Someday World on 5 May and High Life on 30 June. Rick Smith went on to do some solo work, with two of his musical works being for projects by frequent collaborator director Danny Boyle. His first work was the soundtrack to Boyle's 2013 film Trance and the score for the 2014 British drama television series Babylon which Boyle co-created and directed the 90 minute pilot.

Reissues and Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future
In 2014, the group announced their intention to release remastered and expanded editions of all of their studio albums ""in the next few years"". An expanded edition of Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released on 6 October 2014 and the group toured in support of the album. An expanded edition of Second Toughest in the Infants was released on 20 November 2015. Just four days after the re-release of Second Toughest, on 24 November, Underworld announced a new album (their first studio album in six years) titled Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future, released on 18 March 2016. The album earned a 2017 Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album. They embarked on a brief European tour in support of the album. The tour was later expanded to include the United States, Japan and Australia. In 2017, joining once again with frequent collaborator Danny Boyle, Smith wrote the musical score and produced the soundtrack for T2 Trainspotting. On 25 August 2017, they released an expanded, remastered edition of Beaucoup Fish.

The World of Underworld and Drift
On 21 May 2018, Underworld announced a new project called the World of Underworld. Part of the project involves reflecting on and sometimes reimagining their nearly 30 year body of work. But it also serves as an outlet for experimentation, new releases, and spontaneous creativity. The first new song released as part of the World of Underworld, ""Brilliant Yes That Would Be"", was recorded and mixed just days before it was released. Another new song, ""Bells & Circles"", was a collaboration with Iggy Pop that came out of sessions recorded a couple years earlier for possible inclusion on the T2 Trainspotting soundtrack. The remaining songs from that collaboration formed a joint four-track EP Teatime Dub Encounters, released on 27 July 2018.
On 1 November 2018, Underworld started a year-long experimental music-and-video project named Drift, which aimed to release the band's new and previously unreleased material on a weekly basis. The full album titled Drift Series 1 was released on 1 November 2019, and concluded the band's 52 week Drift project. Drift Series 1 received critical acclaim. On Metacritic, a review aggregator that assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 86, based on 6 reviews, which indicates ""universal acclaim"".

Influence on video game composers
Underworld have been mentioned as an influence by a number of video game composers, such as Nobuyoshi Sano, Andrew Sega, Jesper Kyd, Michiel van den Bos, and Rom Di Prisco.

Charity
In 2008, the band participated in an album called Songs for Tibet, ""to express our support for the Tibetan people... at a time when the eyes of the world are on China"" (referring to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing). The album was issued on 5 August via iTunes and on 19 August in music stores around the world.

Karl Hyde interviewed in Chaos Control Digizin (2007)"
Vangelis,"Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou (Greek: Ευάγγελος Οδυσσέας Παπαθανασίου, pronounced [eˈvaɲɟelos oðiˈseas papaθanaˈsi.u]; 29 March 1943 – 17 May 2022), known professionally as Vangelis ( vang-GHEL-iss; Greek: Βαγγέλης, pronounced [vaɲˈɟelis]), was a Greek keyboardist, composer, and producer of electronic, progressive, ambient, and classical orchestral music. He composed the Academy Award-winning score to Chariots of Fire (1981), as well as for the films Blade Runner (1982), Missing (1982), Antarctica (1983), The Bounty (1984), 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), and Alexander (2004), and the 1980 PBS documentary series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage by Carl Sagan.
Born in Agria and raised in Athens, Vangelis began his career in the 1960s as a member of the rock bands The Forminx and Aphrodite's Child; the latter's album 666 (1972) is now recognised as a progressive-psychedelic rock classic. Vangelis first settled in Paris, and gained initial recognition for his scores to the Frédéric Rossif animal documentaries L'Apocalypse des Animaux, La Fête sauvage, and Opéra sauvage. He also released his first solo albums during this time, and performed as a solo artist. In 1975, Vangelis relocated to London where he built his home recording facility named Nemo Studios and released a series of successful and influential albums for RCA Records, including: Heaven and Hell (1975), Albedo 0.39 (1976), Spiral (1977), and China (1979). From 1979 to 1986, Vangelis performed in a duo with Yes vocalist Jon Anderson, releasing several albums as Jon and Vangelis. He also collaborated with Irene Papas on two albums of Greek traditional and religious songs.
Vangelis reached his commercial peak in the 1980s and 1990s. His score for Chariots of Fire (1981) won him an Academy Award for Best Original Score and the film's main theme, ""Chariots of Fire – Titles"" went to number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, while his score for 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the film's soundtrack and main theme topped the European charts selling millions of copies. His compilation albums Themes (1989), Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear) (1996), and studio album Voices (1995) also sold well at the time. Vangelis composed the official anthem of the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Korea and Japan. In his last twenty years, Vangelis collaborated with NASA and ESA on music projects Mythodea (1993), Rosetta (2016), and Juno to Jupiter (2021), his 23rd and final studio album.
Having had a career in music spanning over 50 years and having composed and performed more than 50 albums, Vangelis is one of the most important figures in the history of electronic music, and modern film music. He used many electronic instruments in a fashion of a ""one-man quasi-classical orchestra"" composing and performing on the first take.

Early life
Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou was born on 29 March 1943 in Agria, a coastal town in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece, and raised in Athens. His father Odysseus worked in property and was an amateur sprinter; Vangelis described him as ""a great lover of music"". His mother Foteini Kyriakopoulou was trained as a soprano. Vangelis had one brother, Nikos. Vangelis recalled a peaceful and happy childhood without interference from his parents, who let him be involved in his activities, mainly consisting of playing the piano, painting, and constructing things with his hands. 
Vangelis developed an interest in music at age four, composing on the family piano and experimenting with sounds by placing nails and kitchen pans inside it and with radio interference. When he was six his parents enrolled him for music lessons, but was unable to take to formal tuition as he preferred to develop technique on his own. In later life he considered himself fortunate to have not attended music school, thinking it would have impeded his creativity. He never learned to read or write music, instead playing from memory: ""When the teachers asked me to play something, I would pretend that I was reading it and play from memory. I didn't fool them, but I didn't care.""  One of his piano teachers was Greek composer Aristotelis Koundouroff.
Vangelis found traditional Greek music an important influence in his childhood, but at 12 developed an interest in jazz and rock music. At fifteen he formed a band with school friends who had similar musical interests. Three years later, he acquired a Hammond organ. In 1963, following brief stints in art college and an apprenticeship in filmmaking, Vangelis and three school friends started a five-piece rock band, The Forminx (or The Formynx), named after the Ancient Greek string instrument. The group played covers and original material largely written by Vangelis, whose stage name at this time was Vagos, with English lyrics by radio DJ and record producer Nico Mastorakis. After nine singles and one Christmas EP, which found success across Europe, the group disbanded in 1966.

Career
1963–1974: Early solo projects and Aphrodite's Child
After The Forminx split, Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound as a composer and producer. He wrote the score to several Greek films–My Brother, the Traffic Policeman (1963), 5,000 Lies (1966) by Giorgos Konstantinou, Antique Rally (1966), Frenzy (1966), To Prosopo tis Medousas (1967) by Nikos Koundouros, and Apollo Goes on Holiday (1968).
In 1967, the 25-year-old Vangelis formed a psychedelic/progressive rock band with Demis Roussos, Loukas Sideras, and Anargyros ""Silver"" Koulouris. Initially known as The Papathanassiou Set, they were encouraged by the Greek division of Philips Records to try their luck in England after their demo was passed onto Mercury Records and was well received. The relocation appealed to the group, as the political turmoil surrounding the 1967 Greek coup limited their opportunities. However, Koulouris was called up for military service, causing the band to travel without a guitarist. After the trio were denied entry into England due to problems with their work permits they settled in Paris, where they signed with Phillips and renamed themselves Aphrodite's Child. Their debut single ""Rain and Tears"" was a commercial success in Europe, and was followed by the albums End of the World (1968) and It's Five O'Clock (1969). Vangelis conceived the idea of their third, 666 (1972), a double concept album based on the Book of Revelation. It is widely recognized as a progressive-psychedelic rock classic. In 1971, the group split following increasing tensions during the recording of 666, although Vangelis would produce several of Roussos' future albums and singles. Vangelis recalled after the split: ""I couldn't follow the commercial way anymore, it was very boring. You have to do something like that in the beginning for showbiz, but after you start doing the same thing everyday you can't continue.""
Vangelis spent six years in Paris; he was moved by the 1968 French student riots and felt obliged to stay, during which he accepted various solo projects in film, television, and theatre. He composed the score for the films Sex Power (1970), Salut, Jerusalem (1972), and Amore (1974). A soundtrack album recorded for a 1970 wildlife documentary series by Frédéric Rossif was released as L'Apocalypse des animaux in 1973. In 1971, Vangelis took part in several jam sessions with various musicians in London, the recordings from which were released on two albums released in 1978 without his permission–Hypothesis and The Dragon. He took legal action and had them withdrawn. His first solo album, Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit (French for Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night), was released in 1972. Inspired by the 1968 riots, Vangelis wrote a ""poème symphonique"" to express his solidarity with the students, comprising music with news snippets and protest songs; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the demonstrations.
In 1973, Vangelis released his second solo album Earth, a percussive-orientated album with various additional musicians, including Koulouris and Robert Fitoussi. In May 1973 he performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London supporting Tempest, but looked back on the concert as a failure. The line-up featured on Earth released a single titled ""Who"" under the name Odyssey, and performed live with Vangelis at his concert at the Paris Olympia in February 1974. Several months later Vangelis returned to England to audition with the progressive rock band Yes, after singer Jon Anderson had become a fan of his music and invited him to replace departing keyboardist Rick Wakeman. After problems with obtaining a work visa and a rejection from the Musician's Union, plus his reluctance to travel and tour, Vangelis declined. Yes chose Swiss player Patrick Moraz, who used Vangelis's keyboards in his audition.

1974–1980: Move to London, solo breakthrough, and Jon and Vangelis
By the end of 1974 Vangelis was finally able to relocate to England, by which time he also felt he ""outgrew France"" musically. He settled in a flat on Queen's Gate, London and set up a 16-track recording facility named Nemo Studios on Hampden Gurney Street in Marble Arch, which he named his ""laboratory"". In August 1975, he signed a four-album deal with RCA Records, for which he released a series of influential electronic-based albums that increased his profile. The first of these was Heaven and Hell (1975), a concept album based on duality that features Anderson singing lead vocals on ""So Long Ago, So Clear"" and the English Chamber Choir. The album went to No. 31 in the UK, and was performed live in concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1976. The album was followed by the UK top 20 Albedo 0.39 (1976), Spiral (1977), and the spontaneous Beaubourg (1978), each having their own thematic inspiration including astronomy and physical cosmology, Tao philosophy, and Vangelis' visit to the Centre Georges Pompidou, respectively. 
During the same period, Vangelis composed the score for Do You Hear the Dogs Barking? directed by François Reichenbach. This was released in 1975 under the French title Entends-tu les chiens aboyer? and re-released two years later as Ignacio. In 1976, Vangelis released his second soundtrack for a Rossif animal documentary, La Fête sauvage, which combined African rhythms with Western music. This was followed in 1979 by a third soundtrack for Rossif, Opéra sauvage. The music itself would be re-used in other films, including the track ""L'Enfant"" in The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) by Peter Weir; the melody of the same track (in marching band format) can also be heard at the beginning of the 1924 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies scene in the film Chariots of Fire while the track ""Hymne"" was used in Barilla pasta commercials in Italy and Ernest & Julio Gallo wine ads in the United States. Rossif and Vangelis again collaborated for Sauvage et Beau (1984) and De Nuremberg à Nuremberg (1989).
By 1979, Vangelis signed with Polydor Records. His first release was China (1979), based on Chinese culture. Vangelis returned to his Greek roots by recording new arrangements of Greek folk songs with actress and singer Irene Papas. The first set of songs were released under Papas' name as the album Odes, which was an instant success in Greece. and would be followed in 1986 by a second album, Rapsodies. In complete contrast, 1980 saw the release of See You Later, a much more experimental and satirical album of concept pieces and unusual pop songs with vocal contributions from Pete Marsh, Cherry Vanilla, and Yes singer Jon Anderson, as well as a rare example of Vangelis singing himself (deliberately badly).
Vangelis had already begun a more extensive collaboration with Jon Anderson in 1979, as the duo Jon and Vangelis. Their debut album, Short Stories (1980), reached No. 4 in the UK. They went on to release three more albums; The Friends of Mr Cairo, Private Collection, and Page of Life released in 1981, 1983, and 1991, respectively. The first two albums produced three hit singles ""I Hear You Now"", ""I'll Find My Way Home"" and ""State of Independence"", with the latter later becoming a hit for the second time when covered by Donna Summer with production by Quincy Jones.
Vangelis' music was brought to an even wider audience when excerpts from Heaven and Hell and Albedo 0.39 were used for the soundtrack of Carl Sagan's 1980 television documentary series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. In 1986, Vangelis composed new music for a special edition episode. Vangelis recalled that Sagan sent him recordings of sounds collected by satellites, which he claimed were exactly what he had heard as a child.

1981–2002: Mainstream success
Film and television
Vangelis composed and performed on the soundtrack for Chariots of Fire (1981), a historical drama film directed by Hugh Hudson. He accepted the job because ""I liked the people I was working with. It was a very humble, low-budget film."" The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films featured orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis's music was modern and synthesiser-oriented. Released in 1981, it gained mainstream commercial success which increased Vangelis's profile as a result. The opening instrumental piece, ""Titles"", later named ""Chariots of Fire – Titles"", was released as a single spent one week at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 after a five-month climb. The soundtrack album was No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for four weeks and sold one million copies in the US. In March 1982, Vangelis won an Academy Award for Best Original Music Score, but refused to attend the awards ceremony, partly due to his fear of flying. He turned down an offer to stay in a stateroom aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 for a boat crossing. Vangelis commented that the ""main inspiration was the story itself. The rest I did instinctively, without thinking about anything else, other than to express my feelings with the technological means available to me at the time"". The song was used at the 1984 Winter Olympics and it was described as the work for which Vangelis was best known.
Vangelis received numerous subsequent offers to score films, but he turned them down because he wanted to avoid becoming ""a factory of film music"". In 1981, he scored the documentary film Pablo Picasso Painter by Frédéric Rossif. It was the third such score by Vangelis as he had previously scored documentaries about Georges Mathieu and Georges Braque. He composed the score of Missing (1982) directed by Costa-Gavras, which was awarded the Palme d'Or and gained Vangelis a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. Other soundtracks he produced during this time include Antarctica for the film Nankyoku Monogatari (1983), one of the highest-grossing movies in Japan's film history, and The Bounty in 1984. He declined an offer to score 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
In 1981, Vangelis collaborated with director Ridley Scott to score his science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). Critics have written that in capturing the isolation and melancholy of Harrison Ford's character, Rick Deckard, the Vangelis score is as much a part of the dystopian environment as the decaying buildings and ever-present rain. The score was nominated for a BAFTA and Golden Globe award. Blade Runner has subsequently become one of Vangelis' best-known works, despite problems that prevented its release on album for many years. A disagreement led to Vangelis withholding permission for his recordings to be released, so the studio hired musicians dubbed the New American Orchestra to release orchestral adaptations of the original score. The problem was eventually resolved twelve years later, when Vangelis's own work was released in 1994. Even then, the release was considered incomplete, since the film contained other Vangelis compositions that were not included on the record. This, in turn, was resolved in 2007 when a box set of the score was released to commemorate the film's 25th anniversary, containing the 1994 album, some previously unreleased music cues, and new original Vangelis material inspired by Blade Runner.
In 1992, Paramount Pictures released the film 1492: Conquest of Paradise, also directed by Ridley Scott, as a 500th anniversary commemoration of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World. Vangelis's score was nominated as ""Best Original Score – Motion Picture"" at the 1993 Golden Globe awards, but was not nominated for an Academy Award. Due to its success, Vangelis won an Echo Award as ""International Artist Of The Year"", and RTL Golden Lion Award for the ""Best Title Theme for a TV Film or a Series"" in 1996.
Vangelis wrote the score for the film Bitter Moon (1992) directed by Roman Polanski, and The Plague directed by Luis Puenzo. In the 90s, Vangelis scored undersea documentaries for French ecologist and filmmaker, Jacques Cousteau, one of which was shown at the Earth Summit. The score of the film Cavafy (1996) directed by Yannis Smaragdis, gained an award at the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent and Valencia International Film Festival.

Theatre and stage productions
In the early 1980s Vangelis began composing for ballet and theatre stage plays. In 1983 he wrote the music for Michael Cacoyannis' staging of the Greek tragedy Elektra which was performed with Irene Papas at the open-air amphitheater at Epidavros in Greece. The same year Vangelis composed his first ballet score, for a production by Wayne Eagling. It was originally performed by Lesley Collier and Eagling himself at an Amnesty International gala at the Drury Lane theatre. In 1984 the Royal Ballet School presented it again at the Sadler's Wells theatre. In 1985 and 1986, Vangelis wrote music for two more ballets: ""Frankenstein – Modern Prometheus"" and ""The Beauty and the Beast"". In 1992, Vangelis wrote the music for a restaging of the Euripides play, Medea, that featured Irene Papas. In 2001 he composed for a third play which starred Papas, and for 
a version of William Shakespeare's The Tempest staged by Hungarian director György Schwajdas.

Solo albums and collaborations
Vangelis collaborated in 1976 with Italian singer Patty Pravo with the album Tanto and with Italian singer Milva achieving success, especially in Germany, with the albums Ich hab' keine Angst also translated in French as Moi, Je N'ai Pas Peur (1981) and Geheimnisse in 1986 (I have no fear and Secrets), also translated in Italian as Tra due sogni.
An Italian language Nana Mouskouri album featured her singing the Vangelis composition ""Ti Amerò"". Collaborations with lyricist Mikalis Bourboulis, sung by Maria Farantouri, included the tracks ""Odi A"", ""San Elektra"", and ""Tora Xero"".
Vangelis released Soil Festivities in 1984. It was thematically inspired by the interaction between nature and its microscopic living creatures; Invisible Connections (1985) took inspiration from the world of elementary particles invisible to the naked eye; Mask (1985) was inspired by the theme of the mask, an obsolete artefact which was used in ancient times for concealment or amusement; and Direct (1988). The last of the aforementioned efforts was the first album to be recorded in Vangelis's post-Nemo Studios era.
Vangelis performed his only concert in the U.S. on 7 November 1986 at Royce Hall on the campus of University of California, Los Angeles. It featured a special guest appearance by Jon Anderson.
There were another five solo albums in the 1990s; The City (1990) was recorded during a stay in Rome in 1989, and reflected a day of bustling city life, from dawn until dusk; Voices (1995) featured sensual songs filled with nocturnal orchestrations; Oceanic (1996) thematically explored the mystery of underwater worlds and sea sailing; and two classical albums about El Greco – Foros Timis Ston Greco (1995), which had a limited release, and El Greco (1998), which was an expansion of the former.

Sporting events
The Sport Aid (1986) TV broadcast was set to music specially composed by Vangelis. He conceived and staged the ceremony of the 1997 World Championships in Athletics which were held in Greece. He also composed the music, and designed and directed the artistic Olympic flag relay portion (""Handover to Athens""), of the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. While no official recording of this composition exists, the music can be heard accompanying the presentation of the emblem of the 2004 Athens Games. In 2002, Vangelis created the official Anthem for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. His work from Chariots of Fire was heard during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. His work Conquest of Paradise (1992) (from the movie 1492: Conquest of Paradise) is now the theme song of famous Trail Running competition Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc.

2001–2021: Music projects with NASA and ESA
In 2001, Vangelis performed live, and subsequently released, the choral symphony Mythodea, which was used by NASA as the theme for the Mars Odyssey mission. This is a predominantly orchestral rather than electronic piece that was originally written in 1993. In 2004, Vangelis released the score for Oliver Stone's Alexander, continuing his involvement with projects related to Greece.
Vangelis released two albums in 2007; the first was a 3-CD set for the 25th anniversary of Blade Runner, titled Blade Runner Trilogy and second was the soundtrack for the Greek movie, El Greco directed by Yannis Smaragdis, titled El Greco Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.
On 11 December 2011, Vangelis was invited by Katara Cultural Village in Qatar to conceive, design, direct, and compose music for the opening of its outdoor amphitheater. The event was witnessed by a number of world leaders and dignitaries participating in the 4th Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations held in the city of Doha. British actor Jeremy Irons performed in the role of master of ceremonies, and the event featured a light show by German artist Gert Hof. It was filmed for a future video release by Oscar-winning British filmmaker Hugh Hudson.
In 2012, Vangelis re-tooled and added new pieces to his iconic Chariots of Fire soundtrack, for use in the same-titled stage adaptation. He composed the soundtrack of the environmental documentary film Trashed (2012) directed by Candida Brady and starring Jeremy Irons. A documentary film called Vangelis And The Journey to Ithaka was released in 2013. He also scored the music for the film Twilight of Shadows (2014) directed by Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina.
For the 12 November 2014 landing of the Philae lander on Comet 67P (part of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission), Vangelis composed three short pieces titled ""Arrival"", ""Rosetta's Waltz"", and ""Philae's Journey"". The pieces were released online as videos accompanied by images and animations from the Rosetta mission. He was quoted by ESA as saying, ""Mythology, science and space exploration are subjects that have fascinated me since my early childhood. And they were always connected somehow with the music I write"". In September 2016, the works were released as part of the new studio album Rosetta. In 2018, Vangelis composed an original score for Stephen Hawking's memorial. While Hawking's ashes were interred at Westminster Abbey, the music which backed Hawking's words were beamed by the ESA to the nearest black hole to Earth. It was a personal tribute by Vangelis, and a limited CD titled ""The Stephen Hawking Tribute"" was shared with the family and over 1,000 guests.
On 25 January 2019, a new studio album, Nocturne: The Piano Album, was released which includes both new and old compositions played on a grand piano and were ""inspired by night time, and by Vangelis's long-held passion for space"". However, Vangelis recalled he was kind-of pressured by the record company to release it and include old compositions. In the same year, Vangelis wrote an electro-orchestral score rooted in ethnic music for The Thread, a modern dance piece created by Russell Maliphant inspired by Greek mythology and Hellenic dances. It received very positive reviews, and its CD & DVD was released in a special limited edition by Andromeda Music. On the Maliphant's project he also collaborated with fashion designer Mary Katrantzou for whom composed new music for her fashion shows.
On 24 September 2021, Vangelis released Juno to Jupiter, his last studio album. It was inspired by NASA's Juno spacecraft, featuring the soprano Angela Gheorghiu on several tracks.

Personal life and death
For a musician of his stature, very little is known about Vangelis' personal life; and he rarely gave interviews to journalists.
In 2005, he stated that he was ""never interested"" in the ""decadent lifestyle"" of his band days, choosing not to use alcohol or other drugs. He also had little interest in the music industry business and achieving stardom, realising ""that success and pure creativity are not very compatible. The more successful you become, the more you become a product of something that generates money"". Instead, he used it to be as free and independent as possible and often rejected the opportunity to promote or capitalise on his fame.
Vangelis's place of residence was not publicly known; instead of settling in one place or country, he chose to ""travel around"". He did own a house by the Acropolis of Athens which he did not renovate. Vangelis did not have children; in 2005, he was in his third long-term relationship and said: ""I couldn't take care of a child in the way I think it should be taken care of."" Other interviews mention that Vangelis had been married twice; one of these marriages was to French photographer Veronique Skawinska, who produced work for some of his albums. A 1982 interview with Backstage suggests that Vangelis was previously married to Greek singer Vana Veroutis, who provided vocals for some of his records.
Although a very private person, according to many accounts he was an ""inordinately approachable"", ""really nice"" and ""humorous"" man, who enjoyed long friendly gatherings, was fascinated by Ancient Greek philosophy, the science and physics of music and sound, and space exploration. His daily activities mainly involved combining and playing his electronic instruments and the piano. He also enjoyed painting. His first exhibition, of 70 paintings, was held in 2003 at Almudin in Valencia, Spain. It then toured South America until the end of 2004.
Vangelis died of heart failure on 17 May 2022, at the age of 79, at a hospital in Paris. He was suffering from several health issues in the last couple of years and, according to some reports, died of COVID-19 complications.

Musical style and sensibility
The musical style of Vangelis is diverse; although he primarily used electronic music instruments, which characterize electronic music, his music has been described as a mixture of electronica, classical (his music was often symphonic), progressive rock, jazz (improvisations), ambient, avant-garde/experimental, and world. Vangelis is sometimes categorized as a new-age composer, a classification others have disputed. Vangelis himself called New-age music a style which ""gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music"".
Synthtopia, an electronic music review website, stated that Vangelis's music could be referred to as ""symphonic electronica"" because of his use of synthesizers in an orchestral fashion. The site went on to describe his music as melodic: ""drawing on the melodies of folk music, especially the Greek music of his homeland"". Vangelis's music and compositions have also been described as ""a distinctive sound with simple, repetitive yet memorable tunes against evocative rhythms and chord progressions."" 
In an interview with Soundtrack, a music and film website, Vangelis talked about his compositional processes. For films, Vangelis stated that he would begin composing a score for a feature as soon as he had seen a rough cut of the footage. In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also worked with and conducted orchestras. For example, in the Oliver Stone film Alexander, Vangelis conducted an orchestra that consisted of various classical instruments including sitars, percussion, finger cymbals, harps, and duduks.

He explains his customary method of approach. As soon as the musical idea is there, as many keyboards as possible are connected to the control-desk, which in turn are directly connected to the applicable tracks of the multi-track machine. The idea now is to play as many keyboards as possible at the same time. That way, as broad a basis as possible develops, which only needs fine-tuning. After that it's a question of adding things or leaving out things.
While acknowledging that computers are ""extremely helpful and amazing for a multitude of scientific areas"", he described them as ""insufficient and slow"" for the immediate and spontaneous creation and, in terms of communication, ""the worst thing that has happened for the performing musician"". He considered that contemporary civilization is living in a cultural ""dark age"" of ""musical pollution"". He considered musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to Pythagoreanism. He had a mystical viewpoint on music as ""one of the greatest forces in the universe"", that the ""music exists before we exist"". His experience of music is a kind of synaesthesia.

Instruments and equipment
As a musician who always composed and played primarily on keyboards, Vangelis relied heavily on synthesizers and other electronic approaches to music, although his first instrument was the piano. He also played and used many acoustic and folk instruments when required ) and was a keen percussionist (in additional to a standard drum kit, he performed on vibraphone, timpani, symphonic gongs and snare drums, various gamelan instruments, a tubular bell, a wind gong, a bell tree, and crotales). On several of his albums, he employed a live choir and classical soprano (usually Vana Veroutis). 

I don't always play synthesizers. I play acoustic instruments with the same pleasure. I'm happy when I have unlimited choice; in order to do that, you need everything from simple acoustic sounds to electronic sounds. Sound is sound and vibration is vibration, whether from an electronic source or an acoustic instrument.
Vangelis' first electric keyboard was a Hammond B3 organ, while his first synthesizer was a Korg 700 monophonic. By his own admission, he never got rid of keyboards during the first two decades of his career, but accumulated new ones and simply stopped actively using the old ones once he had effective replacements or had exhausted their possibilities. By the mid-1970s, when based at his Nemo Studio in London, he was also using Elka Tornado IV Reed and Farfisa Syntorchestra organs, a Selmer Clavioline, a Hohner Clavinet D6, a Fender Rhodes 88 electric piano, a GR International Bandmaster Powerhouse 8-track drum machine, a Moog Satellite, and various synthesizers by Roland (SH-1000, SH-2000, and SH-3A) and Korg (MaxiKorg 800DV, MiniKorg 700, and 700s). From the mid-1970s onward he employed two grand pianos - an Imperial Bösendorfer and a Steinway & Sons Concert model. 
Both grand pianos, the Roland SH-3A and the Rhodes 88 were retained for Vangelis' active late 1970s and early 1980s setup, which also featured newer synthesizers by Yamaha (CS-40M and GS-1), ARP Instruments (Pro Soloist, 2500, Odyssey), Oberheim Electronics (TVS-1A, four and eight-voice Polyphonic Synthesizers), Sequential Circuits (Prophet-5 and Prophet-10), Roland (Jupiter-4, ProMars Compuphonic and the modular Systems 101, 102, and 104), a Korg Polyphonic Ensemble, an RSF Kobol Black Box, and a MiniMoog. Other studio equipment during this period included the Solina String Ensemble and EKO Stradivarius string synthesizers; sequencers by ARP, Roland (CSQ-100 and CSQ-600), and Oberheim (DS-2); drum machines by Simmons (SDS-V), Korg (KR-55, Mini Pops 120), Roland (CR-5000 Compurhythm), and Linn (LM-1); vocoders by EMS (Vocoder 1000) and Roland (VP-330 VocoderPlus Mk. I); and the Dubrecq Stylophone 350S. Vangelis also added a Crumar Compac-piano and a Yamaha CP-80 to his piano set-up.
For the mid-1980s, Vangelis retained his Roland modular systems and ProMars Compuphonic synthesizers, but added the SH-101 and JX8-P models, and the MKS-80 Super Jupiter rack mount module, as well as a Yamaha GS-1. Other holdovers from previous active setups were the Fender Rhodes 88 and Yamaha CP-80, the MiniMoog, the Prophet-10, and the grand pianos. For drum machines, he retained the Linn LM-1 but added an LM-2 LinnDrum and an E-mu SP-12; his chosen sequencers for this period were the Roland CSQ-600 and the ARP; and he upgraded to the Mk. II version of the Roland VP-330 VocoderPlus. Vangelis disliked programming-oriented sampling devices like the Fairlight CMI (considering them to be too far removed from being relatable instruments) and remained unimpressed by many of the later commercial 1980s polysynths such as the Yamaha DX7; however, he did use the E-mu Emulator sampler, in particular the Emulator II model.  
Vangelis' favourite keyboard was the Yamaha CS-80 polyphonic synthesizer, which he began using from 1977 and which allowed him to employ a distinctive and expressive vibrato technique by varying the pressure exerted on the key. He would use this instrument throughout the 1970s and 1980s to the point that its timbres, abilities, and idiosyncrasies became closely associated with his musical signature. In a 1984 interview, Vangelis described the CS-80 as ""the most important synthesizer in my career – and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been...  It needs a lot of practice if you want to be able to play it properly, but that's because it's the only synthesizer I could describe as being a real instrument, mainly because of the keyboard — the way it's built and what you can do with it.""  
For his final period at Nemo in the late 1980s, Vangelis also retained the Emulator II; the Prophet 10 (enhanced by the VS module); the GS-1, his grand pianos, and the CP-80 in active service along with the Roland ProMars Compuphonic, JX8-P, and VP-330 VocoderPlus (while mostly retiring the Fender Rhodes). He would also continue to use the SP-12 and LinnDrum as drum machines, adding the Sequential Circuits TOM. By this point, the Roland modular systems had also been retired, although he would retain the MKS-80 Super Jupiter and augment it with further MKS-20 and MKS-70 rack mount models as well as two further Roland keyboard synthesizers (the Jupiter-6 and the Juno-106). During this time, Vangelis also made a return to Korg keyboards (acquiring a DW-8000 and a Poly-800) as well as adding the Ensoniq Mirage to his sampler armoury. Sequencing was now handled by a Roland MSQ-700. Despite his stated disappointment with the Yamaha DX7, he still used it alongside the related modular TX7 version.
In 1988, Vangelis closed Nemo Studio and embarked on the more nomadic lifestyle he would continue for the rest of his life, moving between homes and hotels in different countries according to whim and circumstance. For this, he made a drastic switch to a portable, all-digital instrumental setup based around the Zyklus MIDI Performance System, which was first heard on his 1988 album Direct.
For the last part of his career, Vangelis used a custom keyboard set-up with built-in volume and mixing pedal controls, enabling him to improvise, play, arrange, and orchestrate his music live without overdubbing or needing to move from one sitting position. This ensemble, and the set-up he used for his irregular concert performances, appeared to be based around various Korg and Roland machines as well as the E-mu Proteus rack module.

Honours and legacy
In 1989 Vangelis received the Max Steiner Award. France made him a Knight of the Order of the Arts and Letters in 1992 and promoted him to Commander in 2017, as well as Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour in 2001. In 1993 he received the music award Apollo by Friends of the Athens National Opera Society. In 1995, Vangelis had a minor planet named after him (6354 Vangelis) by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the name was proposed by the MPC's co-director, Gareth V. Williams, rather than by the object's original discoverer, Eugène Joseph Delporte, who died in 1955, long before the 1934 discovery could be confirmed by observations made in 1990. In 1996 and 1997, Vangelis received awards at the World Music Awards.
NASA conferred their Public Service Medal to Vangelis in 2003. The award is the highest honour the space agency presents to an individual not involved with the American government. Five years later, in 2008, the board of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens voted to award Vangelis an honorary doctoral degree, making him a professor emeritus at their Faculty of Primary Education. In June 2008, the American Hellenic Institute honoured Vangelis with an AHI Hellenic Heritage Achievement Award for his ""exceptional artistic achievements"" as a pioneer in electronic music and for his lifelong dedication to the promotion of Hellenism through the arts. On 16 September 2013, he received the honour of appearing on the Greek 80 cent postage stamp, as part of a series of six distinguished living personalities of the Greek Diaspora. In May 2018 the University of Thessaly in Vangelis's hometown of Volos awarded him an honorary doctorate degree in electrical and computer engineering.
The American Film Institute nominated Vangelis's scores for Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire for their list of the 25 greatest film scores.

Interview with Vangelis on composing Chariots of Fire from BBC Four's Sound of Cinema"
Vidna Obmana,"Vidna Obmana (stylized vidnaObmana on many album covers) is a pseudonym used by Belgian composer and ambient musician Dirk Serries. The name Vidna Obmana, a phrase in Serbian, literally translates to ""optical illusion"" and was chosen by Serries because he felt it accurately described the music. Serries created music under the Vidna Obmana pseudonym from 1984 until 2007, when he officially retired the name. Most of his current work is released under the Fear Falls Burning pseudonym.
Vidna Obmana's music has often been described as anamorphic and organic. He uses the techniques of looping and shaping harmonies, minimizing the configurations to a few notes.
Vidna Obmana has collaborated on several occasions with artists such as Asmus Tietchens, Brannan Lane, Capriolo Trifoglio, Diego Borotti, and Steve Roach. Some of these collaborations have become entire projects of their own, such as Continuum (collaboration with Bass Communion) and Principle of Silence (collaboration with Joris De Backer).
Vidna Obmana is often cited as one of the more notable dark ambient musicians.

Voice of Eye,"Voice of Eye is a Taos, New Mexico based experimental ambient music duo whose members are Bonnie McNaim and Jim Wilson. Formed in 1989 in Houston, Texas, their sound is one that blends electronic soundscapes, dark ambient, drone, and world music, particularly with Middle Eastern overtones, and tends to evoke an atmospheric or shamanistic quality. Many of the instruments used are home-made or heavily modified. Using this ""odd palette of instrumentation,"" their music has been described as ""largely indescribable, but totally inviting.""
A ten-year musical hiatus began in 1997 as the duo shifted their focus from music to building an off-the-grid sustainable earthship and studio in New Mexico. They returned to touring and recording music in 2007.

History
Bonnie McNairn and Jim Wilson first began performing together in the experimental band Cruor with Ure Thrall and Tim Sternat in 1988. Ure Thrall and Jim Wilson originally formed Cruor in 1987 with a revolving lineup of members based on who had a PA system. Following the crucifixion of Ure Thrall, Sternat, Wilson and McNairn formed Esoterica Landscapes 7. This was an industrial noise band based around the embrace of chaos and ""majik"". Eventually the embrace of these elements took its toll and Voice of Eye was formed as a vehicle to explore profound aspects of consciousness using music as a shared tool for entering different states of being. “The motivation behind forming Voice of Eye was for us to connect to a deeper truth we first sensed within our music. This unformed presence first revealed itself to us through music and has continued to manifest, taking shape throughout our life’s journey and leading to profound mystery.”

Method
Voice of Eye process real-time acoustic events through electronic devices and digital manipulation to achieve their signature sonic atmospheres. They invent and construct many of the instruments heard on their recordings. The use of non-traditional, found, misappropriated, primal, and world instruments also play a prominent role in their music.
McNairn and Wilson feel that the physical translation of movement and breath into sound cannot be equaled. “To literally touch the vibration, to feel it in your body, is a magical feedback to the source of all sound, the timeless vibration of the Universe.”

Wally Badarou,"Waliou Jacques Daniel Isheola ""Wally"" Badarou (born 22 March 1955) is a French musician. Born in France with ancestry from Benin, West Africa, Badarou is known for his close association with the English group Level 42, and for his prolific work as a session musician with a wide variety of performers from around the world.

Biography
Badarou was the long-time associate of the British band Level 42, contributing on keyboards, synthesizers and programming. He has co-written and performed on a number of the band's tracks since their recording début in 1980, later co-producing them.
Though never an official member of Level 42, he could be considered a de facto ""fifth member"" of the band's classic line-up from 1980 through 1994, as he played keyboards and synths on all their studio albums, and co-wrote and/or co-produced much of their material.  However, Badarou did not play with Level 42 on concert dates, and he has not been involved with the revived version of the group, which reunited in the early 2000s.
Badarou was close to Island Records's founder Chris Blackwell, and he was one of the Compass Point All Stars (with Sly and Robbie, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung and Uziah ""Sticky"" Thompson), the in-house recording team of Compass Point Studios responsible for a long series of albums of the 1980s recorded by Grace Jones, Tom Tom Club, Joe Cocker, Mick Jagger, Black Uhuru, Gwen Guthrie, Jimmy Cliff and Gregory Isaacs.
Badarou's keyboard playing could also be heard on albums by Robert Palmer, Marianne Faithfull, Herbie Hancock, M (Pop Muzik), Talking Heads, Foreigner, Power Station, Melissa Etheridge, Manu Dibango and Miriam Makeba.
He produced albums by Fela Kuti, Salif Keita, Wasis Diop, Trilok Gurtu, Carlinhos Brown; wrote for the films Countryman, and Kiss of the Spider Woman; plus directed and wrote for Jean-Paul Goude's French Bicentennial parade, Bastille Day 1989.
His solo instrumental work includes two albums: Echoes (1984) and Words of a Mountain (1989). The former included ""Chief Inspector"", ""Mambo"" (sampled for Massive Attack's ""Daydreaming"" (Blue Lines  album)), and ""Hi-Life"". ""Chief Inspector"" peaked at #46 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1985.
The Words of a Mountain album is believed to be one of the first fully tapeless recordings in contemporary/new-age history: co-pioneering the computerised home studio concept with other electronic musicians of his generation, Badarou established a reputation on the field with his extensive use of Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, New England Digital Synclavier, and custom voice-controlled Yamaha digital mixers.
Badarou also helped organise the Kora All Africa Music Awards in 1997, while co-writing and producing So Why, a charity album for the ICRC, conceived as a call against ethnic cleansing in Africa, featuring Youssou N'Dour and Papa Wemba.
He has embraced stage acting since the early 2000s, showing interest in aviation, movies, science-fiction and philosophy.
By the end of 2009, starting with Fisherman, a 15 mn long ""marathon in afro-beat territory "", Badarou released his latest album (The Unnamed Trilogy): online exclusively, one single at a time, via the JukeSticker, a direct and sharable transaction tool: ""At very long last, my fans are to receive the music that never stopped haunting me all these years. The whole of it will be available as a physical collector set, once the three albums are fully revealed "".

Wally Badarou RBMA video lecture session"
Wendy Carlos,"Wendy Carlos (born Walter Carlos, November 14, 1939) is an American musician and composer best known for her electronic music and film scores.
Born and raised in Rhode Island, Carlos studied physics and music at Brown University before moving to New York City in 1962 to study music composition at Columbia University. Studying and working with various electronic musicians and technicians at the city's Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, she helped in the development of the Moog synthesizer, Robert Moog's first commercially available keyboard instrument.
Carlos came to prominence with Switched-On Bach (1968), an album of music by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer, which helped popularize its use in the 1970s and won her three Grammy Awards. Its commercial success led to several more albums, including further synthesized classical music adaptations, and experimental and ambient music. She composed the score to two Stanley Kubrick films, A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining (1980), and for Tron (1982) for Walt Disney Productions.
In 1979, Carlos raised public awareness of transgender issues by disclosing she had been living as a woman since at least 1968, and in 1972 had undergone sex reassignment surgery.
As of 2020, much of Carlos's discography is out of print, and has not been licensed for digital distribution to streaming or download platforms.

Early life
Carlos was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the first of two children born to working-class parents. Her mother played the piano and sang; one uncle played the trombone and another played the trumpet and drums. She began piano lessons at age six, and wrote her first composition, ""A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano"", at age ten.
Carlos attended St. Raphael Academy, a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship by building a computer presented at the Westinghouse Science Fair, a science competition for high-school students. From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at Brown University and graduated with a degree in music and physics, during which she taught lessons in electronic music at informal sessions.

Career
1960s
In 1965, Carlos graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in music composition, and assisted Leonard Bernstein in presenting an evening of electronic music at the Philharmonic Hall. Carlos studied with Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s. They were based in the Columbia–Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, the first of its kind in the United States. After Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support herself, Carlos began working as a recording and mastering engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City; she worked in this position until 1968. She called it ""a really lovely occupation"" and found it a useful learning experience.
During her time at Columbia, Carlos met Robert Moog at the 1964 Audio Engineering Society show, which began a partnership. Carlos ordered custom-designed synthesizer modules from Moog, and gave him extensive advice and technical assistance in the development of what became the Moog synthesizer, Moog's new electronic instrument. She convinced Moog to add a touch-sensitive keyboard for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements. Moog recounted that Carlos fed back extensive and very detailed—but always constructive—criticism about his equipment, presenting him with suggestions for improvements to every module, including the shapes and dimensions of the cases. Moog credited Carlos with originating many features of his synthesizer, and that many features that became part of the final production model of the Moog synthesizer originated with the custom modules he created for her, including the touch-sensitive keyboard, a portamento control, a fixed filter bank, and a 49-oscillator polyphonic generator bank that could create chords and arpeggios.
By 1966 Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer, which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her ""anywhere from $100 to $1000"". In 1967, Carlos met and befriended fellow Gotham Recorders employee Rachel Elkind, a former singer who had a jazz and musical theatre background and had worked as a secretary for Goddard Lieberson, then-president of Columbia Records. Although their initial meetings were somewhat confrontational (Elkind initially found Carlos ""arrogant""), they eventually became friends and began sharing a home, studio, and business premises in a brownstone building in the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.
Carlos recorded several compositions in the 1960s as a student at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Two of them were re-recorded and released on By Request (1975), Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers (1963) and Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound (1964), both featuring Phillip Ramey on piano. A third, Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds (1964, featuring John Heiss on flute) was recorded and released in 1965 on a Turnabout Records ""Electronic Music"" compilation. Other known, but unreleased student compositions include ""Episodes for Piano and Tape"" (1964), ""Pomposities for Narrator and Tape"" (1965), and ""Noah"" (1965), a two-hour opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Carlos's first commercial release was Moog 900 Series – Electronic Music Systems (1967), an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog synthesizer released as a nine-minute single-sided mono LP and narrated by Ed Stokes.
Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment, and in part payment for her various other contributions to Moog's product development, and for articles she wrote for his short-lived electronic music periodical, she was able to acquire additional Moog equipment at a discount, most of it custom-designed to her specific requirements. By the time Carlos began recording Switched On Bach she had built a home studio valued at around US$12,000 (approx. $100,000 in 2023) (although, given the unique nature of most of the modules, and their provenance, the 2023 value of her studio equipment would likely be far higher).
Her home studio, crucially, included an eight-track recorder that Carlos had built herself (because she was unable to afford a factory-made machine), using parts from Ampex and EMI recorders, with the addition of Ampex's patented ""Sel-Sync"" system, which enabled recorded signals to be monitored via the record head, rather than the playback head, thus permitting multiple tracks to be kept in perfect synchronisation. Carlos was also one of the earliest adopters of the Dolby noise reduction system, which she used for her final two-track masters.

Switched-On Bach
In 1968, Carlos released Switched-On Bach, an album formed of several pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. Carlos had originally wanted to record an album of her own music, but Elkind suggested that they use music that was more familiar to the general listener in order to introduce the synthesizer as a credible new instrument. The idea for an album of Bach's music performed on the Moog began to crystallize during 1967, after Carlos asked Elkind to listen to some recordings by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman made up to ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center, one of them being Bach's Two-Part Invention in F major, which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach compositions developed from there.
From her experience working in the music industry, Elkind knew that a major label would be unlikely to accept a pitch from a woman, so she approached her friend, the musician, conductor and producer Ettore Stratta, who was then a producer working in the A&R division at Columbia Records. He successfully pitched the project to the label on their behalf, leading to a two-album recording contract with Columbia Masterworks, a deal that lasted until 1986. Crucially, it gave Carlos and Elkind ownership of their recording masters, and Elkind was able to negotiate what she described as ""a very nice royalty"", possibly because the label did not have to invest a large sum up-front, and did not expect that the album would sell many copies.
Columbia had launched an album sales campaign named ""Bach to Rock"", though it had no album of Bach's works in a contemporary context in its catalogue. They were given a small advance from the label; Elkind recalled they were offered $1000, Carlos told an interviewer they were given about $2500, a relatively modest sum, given that the average recording budget for a major pop album at this time was about $10,000. Columbia granted Carlos and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman and with Elkind as producer.
The recording process was long and complex, because the monophonic Moog could only play one note at a time. Due to the limitations of her equipment, every instrumental part in each score had to be recorded separately, and then each successive part was layered over the previously recorded parts on Carlos' eight-track recorder. All the parts were coordinated by recording each one in time with a click track, which was eventually erased. Biographer Amanda Sewell reports that Carlos only rarely wrote down the complex combination of control knob settings and cable connections (or ""patches"") used to create specific sounds on the Moog, and that she was able to memorize and recall nearly her entire ""library"" of patches at will.
This tortuous recording process was made even more difficult by the tendency of the early Moog oscillators to drift out of tune—by her own account, Carlos was often only able to record one or two measures of each part before the Moog went out of tune, and she claimed she sometimes even had to bang on the casing with a hammer to get it back into tune. This issue also meant that she had to meticulously review each segment for consistency once it had been recorded, because if one line was out of tune the entire section would be ruined.
Carlos later recalled that she worked on the recording of the album for eight hours a day, five days a week, for five months, on top of her regular 40-hour-per-week day job at Gotham Studios. Although Switched-On Bach was extremely costly in terms of person-hours expended, her high-quality home studio, her proficiency as a programmer and performer on the Moog, and her ability as a recording engineer enabled Carlos and her colleagues to record and produce the album completely independently, thereby avoiding the need to use expensive commercial recording studios. As well as the consideration that repeatedly taking the bulky, complex and delicate Moog system to and from a studio for each session would have been almost impossible, given Carlos' own reckoning that the project took over 1100 hours to complete, using commercial studios would have made the recording prohibitively expensive, and would likely have cost upwards of US$100,000 in 1968. By comparison, The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band took over 700 hours to record and cost a reported UK£25,000, or about US$60,000 at the 1968 exchange rate. Additionally, although the recording was extremely labour-intensive, the combination of the Moog and the multitrack recorder gave Carlos and Elkind unprecedented control over every facet of the timbral, expressive and environmental qualities of every single note they recorded, enabling them to create a new level of clarity for each ""voice"" in the compositions—a key concern for Elkind, who was critical of what she called the ""soggy"" audio quality of contemporary classical recordings.
Released in October 1968, Switched-On Bach became an unexpected commercial and critical hit, with Glenn Gould calling it ""the album of the decade"", and it helped to draw attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program in November 1968, called CBC AM, secured a rare interview with Walter Carlos about the selection and use of Moog. Biographer Amanda Sewell observes, it is notable that Carlos is not pictured anywhere on the album, and is only mentioned by name (as Walter Carlos) in the rear sleeve notes of the original cover. Newsweek dedicated a full page to Carlos with the caption ""Plugging into the Steinway of the future"". It peaked at No. 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was No. 1 on its Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It was the second classical album to sell over one million copies and was certified Gold in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Carlos performed selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.
The massive and unexpected success of Switched-On Bach put great pressure on Carlos. She was by this time well into her gender confirmation process, and she was fearful of both personal ridicule and physical attack, and of the negative impact that her status as a transitioning person could have on her music career. Biographer Amanda Sewell records that the St. Louis appearance was extremely difficult for her—she hated having to disguise herself as Walter, for which she had to affect a deeper voice, use makeup to simulate a five o'clock shadow, and don a wig and pasted-on fake sideburns. Her childhood experiences of being bullied and assaulted made her so fearful of appearing in public that she reportedly even contemplated taking her own life before the event and cried all the way to St. Louis.
This was to be one of only two live performances Carlos made following her days as a student, the other being with the Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for ""Bach at the Beacon"" in 1997.
In 1970, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. Carlos released a follow-up, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the Billboard 200 and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind's more spacious New York City home in 1971.
Carlos considers Elkind's contribution to her work, and specifically Switched-On Bach, to be underappreciated, calling her ""a 'silent' partner"" and her work ""critical to my success"".

1970s
After the release of Switched-On Bach, Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, Marooned (1969), directed by John Sturges, and A Clockwork Orange (1971), directed by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of Marooned changed their minds about including a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: ""We finally wound up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London."" Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named ""Timesteps"". A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. The album peaked on the Billboard 200 chart at No. 146. Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange. Carlos later described the project as ""a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture"".
Carlos experimented with ambient music on her third studio album Sonic Seasonings, released as a double album in 1972, with one side-long track dedicated to each of the four seasons. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the A Clockwork Orange project was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require ""lengthy concentrated listening"", but more than a collection of ambient noises to portray an environment. It combined field recordings of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing melodies, to create soundscapes. It reached No. 168 in the Billboard 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and new-age genres in later years.
By 1973, Columbia/CBS Records had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to Switched-On Bach, which began with her and Elkind seeking compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from Suite No. 2 in B minor, Two-Part Inventions in A minor and major, Suite from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, and Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major. The latter features a Yamaha E-5 Electone organ for certain passages, as a reliable polyphonic keyboard had not been developed. The result, Switched-On Bach II, was released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.
Following Switched-On Bach II, Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind had asked Columbia Records to attach a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases. The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos's original compositions. Carlos decided, ""If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music"", and so began a process of ""re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones"". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos's compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of ""Eleanor Rigby"" by The Beatles and ""What's New Pussycat?"", originally sung by Tom Jones. The latter track, featuring some 40 tracks of overdubbed synthesiser, was one of the pieces that Carlos had unsuccessfully presented to Elkind in 1967 when they were planning what became Switched-On Bach. The final track, entitled ""Pompous Circumstances"", a ""witty and serious"" set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar (see ""Pomp and Circumstance""), was replaced by CBS with tracks from The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in this style, which ""devastated"" Carlos. Between 1974 and 1980 she scored several short films for producer Dick Young for UNICEF (seven of which were released in 2005 on Rediscovering Lost Scores, Vol.1).
By Request was followed by Switched-On Brandenburgs, a double album containing all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos played on a synthesizer, in 1980.

1980s
Carlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film The Shining (1980). Before filming began, Carlos and Elkind read the book, as per Kubrick's suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a complete electronic score for the film, but Kubrick ended up using mostly existing recordings by several avant-garde composers, tracks that he had used as guide tracks during editing. Carlos and Elkind did not discover this until they were invited to a screening of the film in May 1980, and they were reportedly furious about Kubrick's actions. Their experience closely mirrored that of composer Alex North, who had written and recorded a complete orchestral soundtrack for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but discovered at the film's world premiere that Kubrick had jettisoned the entire score in favour of the guide tracks he had used while editing the movie.
The Shining (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), released in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records, featured only two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the main title theme and ""Rocky Mountains"", the former a reinterpretation of the ""Dies Irae"" section of Symphonie fantastique by Hector Berlioz. Biographer Amanda Sewell discovered that Carlos and Elkind's agent Lucy Kroll had written a note in her files indicating that the duo had initially considered suing Kubrick, but Sewell found that, several pages further on, Kroll had written another note that read ""No signed contract""—Carlos and Elkind had made the deal with Kubrick ""on a handshake"", and thus had no legal recourse. Some of Carlos's music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her two-volume compilation album Rediscovering Lost Scores.
With work on The Shining complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to France with her husband in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in Greenwich Village with her new business partner Annemarie Franklin. It housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a Faraday cage to shield the equipment from white noise and outside interference from radio and television signals.
Carlos's first project with Franklin began around 1980, when The Walt Disney Company asked her to record the soundtrack to its science fiction feature Tron (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were ""tightly specified ... there wasn't a lot of elbow room, and that made it fun"". The score incorporated Carlos's analog and digital synthesizers with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the UCLA Chorus, and the Royal Albert Hall Organ. Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the Billboard 200. Carlos intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.
Three studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was Digital Moonscapes in 1984, Carlos's first to only feature digital synthesizers. She wrote the album's tracks for orchestra ""or orchestra replica"", inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used some leftover material from her score to Tron. Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to ""get away from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years"". In 1986, Audion released Beauty in the Beast, which saw Carlos experiment with just intonation, Balinese scales, and four new microtonal scales she devised for the album: harmonic, alpha, beta, and gamma. The album features the first instance of a 35-note octave. Carlos considers the album as the most important of her career. She followed the album with Secrets of Synthesis in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums.
In 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to release a parody of Peter and the Wolf by Sergei Prokofiev. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance ""to let your sense of humor out of the cage"". Yankovic adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a ""MIDI orchestra"", her first venture using the digital interface. The album's second side also contains a humorous adaptation of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns titled ""The Carnival of the Animals—Part II"", with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet Ogden Nash, who did similar for the original. Released in October 1988, Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals—Part II was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children in 1989.

1990s–2000s
To mark the 25th anniversary of Switched-On Bach, Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording techniques. Released in 1992 on Telarc Records, Switched-On Bach 2000 took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several digital audio workstation software packages, including Pro Tools. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers. The album also marked her first venture into mixing in Dolby Surround sound.
Carlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film Brand New World (1998), also known as Woundings, directed by Roberta Hanley and based on a play by Jeff Noon. Carlos explained the style of her music: ""I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that's what the film became"".
In 1998, Carlos released her most recent studio album, Tales from Heaven and Hell, for the East Side Digital label.
Beginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the Switched-On Box Set released in 1999 featuring her four synthesized classical albums.
In 2005, the two-volume set Rediscovering Lost Scores was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the unreleased soundtrack to Woundings and music recorded for A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Tron that was not used in the films.

Personal life
Gender transition
Carlos became aware of her gender dysphoria at an early age, recalling: ""I was about five or six ... I remember being convinced I was a little girl, much preferring long hair and girls' clothes, and not knowing why my parents didn't see it clearly"". While at Brown, she went on a date with a girl and felt ""so jealous of her I was beside myself"".
Sometime after entering graduate school at Columbia University in the fall of 1962, she encountered studies of transgender issues for the first time, which explained to her what she was feeling. In the summer of 1966, New York sexologist and pioneering transgender advocate Harry Benjamin published his landmark book The Transsexual Phenomenon, and, in the fall of 1967, Carlos began counseling with him (well before Switched-On Bach).
By early 1968, Carlos had begun hormone replacement treatment under Benjamin's care, which began altering her appearance. That created some problems for Carlos when Switched-On Bach became an unexpected hit after its release in October 1968.
Prior to a live performance of excerpts from the album with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Carlos felt terrified about appearing in public. She cried in her hotel room, before putting on fake sideburns and a man's wig, and drawing on facial hair with an eyebrow pencil to appear more masculine. She did the same thing again when she met Kubrick, and for an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show in 1970.
Finally, the commercial success of Switched-On Bach allowed Carlos the funds to undergo sex reassignment surgery in May 1972, although for marketing reasons she released two more albums as Walter Carlos (1973's Switched-On Bach II and 1975's By Request).
Carlos disclosed her transgender status in a series of interviews with Arthur Bell held between December 1978 and January 1979, published in the May 1979 issue of Playboy magazine. She explained in Playboy that she had ""always been concerned with liberation, and [I was] anxious to liberate myself"". In 1985, Carlos spoke about the reaction to her transition: ""The public turned out to be amazingly tolerant or, if you wish, indifferent ... There had never been any need of this charade to have taken place. It had proven a monstrous waste of years of my life.""
The first album released after the Playboy interview, Switched-On Brandenburgs (1980), and all subsequent releases and re-releases, have been issued under the name Wendy Carlos.

Lawsuit
In 1998, Carlos sued the songwriter/artist Momus for $22 million regarding the song ""Walter Carlos"" (from the album The Little Red Songbook, released that year), which postulated that after the sex reassignment surgery Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-transition self, Walter. The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees.

Published biography
A biography by musicologist Amanda Sewell, Wendy Carlos: A Biography, was published by Oxford University Press in 2020. Although the author was unable to secure on-the-record interviews with the artist or anyone close to her, it was positively received by critics. On her personal website, Carlos describes the work as ""fiction"" that mischaracterizes her life and deceased parents.

Awards and honors
Switched-On Bach was the winner of three Grammy Awards at the 1970 ceremony:

Album of the Year, Classical
Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist Or Soloists (With Or Without Orchestra)
Best Engineered Recording, Classical
Carlos received three additional nominations for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist Or Soloists (With Or Without Orchestra) and Best Engineered Recording, Classical for The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, and Best Recording for Children for Peter And The Wolf/Carnival Of The Animals (Part II).
In 2005, Carlos was the recipient of the SEAMUS Lifetime Achievement Award ""in recognition of lifetime achievement and contribution to the art and craft of electro-acoustic music"" by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States.
Carlos is the first transgender recipient of a Grammy Award.

Other activities
Carlos contributed a review of the then-available synthesizers to the June 1971 edition of the Whole Earth Catalog, contrasting the Moog, Buchla and Tonus (aka ARP) systems. She was dismissive of smaller systems like the EMS Putney and the Minimoog as ""toys"" and ""cash-ins"".
Carlos is also an accomplished solar eclipse photographer. Her work has been published online by NASA and has appeared on the cover of Sky & Telescope. She has developed various techniques for the extension of dynamic range in eclipse photography by the use of darkroom techniques and digital composites.

William Orbit,"William Mark Wainwright (born 15 December 1956), known professionally as William Orbit, is an English musician and record producer who has sold 200 million recordings worldwide of his own work, his production and song-writing work. He is a recipient of multiple Grammy Awards, Ivor Novello Awards and other music industry awards.

Early life
Orbit (Wainwright) was raised in Palmers Green, a suburb of London. His parents were both schoolteachers; he was the elder of two sons. He left school at the age of 16, and subsisted for a number of years in various low-paying jobs, while seeking an outlet for his creativity. Around this time, while rooming with a friend who was trying to start a recording studio, Orbit found his musical calling.

Torch Song and Bassomatic
In 1980, Orbit teamed up with electronic musician Laurie Mayer and Grant Gilbert to form the electronic/synth group Torch Song. They initially self-released recordings in an audio cassette series, generated from their home-built studio in a squatted disused school, nicknamed the Centro Iberico, located in Notting Hill Gate, in London, alongside the Grand Union Canal. Richard Law, who was A&R for IRS Records, was a follower of their music and aesthetic; in 1981, Law took it to Miles Copeland, who had discovered and managed the Police and the Bangles. When Copeland signed them to the label, the deal enabled them to build their ideal studio. There they recorded two albums and four singles, the most successful being the dance chart hit ""Prepare to Energize"", which was featured in the film Bachelor Party. Orbit and Mayer also composed the soundtrack to the ice hockey movie Youngblood, starring Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze, and recorded ""White Night"", written by colleague Rico Conning, which was used in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. The band reunited briefly when Orbit worked with Laurie Mayer and Rico Conning. They released their final album, Toward the Unknown Region in 1995.
This first incarnation of Guerilla Studios had a Trident 80B mixing desk and Otari MTR90 MKII 24 track (2 inch tape) multitrack housed in a back garden on the canals of Little Venice in Paddington, and they also ran it as a commercial enterprise.
Bassomatic was another of Orbit's group projects. The band recorded house music in the 1990s.  The band included vocalist Sharon Musgrave and rapper Steve Roberts, also known as MC Inna Onestep amongst others. For the second album, singer Sindy Finn replaced Musgrave on vocals. Both albums were released by Guerilla Studios, founded by Orbit with Laurie Mayer and Grant Gilbert.
Bassomatic's first album was 1990's Set the Controls for the Heart of the Bass, the title track derived from Pink Floyd's ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"". This album was re-released in 1997. A subsequent album, Science and Melody, was released in 1991.
Bassomatic's biggest hit single was ""Fascinating Rhythm"" in 1990, which reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart, and performed well on the UK Dance Chart.
Around this time, Orbit's studio chiefly consisted of a pair of Akai S1000 samplers and a Roland Juno-106 synthesiser.

Productions and remixes
Collaborations and productions included Prince, Belinda Carlisle, Madonna, Britney Spears, Mel C, Pink, U2, Katie Melua, Ricky Martin, Beth Orton, Sarah McLachlan, Queen, The Joy Formidable, Robbie Williams, All Saints, Kraftwerk, Harry Enfield and Sugababes. When working with Beck, the two of them wrote a song for Pink, ""Feel Good Time,"" which Orbit then produced for the soundtrack for the 2003 film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.
He produced the album 13 by Britpop group Blur, in London and Reykjavík, Iceland.
Orbit had created remixes for Madonna previously such as those of ""Justify My Love"" and ""Erotica"" but did not meet her personally until 1997. That summer and autumn, they worked together and produced her multi-Grammy/award-winning seventh album Ray of Light. The album took four months to record and it was the longest she ever spent recording an album. It was released on 22 February 1998.
In 2000, Orbit continued working for Madonna on her album Music, recorded at The Hit Factory in New York.
At this time, he also co-wrote and performed with her on the song ""Beautiful Stranger"". 
In 2011, he worked with a team of writers including  Jean-Baptiste Kouame, Julie Frost and Klas Ahlund and brought their compositions and his production work to contribute to the twelfth studio album by Madonna, MDNA, released on 23 March 2012, by Interscope Records. He co-produced 6 tracks on the album, including ""Masterpiece"" which won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song in the Miramax film W.E., at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. After the release of the album, Orbit openly expressed in various media sources his dissatisfaction and disappointment with this Madonna project.
In 2013, Orbit worked with Britney Spears and will.i.am on the album Britney Jean, with fellow songwriters Ana Diaz and Dan Traynor with whom he wrote and produced the track ""Alien"". 
He was one of the writers and one of the producers on the Chris Brown song ""Don't Wake Me Up"" which was recorded at Record Plant in LA and for which he received an ASCAP award in 2013.
This was followed by a production of the Queen track ""There Must Be More to Life Than This"", which featured archive vocals by Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson.  Orbit went on to produce another Queen song, ""Let Me in Your Heart Again"".
In 2015, his composition ""The Name of the Wave"" was used in the Oscar winning documentary Amy directed by Asif Kapadia.
In 2018, he worked on ""After All"", a song by English-Canadian girl group All Saints from their fifth studio album, Testament (2018). Written by group member Shaznay Lewis along with Peter Hutchings and Orbit, whilst produced by the latter, it was released as the album's second single on 26 July 2018.

Classical work
Inspired and encouraged by Rob Dickins, Orbit's first commercial release in the classical sphere was Pieces in a Modern Style. It was originally released in May 1995 on Orbit's N-Gram Recordings label, and then again in 2000 by Warner Music in the UK and Europe, and on Maverick in the U.S. The album reached No 2 in the UK album charts. The first single release from the album was ""Barber’s Adagio for Strings"", and a trance remix of the track by Dutch DJ Ferry Corsten was hugely successful. The single reached number 4 in the national singles chart. In 2010 he teamed with Rico Conning and Laurie Mayer to make a follow-up album, Pieces in a Modern Style 2, which was released as a two-disc set on the Decca label. The album featured German countertenor Andreas Scholl on an interpretation of Henry Purcell's ""Dido’s Lament"".
In 2007, he took part in Alex Poots’ Manchester International Festival, and composed a symphonic work in nine movements, ""Orchestral Suite"" which was performed by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, augmented by additional harps, pianos and percussion, and with The Manchester Chorale, conducted by Alexander Shelley at Bridgewater Hall.

Live performance/media/DJ work
In the early '90s, Orbit briefly developed a new label which he called N'Gram.  During the N'Gram period, he co-directed a showcase of the label at Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's Southbank. The acts included The Electric Chamber (which performed the Pieces album), Strange Cargo, and Torch Song.
In 2001, he took part in the Stockhausen Electronic Festival at the Barbican Theatre.
In 2013, he took part in the London Electronic Arts Festival.
He participated in the Liberatum International Cultural Festival in Russia, during which he performed DJ sets in Moscow and Novosibirsk, Siberia.
He performed in 2015 in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and at a gala at Banqueting House in London's Whitehall for the charity Together for Short Lives, a group that sponsors and supports children with terminal illnesses and their families. Orbit has deejayed at various clubs in London and Ibiza, and at Buckingham Palace for Her Majesty The Queen's annual staff and family Christmas party, in 2015.
Orbit joined Hawkwind on stage on 29 September 2023 at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their Space Ritual album.

Windy & Carl,"Windy & Carl is an American ambient duo based in Dearborn, Michigan, United States.

Overview
Cited as ""a leading light of the Michigan space-rock scene"" by AllMusic, the minimalist group formed in 1993 around the core husband-and-wife duo of guitarist Carl Hultgren and bassist/singer Windy Weber. (Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.)  The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years.
The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts.
Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers.  Another noteworthy aspect of W&C's sound is the absence of drums.

History
""Hultgren first began recording instrumental guitar drone pieces in 1992, when he self-released a cassette tape named Portal before teaming up with Weber"". It was later reissued on CD by BaDaBing owner Ben Goldberg.  
Windy & Carl then participated in Darla Records' Bliss Out Series in 1997, contributing the maxi-EP Antarctica.  That year, they also issued the limited-edition album/maxi-EP A Dream of Blue on U.K. label Ochre Records, with individually painted cover art by Weber (on the 10"" vinyl version). Depths was released by Kranky in early 1998.
In 1999, the couple teamed up with synthesist Greg Gasiorowski to record under the name Five Way Mirror. They released a few singles under that moniker, in addition to Transcendence, a 1999 full-length album.  Consciousness came out on Kranky in 2001.  The band then went on hiatus (after Weber's mom died), returning with Dream House/ Dedications to Flea in 2005. (Flea was their recently deceased dog.) There was a singles compilation released in 2001, Introspection, which is 3 CDs of singles, live tracks and previously unreleased recordings.
In 2006, they released Akimatsuri, a one track (33:16 min) limited album under their label Blue Flea. It was recorded at their home between March and October 2006. The unique track is made up of 5 subtracks.
Windy & Carl have been a mainstay of the various Terrastock music festivals. In the fall of 2000 they released a CD with The Lothars, titled & Windy & Carl & The Lothars that featured live performances by each band from the San Francisco Terrastock festival as well as a 28-minute collaborative piece recorded at the London Terrastock festival.
The group has issued several other split recordings as well as a 3-CD box set, Introspection: Singles & Rarities 1993-2000. They embarked on a national tour in the summer of 2001 with Landing; the bands released a split tour-only EP to commemorate it. A highlight of this tour was being able to perform a private audience show for Sonic Youth.
October 2008 saw the release of Songs for the Broken Hearted – their 4th album in 11 years for Kranky. In December 2008, American webzine Somewhere Cold ranked Songs for the Broken Hearted No. 5 on their 2008 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame.
Hultgren and Weber ran a record store in Dearborn, called Stormy Records, until it shut down permanently.
Windy & Carl's influence can be heard in bands such as Landing, The Sight Below, Kranky labelmates White Rainbow, Growing, and Yume Bitsu.

Woob,"Woob is the stage name of Paul Frankland, an English ambient musician who started recording in the early 1990s. Woob's albums combine elements of ambient, downtempo and space music, with samples from field recordings, movies and television.  Frankland has also recorded under the names of Journeyman and Max & Harvey.  After a period working in the advertising industry, he started releasing new material as Woob in 2010: after that time, Woob's works have gradually shifted towards a more synthwave-oriented sound and adopted a cyberpunk/futuristic imagery.

Recording career
Woob
Paul Frankland started writing music as a teenager, and went on to get a master’s degree in film while also working as a DJ.
He first came to attention in the early 1990s when he submitted the track ″Void″ to the Nottingham-based t:me  [sic] recording company. The track was included on the first release by t:me’s new downtempo label Em:t, a compilation album titled em:t 0094, which led to Woob signing with the label.
Woob's first full length album, Woob 1194, was released by Em:t in 1994 and was immediately regarded as a milestone in ambient music. Production involved an Atari ST work station, Akai s950 sampler and a Gem s2 synthesizer. The tracks were mixed and performed live, which contributed to the organic and evocative nature of the music.
Following the success of his first album, which was re-released in the United States by Instinct Records, Woob contributed tracks to more Em:t compilations and to trance label Flying Rhino Records. In late 1995, he released a second album on Em:t titled Woob2 4495, which garnered further praise. A third Woob album was being planned in 1998 when Em:t went out of business.
There were no Woob releases between 1999 and 2009; during this time, Frankland was writing music and doing sound design for a number of major advertising agencies, including Ridley Scott Associates and A-Bomb. The return of Woob was heralded by the re-release of Woob 1194 at the end of 2009. The 10-minute single, ″Unknown Quantity″, was released on 1 January 2010, followed in May by the album Repurpose, which combined remixes of old material with new tracks.
The ″Paradigm Flux″ EP was released in September 2010.  Woob initially announced that the EP was a taster for a soundtrack album of the same name, but it was followed in November 2011 by ″Return to the City″ a full-length album that Frankland said would accompany a film described as a 'Paradigm Flux Prologue'.
November 2012 saw the release of the first album in what would become the Have Landed Trilogy, an aural journey through time and space. The first album, titled Have Landed was released as both a Woob album and an album by Max and Harvey. Frankland's website gave this explanation: ″Have Landed encompasses some of the best recordings previously released under the Max & Harvey moniker along with a plethora of new material including a few surprises″. Part of the surprise was the number of limited editions, with different CD covers and associated 'artifacts' including sticker sets, USB flash drives, and a model rocket ship. This was followed in September 2013 by the album ULTRASCOPE,  released in various editions including the extensively remixed ″Time Paradox″ version. More coherent than its predecessor, one reviewer noted the use of soaring synth chords, thundering drums and the use of arpeggio that was reminiscent of the Berlin School. The trilogy was completed in July 2014 with the release of ″Ambient Disaster Movie″, an album of characteristically spacey soundscapes that included samples from old science fiction films. 
Between Ultrascope and Ambient Disaster Movie, Frankland also released an album called Lost 1194, which consisted of previously unheard versions of tracks from the Woob debut album.

Journeyman
In 1994, the year of the first Woob album, Frankland also started recording with DJ Colin Waterton under contract to NTone, a sub label of Ninja Tune. The duo released two albums under the name 'Journeyman'. The first album, 'Mama 6', came out in 1994, featuring long ambient dub soundscapes, with samples of world music and movie dialogue of the kind that could be found on the Woob albums. By contrast, 'National Hijinx', released in 1997, had shorter tracks with elements of drum and bass.
The second album marked the end of Frankland's collaboration with Waterton. When asked about the partnership in an interview, Frankland said ""Colin Waterton had lots of influence on the first Journeyman album. The idea was that we'd start a record label as a duo, but it didn't happen. Colin moved on and started concentrating on other stuff. He did work on about three of the songs on 'National Hijinx' though.""

Max and Harvey
In 1998, Frankland started putting out tracks under the name 'Max and Harvey' (alternatively 'Max & Harvey').  The first track, 'Big Amoeba Sound', was a collaboration with Mark Butt (a.k.a. Scabboy) who had designed the album cover for the Journeyman album 'National Hijinx'. The group was named after Mark's dogs (who also appear in the group logo) and the track title was later pluralised to become the name of Frankland's own label 'bigamoebasounds'. The track later appeared on the Xen Cuts compilation album, marking the 10th anniversary of the Ninja Tune label.
Subsequent releases under the name of 'Max and Harvey' were the work of Frankland, although Riad Abji, who had shared a flat with Frankland and Butt, played bass and guitar on a number of early tracks by Woob, Journeyman and Max & Harvey.
Over the next decade, a handful of Max and Harvey tracks appeared on compilation albums released by Ninja Tune and Flying Rhino Records.  Two EPs containing both old and new material were released by Bigameobasounds in 2010. With the release of Have Landed in 2012, Frankland announced on his website that ""Woob has assimilated Max & Harvey"".

Legacy
AllMusic described the first two albums, Woob 1194 and Woob2 4495 as 'among the most praised and encompassing documents of post-rave ambient of the last several years', while the Ambient Music Guide describes them as 'among the most refined, subtle and innovative examples of the meeting between electronics and live instruments that flowered in the ambient environment of the 1990'
With the release of ""Return to the City"" in November 2011, the Electronic Music Guide described Woob as 'an ambient music genius'. The guide rated the new album 9.9 out of 10 and stated that it was contender for 'soundtrack of the year'. The 2013 release ULTRASCOPE was included in the Ambient Music Guide's selection of Best Albums of the year.

Yanni,"Yiannis Chryssomallis (Greek: Γιάννης Χρυσομάλλης; born November 14, 1954), known professionally as Yanni (  YAH-nee), is a Greek composer, keyboardist, pianist, and music producer.
Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel.
At least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in Billboard's ""Top New Age Album"" category, and two albums (Dare to Dream and In My Time) received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial.
Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a ""true global artist"" and his music is said to reflect his ""one world, one people"" philosophy.

Early life
Yanni was born November 14, 1954, in Kalamata, Greece, the son of a banker, Sotiri Chryssomallis, and a homemaker, Felitsa (short for Triandafelitsa, which means ""rose""). He displayed musical talent at a young age, playing the piano at the age of 6. His parents encouraged him to learn at his own pace and in his own way, without formal music training. The self-taught musician continues to use the ""musical shorthand"" that he developed as a child, rather than employ traditional musical notation.
Yanni set a Greek national record in the 50-meter freestyle swimming competition at age 14.
In November 1972, Yanni moved from Greece to the United States to attend the University of Minnesota beginning in January 1973, majoring in psychology. For a time he earned money by washing dishes at the student union. Yanni later explained that learning English forced him to read each paragraph several times in what he called a slow and frustrating process, but which helped him memorize the material and do well on tests. He received a B.A. degree in psychology in 1976.
During his time as a student, Yanni played in a local rock band and continued to study piano and other keyboard instruments. Upon graduating, when he dedicated himself exclusively to music for one full year and found he was the happiest he had ever been, he said he decided music would be his life's work.

Music career
In 1977, Yanni joined the Minneapolis-based rock group Chameleon, performing with its founder, drummer Charlie Adams, with whom he would work into the 2010s. While in Minneapolis, Yanni also worked with choreographer Loyce Houlton to provide music for dance works produced by the Minnesota Dance Theatre. After touring with Chameleon from 1980 to 1984, Yanni moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of movie soundtrack work.

1980s to early 1990s: Emergence and recognition
In 1980, Yanni recorded and produced his first album Optimystique, which Atlantic Records re-released in 1984 and Private Music re-released in 1989.
Yanni formed a band in 1987 and began to tour in 1988 with an ensemble including pianist/singer John Tesh and drummer Charlie Adams, promoting his early albums Keys to Imagination, Out of Silence, and Chameleon Days. A highlight of the tour was a performance with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra that elicited a positive review, considered seminal to Yanni's public recognition, from a Dallas Times Herald critic. Yanni's emergence was said to be ""timed perfectly"" with the growing popularity of contemporary instrumental music. In this time frame, Yanni wrote motion picture soundtracks for Steal the Sky (1988), Heart of Midnight (1988), I Love You Perfect (1989), She'll Take Romance (1990), When You Remember Me (1990), Children of the Bride (1990), and Hua qi Shao Lin (1994).

Yanni gained visibility as the result of his November 1990 appearances in People magazine and on The Oprah Winfrey Show with actress Linda Evans, with whom he had been in a relationship since 1989. However, high-visibility appearances on public television, best-selling records and videos, and overflow concerts earned him recognition beyond his relationship with Evans.
Dare to Dream, released in 1992, was Yanni's first Grammy-nominated album. It included ""Aria,"" a song based on Léo Delibes' The Flower Duet (Lakmé, 1883) and popularized by an award-winning British Airways commercial. A second Grammy-nominated album, In My Time, followed in 1993.

Yanni's breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, was filmed in September 1993 at the 2,000-year-old Herodes Atticus Theater at the Acropolis of Athens, an album, VHS and Laserdisc being released in 1994. Acropolis was Yanni's first live album, and used his core band with a full sixty piece orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra which was arranged and conducted by Iranian-American musician Shahrdad Rohani.
Without financial backing, Yanni risked $2 million of his personal fortune in the Acropolis production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. The resulting video was broadcast on PBS and became one of its most popular programs ever, seen in 65 countries by half a billion people. It became the second best-selling music concert video of all time (after Michael Jackson's Thriller), selling more than 7 million copies worldwide.
In March 1997, Yanni became one of the few Western artists permitted to perform and record at the Taj Mahal in India. Yanni followed in May 1997 with performances at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, becoming the first Western artist in modern times permitted to perform at the historic site. Live broadcasts of the two concerts were seen by 100 million television viewers throughout the world. The two events formed the live album and video, Tribute, released in November 1997.
After negotiating the demands of gaining permission to perform at the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City in 1997, breaking up with Linda Evans in early 1998, and completing a long world tour later in 1998, Yanni halted his music career. Yanni later related that he had become depressed, and returned to Greece to live with his parents for three months before traveling the world. He didn't do an interview for two years, later explaining, ""I traveled. I wanted to see other people's ideas of life, get out of the American dream.""

2000s to 2010: After a hiatus, new perspectives
In 2000, after the two-year hiatus, Yanni released If I Could Tell You, his first studio album in seven years. The album sold 55,000 copies in its first week and landed at No. 20 on the Billboard charts, his highest debut to date. Yanni described the album as more of an even-tempered ""listening"" album, less dramatic than the live concert albums Live at the Acropolis or Tribute. He explained that he himself created all the album's sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio.
The music in Yanni's 2003 album Ethnicity represented many of the world's cultures, Yanni saying it uses ethnicity to reflect the color and beauty of a multicultural society. The album was released near the publication date of Yanni's autobiography, Yanni in Words. On October 23, 2003, Yanni performed a keyboard instrumental version of The Star-Spangled Banner before Game 5 of the 2003 World Series.
For the first time in his career, Yanni brought vocalists to the forefront in the Ric Wake collaboration Yanni Voices, the artist's first studio album in six years. PBS broadcast video of a November 2008 Voices Acapulco concert weeks before the album's March 24, 2009 release by Walt Disney Records' Disney Pearl Imprint, the album release preceding a tour produced by Pearl's Buena Vista Concerts division.
The album Mexicanisimo, released in November of Mexico's bicentennial year 2010, was a tribute to that country through Yanni's collaborative interpretation of its folk music. It involved collaboration with singer-songwriter Pepe Aguilar and singer-actress Lucero.

2010s: New sound designs, and a return to world tours
The Truth of Touch album was released in February 2011, Yanni's first studio album of new material since Ethnicity eight years earlier. Truth of Touch's varied content reflected contemporary instrumental, electronic, and cinematic influences, and crossed over into popular, new age, and world music. Though Yanni said that Truth of Touch was started by experimenting with new sound designs, Allmusic's James Christopher Monger said that the album shows Yanni returning to his instrumental roots, and should appeal to fans of his music from the mid-1990s. Three of fifteen tracks on the predominantly instrumental album included vocals from respective Yanni Voices vocalists.
In April 2012, Yanni released the Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico live album CD and DVD which were recorded and filmed at two outdoor concerts on December 16 and 17, 2011 on the grounds of the Castillo (Fort) San Felipe del Morro (""El Morro""), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The recorded concerts were broadcast on PBS beginning in March 2012, the production constituting Yanni's tenth collaboration with that organization.
Yanni performed again in China in the February 9, 2013, CCTV Spring Festival Gala (annual audience 700 million) with Chinese zither artist Chang Jing in what was the first year that CCTV had invited foreign artists to perform. For the performance, Yanni released a single ""East Meets West"" which was a mashup of his several famous songs (Santorini, North Shore of Matsushima) together with a solo part performed on Chinese zither.
Yanni's 2010s tours included new vocalists, distinct from the 2008–2009 Yanni Voices vocalists, though the setlists remained predominantly instrumental.
In March 2014, Yanni released his seventeenth studio album, Inspirato, a collaboration with operatic tenor Plácido Domingo and producer Ric Wake that, like Yanni Voices five years earlier, highlighted vocal performances. In Inspirato, distinguished operatic vocalists performed remakes of songs that Yanni had previously released over his career, the songs' titles and lyrics being predominantly in the Italian language.
In March 2015, Yanni released the title soundtrack for a Chinese documentary movie Hexi Corridor.
On October 30 and 31, 2015, Yanni performed two concerts on the grounds of the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, his first performance in Egypt. The concerts included fireworks and a video broadcast from International Space Station commander Scott Kelly, and were recorded in 4K HD for subsequent broadcast on PBS. To convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011–14), an Egyptian security force of 3,000 people secured the concert area.
In December 2015, Yanni produced a song, ""Seven Billion Dreams,"" for a NASA video that marked the 15th anniversary of the International Space Station.
On December 18, 2015, Yanni released the single ""Desert Soul"" from his eighteenth studio album, Sensuous Chill, which was released on January 29, 2016. The album, which, being built around synthesizers, programmed rhythms and electronic sounds, was said to ""come full circle"" to his early-1980s albums.
Yanni's single, ""When Dreams Come True"", called a ""minimal piano-led"" piece, was composed incrementally throughout a 60-date North American tour as a series of improvisations performed during successive shows. Its first complete live performance was in February 2019 at the Winter at Tantora Festival in Al-'Ula, Saudi Arabia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Yanni's August 2019 single honoring his daughter Krystalán is called ""Ladyhawk"", alluding to how she watches over him like a guardian angel.
In November 2019, Yanni released single ""Blue"", taking inspiration from the ocean.
In the 2010s, Yanni's international tours included performances in over thirty countries on five continents, including (alphabetically) Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States (including Puerto Rico), and Uzbekistan.

2020s
In August 2020, Yanni released his nineteenth studio album ""In His Purest Form,"" containing solo piano performances of his previously released songs, and his first piano solo album since In My Time (1993).
In late 2021, Yanni began to offer non-fungible tokens.

Influences, music and concerts
Musical Influences
From childhood, Yanni accepted a wide variety of musical styles, listening to radio stations from Northern Africa, Arab countries, and Europe. He observed that ""there were no rock stations or classical stations—each station would just play everything."" Yanni's music is said to reflect his encounters with cultures around the world and embody his philosophy of ""one world, one people."" In this vein, Booth Newspapers'  Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk perceived the eclectic inspirations of Yanni's music to be an element of his success: Yanni's ""Middle Eastern and Oriental scales and mixed meters sound just exotic enough to entice his middle-of-the-road fans, but not so authentic as to mystify folks who grew up with a backbeat, so you can't lose it,"" adding that certain songs ""leave you with a sense that you've just heard a bit of a steel drum or a Greek bouzouki or a Japanese koto or possibly all three.""

Yanni's musical influences include music from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as classical, rock and roll, and electronic music. Yanni explained that the 1970s, with its new technology and electronic instruments, were particularly influential at that stage in his career, and that even recently his Truth of Touch album (2011) was started by experimenting with new sound designs. Having been exposed to classical music very early in life—listening to Bach at age 8—he counts several classical pianists and composers among his influences, citing Beethoven as a favorite and Chopin as ""No. 2 favorite."" Yanni mentioned being influenced not only by classical composers like Mozart and Bach, but also rock and roll bands such as Led Zeppelin, the People!, and Black Sabbath.
Yanni explained that ""the most influence I've ever had from music was doing (soundtracks for) movies ... mostly instrumental music,"" mentioning his love for the work of Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams. The Augusta Chronicle's Kelly Jasper noted that most of Yanni's music is instrumental, indicating that Yanni surmised that the lack of lyrics is what allowed his music to become popular internationally. Yanni went on to say, ""There are no lyrics in my music for the most part, so the whole message is transmitted through the rhythm, melody, and sounds, and I think that has to do with crossing all the borders and being able to go to different countries."" ""It is very difficult, if not impossible, to lie with instrumental music because it deals in emotions only."" He has also said that words operate in a different area of the brain, and lyrics ""tend to put a song into a box.""
However, Yanni performed with four vocalists in the forefront in Yanni Voices (2008–2009), and performed with vocalists on tours and in the Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico concerts (December 2011) and CD/DVD (2012). In late 2011 Yanni remarked that he tends to prefer instrumental music ""because it's more open, but the human voice too can be the most expressive instrument known to man. There is power to it."" Referring to his creative experiences on the 2009 Voices project, Yanni explained that ""while most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument.""

Music genres distinguished from the ""new age"" spiritual movement
While Yanni has said that new age is ""a spiritual definition more than a musical definition,"" his music is said to be ""adopted by"" the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and has been described as ""an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock."" However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as ""Greek"" and ""new age,"" emphasizing that ""when someone says new age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested."" Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: ""New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic.""
In 2012, Yanni remarked that he has never liked putting art into categories or assigning labels, adding that he always composed music ""to honestly reflect the lessons learned and the experiences I have shared throughout my life."" For example, Yanni's university study of psychology influenced his music: ""When I create music, it is a reflection of my soul, my experiences in life and my relationships with other people and cultures. Psychology, and understanding who we are as people in this world, is present in almost every creative thought I have.""

Unconventional career track
The genre of Yanni's music made it unsuitable for most commercial radio or for music television. In 2012 Yanni expressed the importance of PBS to his career, saying that the network ""always allowed me to present my music without any censorship or influence, and encouraged me to be the artist that I am,"" and had been ""a great part of my career for over 20 years.""
Yanni took an unconventional path to recognition, for example, by risking his personal fortune to fund historic-monument events such as his 1993 Acropolis concerts, by producing specials on public television, by creating alone in his home-built studio, and by performing many of his own production duties—thus by-passing the conventional music industry. In 2000, The Washington Post's David Segal wrote that Yanni was ""a living metaphor for 'success on your own terms,' the dream of every American with an idea that is either ridiculed or ignored.""

Music
In an early-career review in the Dallas Times Herald in the late 1980s, Yanni's concert with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was described as ""exhilarating, moving and inspiring."" In 1995, The Los Angeles Times'  Don Heckman wrote that Yanni's music is ""based on sweeping romantic melodies underscored with energetic Mediterranean rhythms."" More analytically, the Hartford Courant's Steve Metcalf ""deconstructed"" Yanni's music as being ""from a harmonic standpoint, constructed of materials found in a lot of late-19th, early 20th century classical music. It is essentially tonal, tinged with mild whiffs of dissonance here and there, sometimes rhythmically frisky, graspable on first listening, and self-evidently mood-inducing. There are two basic moods to Yanni music: struttingly heroic with martial overtones, and dreamily contemplative ... A kind of peaceful, easy-feeling link between pop music and classical music.""
More recently, Allmusic's Mark Deming characterized Yanni's compositions and performances as having ""a pronounced sense of drama, dynamics, and romanticism,"" writing that Yanni has a ""commanding performance style."" Rob Garratt wrote in The National that Yanni ""breaks all the rules"" in producing music ""typically in two modes – poundingly heroic or reflectively ambient."" In 2012 Howie Grapek remarked in The Palm Beach Post's PBPulse that ""there are few modern-day composers with a unique sense of music and style which is truly their own. To compare new-age music with classic rock is a stretch, but for Yanni, it is possible. This Greek composer marries contemporary new-age spirituality with today's pop attitudes and delivers a unique sound."" Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra.
Having been called a ""true global artist,"" Yanni has employed musicians of various nationalities, and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments from around the world from an Australian didgeridoo to a Peruvian charango, to perform with his classical orchestra, rock rhythm section, and electronic keyboards. His music is described as ""an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds, from Native American chants to African rhythms and Asian harmonies."" Before his 2015 concerts at the Egyptian Pyramids Yanni said that emotions are the same throughout the world, and that his predominantly instrumental music can communicate those emotions with people everywhere because it bypasses language.
The Morning Call's John L. Moser wrote that ""trends come and trends go,"" but that Yanni's music ""seems to defy trends and ... feels like it's music for all time."" Moser interviewed the composer, asking if he intentionally tries to create ""something that's going to last forever as opposed to something that's just going to sell 1 million copies right away,"" Yanni replied that ""There's no way you can create art to last forever ... so you can't have that in your mind."" Instead, describing his creative process, Yanni explained that his knowledge of music and instruments and his experience in different cultures is a ""primordial soup that comes together and it shows itself and it appears. And it's fluid. It's effortless.""
Yanni's popularity with the public and his success on public television have contrasted sharply with views of some critics. The more extreme criticisms include statements that Yanni's music is ""aural wallpaper ... lacking in substance"" or characterizing Yanni as a ""no-talent poseur"" whose music has little intellectual weight, while his fans' opinions have been paraphrased as calling Yanni a ""highly original artist whose profound spirituality has created a unique kind of music."" In this regard, one commentator wrote in 2019 that Yanni's songs are ""hazy and undefinable"" and ""unstructured in the traditional way"", paraphrasing Yanni's statement that listeners' responses depend on the degree to which they ""invest themselves in the music"", which has a ""relentless focus on feeling rather than hooks"".
Yanni claims to have had perfect pitch since childhood. He continues to use the ""musical shorthand"" that he developed as a child rather than employ traditional musical notation, and hires someone to perform what he calls the ""tedious process"" of making conventional written charts for orchestra members. Even so, since music is an auditory domain, Yanni must train the musicians in what cannot be conveyed in that writing.

Concerts and live streaming
The Palm Beach Post's Howie Grapek remarked about an April 2012 performance that the show was not a one-man keyboard show, but spotlighted individual long solos showcasing the band members' talents, and that Yanni ""loves giving them the opportunity to shine individually."" Booth Newspapers'  Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk commented that Yanni ""has great sidemen – always has."" Further, Yanni expands sound variety by using multiple interchangeable keyboards that are interconnected so that playing one keyboard can cause other keyboards to play corresponding notes emulating different instruments.
Yanni's concerts, known for their lighting and other technical aspects, require over 2,000 timing cues for a show's lighting. Yanni's longtime lighting designer remarked in 2013 that the lighting is critically timed to Yanni's music itself, accommodating its variety of time signatures, further observing that since Yanni plays mostly theatrical venues rather than arenas, the lighting can include subtle moves and color. The lighting also emphasizes band members' solos, as well as specific moments in the concerts.
Commenting on Yanni's ""great lighting"" on the stage and ""plenty of reverb in the audience,"" Booth Newspapers'  Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk remarked that a Yanni concert ""can be an intoxicating experience.""
In early 2017 Yanni began his ""An Evening in Conversation with Yanni"" or ""An intimate Conversation with Yanni"" tour in which audience questions and on-stage participation guided the show, and Yanni played a piano without a band. In May-June 2019, Yanni performed a multi-night residency at New York’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, two videos for which topped Billboard's Top Facebook Live Videos chart before other Yanni videos topped the same chart in October December 2019, and February 2020.

Honors, awards and distinctions
In addition to performing at venues such as Royal Albert Hall (London; 1995 & 2014), Yanni has performed at such world landmarks as the Acropolis of Athens (Greece; 1993), the Taj Mahal (Agra, India; 1997), the Forbidden City (Beijing, China; 1997), the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 2011), the Kremlin (Moscow, Russia; 2011), the Castillo San Felipe del Morro (""El Morro"" UNESCO World Heritage Site, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, U.S. territory; 2011), the ancient city of Byblos (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lebanon; 2013), the Roman Theatre of Carthage (Tunis, Tunisia; 2014), Laxmi Vilas Palace (Vadodara, India; 2015), the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza (Egypt, 2015), the Amman Citadel (Jordan, 2016), the Prambanan Temple (Indonesia, 2019) and Al-'Ula (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Saudi Arabia; 2019).
Rising in popularity with the new age music boom of the 1980s and 1990s, Yanni's music became more well known through adult alternative radio airplay, appearances on public television and in television commercials, as well as international music tours. Yanni's music has been used in television shows and televised sporting events, including the British Open (golf), the U.S. Open (golf), the Super Bowl, Wide World of Sports, U.S. Open tennis championships, the Tour de France, the World Figure Skating Championships, and the Olympic Games. He also composed music for ABC's World News Now.

Yanni's ""Acroyali/Standing in Motion"" was determined to have the ""Mozart effect"" by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine (April 2001) because the composition is similar to Mozart's K 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability, characteristics thought to decrease seizure activity and to enhance spatial-temporal performance.
During Yanni's October 2011 tour of China, Yanni became the first Western artist to be invited to adopt a giant panda (bear) cub at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a ""privilege ... usually reserved for countries rather than personalities."" ""Officials from the research base invited the musician to adopt the animal, saying their decision was made from the inspiration and harmony that derives from his music."" Yanni named the panda ""Santorini,"" also the name of a Greek island, explaining that the Greek word irini means 'peace'.""
In February 2013, Yanni and Celine Dion were the first non-Chinese artists invited to perform (separately) in China at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a CCTV televised event with an annual audience of 700 million.
Billboard named Yanni their No. 5 ""new age album artist of 2016"". He was named to the same list in 2014 (No. 6), 2012 (ranked No. 5), 2011 (No. 1), 2010 (No. 4), 2009 (No. 3), 2007 (No. 4), and 2006 (No. 4).
Yanni's albums Dare to Dream (1992) and In My Time (1993) received Grammy Award nominations for Best New Age Album.""
The PBS specials Live at the Acropolis and Tribute received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, Movie or Special, in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Lee Rose and David ""Gurn"" Kaniski Lighting Designers.
At least sixteen Yanni albums peaked at No. 1 in Billboard's ""Top New Age Album"" category, more than anyone except Jim Brickman and Mannheim Steamroller.
In addition to earning a B.A. in psychology in 1976 from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Yanni received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the same institution on May 6, 2004.

Charitable and humanitarian activities
Yanni has had a collaborative relationship with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in its fundraising efforts since the early years of his career, reportedly raising more than $13 million for that organization. The Yanni Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico production (2012) was Yanni's tenth collaboration with PBS.
Yanni has assisted the conservation efforts of the World Wide Fund for Nature (the World Wildlife Fund, WWF), sponsoring a symbolic ""Panda Adoption Kit"" program in which he guaranteed $50,000 in donations. Yanni has also been a spokesman for NASA.
Yanni has performed concerts in troubled areas of the world, such as in Tunisia one week after the July 17, 2014, terrorist attack that killed 14, and in Egypt to convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011–14) but between whose two Great Pyramids concerts occurred the October 31, 2015, terrorist downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 in the Sinai Peninsula.

Autobiography
Yanni's autobiography, Yanni in Words, co-authored by David Rensin, was published in February 2003, coinciding with the release of his Ethnicity album. The book became a New York Times best seller in the nonfiction category on March 2, 2003.

Yellow Magic Orchestra,"Yellow Magic Orchestra (abbreviated to YMO) was a Japanese electronic music band formed in Tokyo in 1978 by Haruomi Hosono (bass, keyboards, vocals), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums, lead vocals, occasional keyboards) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards, vocals). The group is considered influential and innovative in the field of popular electronic music. They were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers, and digital recording technology, and effectively anticipated the ""electropop boom"" of the 1980s. They are credited with playing a key role in the development of several electronic genres, including synthpop, J-pop, electro, and techno, while exploring subversive sociopolitical themes throughout their career.
The three members were veterans of the music industry before coming together as YMO, and were inspired by eclectic sources, including the electronic music of Isao Tomita and Kraftwerk, Japanese traditional music, arcade games, funk music, and the disco productions of Giorgio Moroder. They released the surprise global hit ""Computer Game"" in 1978, reaching the UK Top 20 and selling 400,000 copies in the U.S. For their early recordings and performances, the band was often accompanied by programmer Hideki Matsutake. The group released several albums before pausing their activity in 1984. They briefly reunited several times in subsequent decades before Takahashi and Sakamoto's deaths in 2023.

History
1976–1978: early years and formation
Prior to the group's formation, Sakamoto had been experimenting with electronic music equipment at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, which he entered in 1970, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP. The group leader Haruomi Hosono had been using an Ace Tone rhythm machine since early in his career in the early 1970s. Following the break-up of his band Happy End in 1972, Hosono became involved in the recording of several early electronic rock records, including Yōsui Inoue's folk pop rock album Kōri no Sekai (1973) and Osamu Kitajima's progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten (1974), both of which utilized synthesizers, electric guitars, electric bass, and in the latter, electronic drums, and rhythm machines. Also around the same time, the band's future ""fourth member"" Hideki Matsutake was the assistant for the internationally successful electronic musician Isao Tomita. Much of the methods and techniques developed by both Tomita and Matsutake during the early 1970s would later be employed by Yellow Magic Orchestra.
Sakamoto first worked with Hosono as a member of his live band in 1976, while Yukihiro Takahashi recruited Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the Sadistic Mika Band. Hosono invited both to work on his exotica-flavoured album Paraiso, which included electronic songs produced using various electronic equipment. The band was named ""Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band"" as a satire of Japan's obsession with black magic at the time, and in late 1977 they began recording Paraiso, which was released in 1978. The three worked together again for the 1978 album Pacific, which included an early version of the song ""Cosmic Surfin"". 
Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside Hideki Matsutake in early 1978 for Hosono's experimental ""electro-exotica"" fusion album Cochin Moon, which fused electronic music with Indian music, including an early ""synth raga"" song ""Hum Ghar Sajan"". The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto, experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and traditional Japanese music in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto's songs, ""Thousand Knives"", in the album. Thousand Knives was also notable for its early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer, with Matsutake as its music programmer for the album.
While Sakamoto was working on Thousand Knives, Hosono began formulating the idea of an instrumental disco band which could have the potential to reach success in non-Japanese-language territories, and invited Tasuo Hayashi of Tin Pan Alley and Hiroshi Sato of Huckleback as participants, but they declined. Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi eventually collaborated again to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra and they began recording their self-titled album at a Shibaura studio in July 1978.

1978–1983: National and international success
The band's 1978 self-titled album Yellow Magic Orchestra was successful and the studio project grew into a fully fledged touring band and career for its three members. The album featured the use of computer technology (along with synthesizers) which, according to Billboard, allowed the group to create a new sound that was not possible until then. Following the release of the album Yellow Magic Orchestra, a live date at the Roppongi Pit Inn was seen by executives of A&M Records of the USA who were in the process of setting up a partnership deal with Alfa Records. This led to the YMO being offered an international deal, at which point (early 1979) the three members decided the group would be given priority over their solo careers. The most popular international hit from the album was ""Firecracker"", which would be released as a single the following year and again as ""Computer Game"", which became a success in the United States and Europe.
Following an advertising deal with Fuji Cassette, the group sparked a boom in the popularity of electronic pop music, called ""technopop"" in Japan, where they had an effect similar to that of the Beatles and Merseybeat in 1960s Britain. For some time, YMO was the most popular band in Japan. Successful solo act Akiko Yano (later married to Sakamoto) joined the band for its live performances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but did not participate in the studio recordings. On the other hand, the YMO trio contributed to her own albums and became part of her live band, during these same years. Legendary English guitarist Bill Nelson, who had disbanded Be-Bop Deluxe and Red Noise to more recently explore Electropop himself, likewise played on YMO's Naughty Boys (1983), its non-vocals variant Naughty Boys Instrumental (1984) and subsequent solo Yukihiro Takahashi projects, before featuring the latter on two of Nelson's own UK based releases.
Making abundant use of new synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers and digital recording technology as it became available, as well as utilizing cyberpunk-ish lyrics sung mostly in English, they extended their popularity and influence beyond Japan.
Their second album Solid State Survivor, released in 1979, was YMO's pinnacle recording in Japan, winning the 1980 Best Album Award in the Japan Record Awards. It featured English lyrics by Chris Mosdell, whose sci-fi themes often depicted a human condition alienated by dystopic futures, much like the emerging cyberpunk movement in fiction at that time. One of the album's major singles, and one of the band's biggest international hits, was ""Behind the Mask"", which YMO had first produced in 1978 for a Seiko quartz wristwatch commercial, and then for Solid State Survivor with lyrics penned by Chris Mosdell. The song was later revised by Michael Jackson, who added new lyrics and had intended to include it in his album Thriller. Despite the approval of songwriter Sakamoto and lyricist Chris Mosdell, it was eventually removed from the album due to legal issues with YMO's management. Jackson's version was never released until his first posthumous album, Michael, though his additional lyrics were included in later cover versions of the song by Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton, and Ryuichi Sakamoto himself in his 1986 solo release Media Bahn Live. Solid State Survivor included several early computerized synth rock songs, including a mechanized cover version of ""Day Tripper"" by the Beatles.
Solid State Survivor went on to sell over 2 million records worldwide. By 1980, YMO had become the most popular group in Japan, where they were performing to sold-out crowds. Their first live album Public Pressure set a record in Japan, topping the charts and selling 250,000 copies within two weeks, while their next studio album X∞Multiplies had 200,000 pre-orders before release. The same year, their albums Solid State Survivor and X∞Multiplies held the top two spots on the Oricon charts for seven consecutive weeks, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat.
The 1980 song ""Multiplies"" was an early experiment in electronic ska. X∞Multiplies was followed up with the 1981 album BGM. ""Rap Phenomena"" from the album was an early attempt at electronic rap.
They also had similar success abroad, performing to sold-out crowds during tours in the United States and Europe. The single ""Computer Game"" had sold 400,000 copies in the United States and reached No. 17 in the UK Charts. The group also performed ""Firecracker"" and ""Tighten Up"" live on the Soul Train television show. At around the same time, the 1980 song ""Riot in Lagos"" by YMO member Sakamoto pioneered the beats and sounds of electro music. The band was particularly popular with the emerging hip hop community, which appreciated the group's electronic sounds, and in the Bronx where ""Firecracker"" was a success and sampled in the famous Death Mix (1983) by Afrika Bambaataa. Meanwhile, in Japan, YMO remained the best-selling music act there up until 1982.

1984–1993: breakup and brief reunion
The band had paused their group activities by 1984. After the release of their musical motion picture Propaganda, the three members had returned to their solo careers. They were careful to avoid saying they had ""split up"", preferring to use the Japanese phrase meaning ""spreading out"" (散開, sankai), and the trio continued to play on each other's recordings and made guest appearances at live shows. Takahashi, in particular, would play the band's material in his concerts. Meanwhile, Sakamoto would gain international success for his work as a solo artist, actor, and film composer, winning Grammy, Oscar, and Golden Globe awards.
Yellow Magic Orchestra released a one-off reunion album, Technodon, and credited it to 'NOT YMO' (YMO crossed out with a calligraphy X) or YMO in 1993. Instead of traditional vocals, about half of it features field audio recordings and samples of authors and scientists reading their work. During their brief reunion in the early 1990s, they continued to experiment with new styles of electronic music, playing an instrumental role in the techno and acid house movements of the era.

2002–2023: post-breakup and reformation
The early 2000s saw Hosono and Takahashi reunited in a project called Sketch Show. On a number of occasions Ryuichi Sakamoto has joined in on Sketch Show performances and recording sessions. He later proposed they rename the group Human Audio Sponge when he participates. Barcelona performance at Sonar festival and Wild Sketch Show DVDs chronicle these reunions, and include a tongue-in-cheek Japanese text-only history of the group that spans to 2036.
The band have reunited in 2007 for an advertising campaign for Kirin Lager which lampooned their longevity and charted No.1 on various Japanese digital download charts (including iTunes Store chart) with the song ""Rydeen 79/07"", released on Sakamoto's new label commmons. Recently performing live as Human Audio Sponge; Hosono, Sakamoto, and Takahashi did a live performance together as Yellow Magic Orchestra for the Live Earth, Kyoto, event on July 7, 2007, which raised money and awareness of a ""climate in crisis"".
In August 2007, the band once again reformed, taking the name HASYMO or HAS/YMO, combining the names of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their first single under this name, ""Rescue"", was written for the film Appleseed EX Machina. They released a new two song single titled ""The City of Light/Tokyo Town Pages"" on August 6, 2008. HASYMO played two live concerts in Europe in the summer of 2008, one at the Royal Festival Hall, London on June 15, as part of the Meltdown festival of music curated by Massive Attack and another in Gijón, Spain, on the 19th. Although the primary YMO members (Yukihiro Takahashi, Haruomi Hosono, and Ryuichi Sakamoto) were effectively known as HASYMO and played both these concerts, these concerts were billed simply as ""YMO"" but featured only 4 YMO songs in each concert while the rest of the concert featured Sketch Show, HASYMO music and members' solo works.
In August 2009, the band played the World Happiness festival in Japan, featuring many Japanese artists. The band closed the night, and confirmed that ""Yellow Magic Orchestra"" was their official name, dropping the HASYMO title. They opened with a cover of ""Hello, Goodbye"" and performed old YMO songs along with their newer songs.
In August 2010, YMO once again closed their World Happiness festival. They added classic songs from their back catalog into their set list. They also covered ""Hello, Goodbye"" and ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"". In January 2011, KCRW announced for their World Festival concert series that Yellow Magic Orchestra will perform at the Hollywood Bowl on June 26, 2011. Not long after, a concert for June 27, 2011, at The Warfield was added. It was announced in February that YMO would perform at the Fuji Rock festival in July and the World Happiness festival 2011 on August 7.
In 2012, Sakamoto helped organize the No Nukes 2012 festival held in the Makuhari Messe hall in Chiba, Japan, on July 7 and 8, 2012. Among the many artists performing, Kraftwerk closed the July 7 concert, with YMO performing on both days, closing the July 8 concert. YMO also headlined their World Happiness festival on August 12, 2012. After these performances, the band once again went quiet; though no formal announcement was made of a hiatus or breakup, the band ultimately did not reconvene for further recordings or headlining concerts.
On June 23, 2018, Hosono played his debut UK solo concert at the Barbican Centre in London; Takahashi and Sakamoto joined him on stage to perform ""Absolute Ego Dance"", marking the final time that the three would appear together in public. (The band featured in Hosono's second and third ""Yellow Magic Show"" on Japanese TV, both recorded in 2019; their appearance in the third was in front of a live audience, but Sakamoto appeared via prerecorded video.)

2023: Takahashi and Sakamoto's deaths
On January 11, 2023, Takahashi died at the age of 70, following a case of pneumonia. He had undergone surgery to remove a brain tumor in 2020 but continued to have health troubles that interfered with his musical activities in the intervening years. That same year, Sakamoto died on March 28 at the age of 71, following a lengthy battle with cancer; leaving Hosono as the last surviving member of the group.

Musical style and development
While their contemporaries in Düsseldorf, and later Detroit, were using synthesizer technology to create bleak dystopian music, YMO introduced a more ""joyous and liberating"" approach to electronic music. According to Sakamoto, they were ""tired"" of Japanese musicians imitating Western and American music at the time and so they wanted to ""make something very original from Japan."" Kraftwerk was particularly an influence on Sakamoto, who heard the band in the mid-1970s and later introduced them to his fellow band members. They were impressed with Kraftwerk's ""very formalized"" style but wanted to avoid imitating their ""very German"" approach. He described Kraftwerk's music as ""theoretical, very focused, simple and minimal and strong"". Their alternative template for electronic pop was less minimalistic, made more varying use of synthesizer lines, introduced ""fun-loving and breezy"" sounds, and placed a strong emphasis on melody in contrast to Kraftwerk's statuesque ""robot pop"".
The band also drew from a wider range of influences than had been employed by Kraftwerk. These influences on YMO included Japanese electronic music (such as Isao Tomita), traditional Japanese music, experimental Chinese music (of the Cultural Revolution era), Indian music (such as Ravi Shankar and Bollywood music), arcade game samples, American rap, exotica, Caribbean ska, Giorgio Moroder's disco work, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and their leader Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, classical music, animal sounds, and noise. Sakamoto has expressed that his ""concept when making music is that there is no border between music and noise.""

Sampling
Their approach to sampling music was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology. Their 1978 hit ""Computer Game / Firecracker"", for example, sampled Martin Denny's 1959 exotica melody ""Firecracker"" and arcade game sounds from Space Invaders and Circus. According to The Vinyl District magazine, they also released the first album to feature mostly samples and loops (1981's Technodelic). The pace at which the band's music evolved has been acknowledged by critics. According to SF Weekly, YMO's musical timeline has gone from ""zany exotica-disco spoofs"" and ""bleeps and blips"" in the 1970s to ""sensuous musique concrète perfected"" in their 1983 albums Naughty Boys and Service.
Technodelic (1981) was produced using the LMD-649, a PCM digital sampler that Toshiba-EMI sound engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO. Soon after Technodelic, the LMD-649 was used by YMO-associated acts such as Chiemi Manabe and Logic System.

Instruments
The band often utilized a wide variety of state-of-the-art electronic music equipment immediately as they were made available. The group leader Haruomi Hosono had already been using an Ace Tone rhythm machine since early in his career in the early 1970s. Yellow Magic Orchestra and Ryuichi Sakamoto's Thousand Knives were one of the earliest popular music albums to utilize the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which was programmed by Hideki Matsutake during recording sessions. Roland called the MC-8 a ""computer music composer"" and it was the first stand-alone microprocessor-based music sequencer. It also introduced features such as a keypad to enter note information and 16 KB of RAM which allowed a maximum sequence length of 5200 notes, a huge step forward from the 8–16 step sequencers of the era. While it was commercially unsuccessful due to its high price, the band were among the few bands at the time to utilize the MC-8, which they described as, along with its music programmer Hideki Matsutake, an ""inevitable factor"" in both their music production and live performances. ""Behind the Mask"" (1979) made use of synthesizers for the melodies and digital gated reverb for the snare drums.
They were also the very first band to utilize the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, one of the first and most influential programmable drum machines, as soon as it was released in 1980. While the machine was initially unsuccessful due to its lack of digital sampling that the rival Linn LM-1 offered, the TR-808 featured various unique artificial percussion sounds, including a deep bass kick drum, ""tinny handclap sounds"", ""the ticky snare, the tishy hi-hats (open and closed)"", and ""the spacey cowbell"", which YMO utilized and demonstrated in their music, as early as its year of release in 1980, paving the way for the TR-808's mainstream popularity several years later, after which it would be used for more hit records than any other drum machine and continue to be widely used through to the present day.
At the time, Billboard noted that the use of such computer-based technology in conjunction with synthesizers allowed YMO to create new sounds that were not possible until then. Yellow Magic Orchestra was also the first computer-themed music album, coming before Kraftwerk's Computer World (1981) by several years. As a result of such innovations, YMO were credited at the time for having ""ushered in the age of the computer programmer as rock star.""
Other electronic equipment used by the group included the LMD-649 sampler (see Sampling above), Roland MC-4 Microcomposer sequencer, Pollard Syndrum electronic drums, Roland VP-330 and Korg VC-10 vocoders, Yamaha CS-80 and DX7 synthesizers, Korg PS-3100 and PS-3300 synthesizers, Moog III-C and Polymoog synthesizers, and ARP Odyssey, Oberheim 8 Voice, and E-mu Emulator synthesizers. Electric instruments were also used, the Fender Rhodes piano and Fender Jazz Bass.

Legacy
The band has been described as ""the original cyberpunks"" and their early work has been described as ""proto-techno"" music. By the 1990s, YMO were also frequently cited as pioneers of ambient house music. YMO also popularized a style of live performance that eschewed human movement in favour of electronics such as rhythm boxes and samplers. They also influenced the New Romantic movement, including British bands Duran Duran and Japan, whose member Steve Jansen was influenced by drummer Takahashi, while lead member David Sylvian was influenced by Sakamoto, who would later collaborate with Sylvian.
Various cover versions of ""Kimi ni Mune Kyun"" (1983) have also been produced by other artists, including The Human League in 1993 (""YMO Versus The Human League"") and Asako Toki in 2006. In 2009, a cover of ""Kimi ni Mune Kyun"" was used as the ending theme song for the anime adaptation of Maria Holic, sung by Asami Sanada, Marina Inoue, and Yū Kobayashi, the voice actresses of the main characters. In 2015, in the anime Sound! Euphonium, episode 5, the song ""Rydeen"" is played by Kitauji highschool's orchestra. The popular anime series Dragon Ball Z also paid homage to the band with the song ""Solid State Scouter"" as the theme song of the 1990 TV special Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku.
In HMV Japan's list of top 100 Japanese musicians of all time, YMO were voted second place, behind only Southern All Stars, a pop-rock band who remain largely unknown outside Japan. In 2006, Senor Coconut paid tribute to the band with his Yellow Fever! album.

Electronic music
YMO were pioneers of synthpop, a genre which emerged at the start of the 1980s. In 1993, Johnny Black of Hi-Fi News, in a review for the record Hi-Tech/No Crime, described YMO as ""the most adventurous and influential electro-techno-dance technicians the world has produced"" and further argued that ""without them (and Kraftwerk) today's music would still sound like yesterday's music."" In 2001, Jason Ankeny of the Allmusic Guide to Electronica described YMO as ""a seminal influence on contemporary electronic music – hugely popular both at home and abroad"" and placed them ""second only to Kraftwerk as innovators of today's electronic culture.""
YMO are considered pioneers in the field of popular electronic music, and continue to be remixed or sampled by modern artists, including experimental artist Yamantaka Eye, electronica group LFO, jungle band 4hero, electrolatino artist Senor Coconut, ambient house pioneers The Orb and 808 State, electronic music groups Orbital and The Human League, hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, and mainstream pop musicians such as Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton, Mariah Carey, and Jennifer Lopez.
YMO also influenced techno music, including its pioneers Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May, who cited YMO as an important influence on their work alongside Kraftwerk. YMO continued to influence later techno musicians such as Surgeon, μ-Ziq, and Cosmic Baby. ""Technopolis"" (1979) in particular is considered an ""interesting contribution"" to the development of Detroit techno and the group Cybotron. ""Computer Game"" (1978) also influenced Sheffield's bleep techno music; the Warp record, Sweet Exorcist's ""Testone"" (1990), defined Sheffield's techno sound by making playful use of sampled sounds from ""Computer Game"" along with dialogues from the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). ""Computer Game"" (1978) was later included in Carl Craig's compilation album Kings of Techno (2006).
In the 1990s, YMO influenced ambient house pioneers such as The Orb and 808 State, as well as Ultramarine and other ambient/house artists. This resulted in the release of the tribute remix album Yellow Magic Orchestra: Hi-Tech/No Crime in 1993, by leading ambient, house and techno musicians at the time, including The Orb, 808 State, and Orbital. The music YMO produced during their comeback in the early 1990s also played an instrumental role in the techno and acid house movements towards the end of the 20th century. The band's use of oriental musical scales and video game sounds has continued to be an influence on 21st-century electronica acts such as Dizzee Rascal, Kieran Hebden, and Ikonika.
YMO's success with music technology encouraged many others, with their influence strongly felt in the British electronic scene of the early 1980s in particular. They influenced many early British synthpop acts, including Ultravox, John Foxx, Gary Numan, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode,  Camouflage, OMD, The Human League, Visage, and Art of Noise, as well as American rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren.
""Technopolis"", a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca that used the term ""techno"" in its title, foreshadowed concepts that Juan Atkins and Rick Davis would later have with Cybotron.

Hip hop
The band was popular with the emerging hip hop community, which appreciated the group's new electronic sounds, and in the Bronx where Firecracker was a success and sampled in the famous Death Mix by Afrika Bambaataa.  Afrika Bambaataa's influential song ""Planet Rock"" was partly inspired by YMO. The ""terse videogame-funk"" sounds of YMO's ""Computer Game"" would have a strong influence on the emerging electro and hip hop genres. Sakamoto's ""Riot in Lagos"" was cited by Kurtis Mantronik as a major influence on his early electro hip hop group Mantronix; he included both ""Computer Game"" and ""Riot in Lagos"" in his compilation album That's My Beat (2002) which consists of the songs that influenced his early career. The song was also later included in Playgroup's compilation album Kings of Electro (2007), alongside later electro classics such as Hashim's ""Al-Nafyish"" (1983). The 1980 release of ""Riot in Lagos"" was also listed by The Guardian in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music.
YMO's use of video game sounds and bleeps also had a particularly big influence on 1980s hip hop and pop music. Beyond electro acts, ""Computer Game / Firecracker"" was also sampled by a number of other later artists, including 2 Live Crew's ""Mega-Mixx II"" (1987), De La Soul's ""Funky Towel"" (for the 1996 film Joe's Apartment), Jennifer Lopez's ""I'm Real"" (2001), and the original unreleased version of Mariah Carey's ""Loverboy"" (2001).

Japan
The band has also been very influential in its homeland Japan, where they had become the most popular group during the late 1970s and 1980s. Their albums Solid State Survivor and X∞Multiplies held the top two spots on the Oricon charts for seven consecutive weeks in 1980, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat. Young fans of their music during this period became known as the ""YMO Generation"" (YMO世代, YMO Sedai). 
The band significantly affected Japanese pop music, which started becoming increasingly dominated by electronic and computer music due to YMO's influence. YMO were one of the most important acts in Japan's ""New Music"" movement and paved the way for the emergence of contemporary J-pop in the 1980s. They also inspired early ambient techno artists such as Tetsu Inoue, and the classical music composer Joe Hisaishi. The manga author Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, cited Yellow Magic Orchestra as his favorite music band in a 1980 interview.

Video games
YMO also influenced many video game composers and significantly affected the sounds used in much of the chiptune and video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. In 1994, four video game composers employed at Namco formed a parody band called Oriental Magnetic Yellow (OMY), producing parody cover versions of various YMO records, consisting of Shinji Hosoe as Haruomi Hosonoe, Nobuyoshi Sano as Ryuichi Sanomoto, Takayuki Aihara as Takayukihiro Aihara, and Hiroto Sasaki as Hideki Sasatake.

History
1986–2007: Early life and career beginnings
Ólafur's grandmother introduced him to the music of Frédéric Chopin from an early age.
In 2004, Ólafur composed and recorded the intro and two outros for tracks on the album Antigone by German metal band Heaven Shall Burn. On his Facebook page, he described how he got to know them: ""I was playing drums in a hardcore band and we were supporting the German metal band Heaven Shall Burn on their Icelandic tour. Being a huge fan, I gave them a demo with some very overly dramatic prog-rock songs I had been making at home – it was not so classic like this but had some badly computerized strings and piano in it. A few months later they contacted me asked if I would write some intros and outros for their new album, but only with the piano/strings elements – So I wrote my first classical pieces. Their album was a big success in Europe and a few months later I got a phone call from a label asking 'would you be interested in making a full album with compositions like this?' I hadn't really considered continuing writing music like this, but said yes.""

2007–2008: Eulogy For Evolution and Variations of Static
On 12 October 2007, Ólafur's first solo album Eulogy for Evolution was released. It was followed by the EP Variations of Static in 2008. In the same year, Ólafur toured with Sigur Rós and his second collaboration with Heaven Shall Burn, the album Iconoclast (Part 1: The Final Resistance), was released. He is also reported to have sold out The Barbican Hall in London.

2009: Found Songs and Dyad 1909
In April 2009, Ólafur composed and released a track daily for seven days, instantly making each track available within 24 hours from foundsongs.erasedtapes.com. The collection of tracks was entitled Found Songs. The first track was released on 13 April.
In October 2009, the ballet Dyad 1909 premiered with a score composed by Ólafur which was also released as an EP.
Also in 2009, Ólafur formed an experimental techno project, Kiasmos, with Janus Rasmussen from the Icelandic electro-pop band Bloodgroup. They released a joint EP with Ryan Lee West of the EDM project Rival Consoles entitled 65/Milo.

2010–2011: Second studio album and Living Room Songs
In April 2010, Ólafur released a new album entitled ...And They Have Escaped The Weight of Darkness. During 2010 Ólafur also went on a well-received Asian Tour organised by China-based promoter Split Works.
On 3 October 2011, Ólafur started another seven-day composition project similar to Found Songs, this one entitled Living Room Songs. The tracks were made available at livingroomsongs.olafurarnalds.com/ each day throughout the week. The project was released as an album on 23 December 2011.
2011 also saw the release of Ólafur's remix of Mr Fogg's track ""Keep Your Teeth Sharp"" on the EP of the same name.

Also in 2012, his song ""Allt varð hljótt"" was used in the score and the soundtrack for the film The Hunger Games.
""Til enda"" was used in a trailer for the 2012 film Looper.

2013–2014: For Now I Am Winter and further scores
Ólafur released his third studio album entitled For Now I Am Winter in February 2013. Four tracks featured vocals from Arnór Dan of the Icelandic band Agent Fresco. This was the first time Ólafur incorporated vocals into any of his released work.
More recently, he composed the score and end-credits track for the 2013 ITV series Broadchurch (again featuring the vocals of Arnór Dan), for which he won the 2014 BAFTA TV Craft Award for Best Original Music.
Ólafur also composed the score for Ron Krauss' film Gimme Shelter.
For Now I Am Winter was used in the pilot of the 2013 US TV show Masters of Sex.
Ólafur Arnalds has been involved with various other projects and his music appears in many films, television shows and advertisements. His songs have been featured on So You Think You Can Dance in multiple seasons. He also spoke at length on the subject of fan-submitted art in the 2011 documentary film Press Pause Play.
In 2014 Ólafur announced his electronic debut album in collaboration with Janus Rasmussen under his project Kiasmos.

2015: The Chopin Project and further projects
In 2015 Ólafur collaborated with German-Japanese pianist Alice Sara Ott on The Chopin Project, which was a release to introduce an exciting new take on the music of Frédéric Chopin. Arnalds chose a program of Chopin works to create an emotional arc throughout the album and then composed linking sections for string quintet, piano, and synthesizer based on the atmosphere and motifs of those pieces.
The Chopin Project began as a dedication to Ólafur's grandmother, in some respects. Out of respect for her, a younger, metal-loving Ólafur would sit with her to listen to Chopin's work whenever they had visited one another. At her deathbed, Ólafur said “she was just lying there, old and sick, but very happy and proud. And I sat with her and we listened to a Chopin sonata. Then I kissed her goodbye and left. She passed away a few hours later.”
In 2015, Ólafur's collaborations with Nils Frahm, Life Story Love and Glory (a completely improvised recording) and Loon, were collected on a double CD entitled Collaborative Works along with 2012's Stare and a live improvisational film entitled Trance Frendz - An evening with Ólafur Arnalds and Nils Frahm.  2015 also saw the full release of his work on Broadchurch.

2016: Island Songs
In June 2016 Ólafur announced his Island Songs project, which would involve him working with director Baldvin Z and travelling to seven different locations in Iceland over seven weeks, collaborating with seven different artists. Each week the audio and video for each track would be released, culminating in the final track, ""Doria"", being released on 8 August 2016.
List of tracks with collaborators:

""Árbakkinn"" (ft. Einar Georg)
""1995"" (ft. Dagný Arnalds)
""Raddir"" (ft. South Iceland Chamber Choir)
""Öldurót"" (ft. Atli Örvarsson & SinfoniaNord)
""Dalur"" (ft. Brasstríó Mosfellsdals)
""Particles"" (ft. Nanna Bryndís from Of Monsters and Men)
""Doria""
""Particles"" ft. Nanna Bryndís from Of Monsters and Men was premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show on 1 August 2016, making it the first classical track featured on that station.
In 2016, Ólafur and Quarashi frontman Sölvi Blöndal founded the record label Alda Music, which was acquired by INgrooves in January 2022. Alda owned the rights to nearly 80 percent of all music released in Iceland.

2018: re:member
Ólafur's fourth official solo album, Re:member was released in August 2018. The album featured his new musical system called Stratus. The Stratus Pianos are two self-playing, semi-generative player pianos which are triggered by a central piano played by Arnalds. The custom-built software was born out of two years of work by the composer and audio developer, Halldor Eldjarn. As Arnalds plays a note on the piano, two different notes are generated by Stratus, creating unexpected harmonies and surprising melodic sequences.
The algorithms generated from Stratus were also used to create the album artwork. In an interview with Sound of Boston, Arnalds explains that the artist, Torsten Posselt from FELD studios, used the Stratus software as a starting point and made his own software that translated the same MIDI signals used for the music. Each dot corresponds to a piano note in the title track: 88 fields correspond to 88 notes; the thicker the dot, the higher the frequency of that note being played.
He composed the main theme for the Apple TV+ mini series Defending Jacob (miniseries).

2020: some kind of peace
His fifth studio album, Some Kind of Peace, was released on 6 November 2020. The album features guest appearances from Bonobo, Josin, and JFDR. ""Loom (feat. Bonobo)"" and ""The Bottom Line"" were nominated for Grammy Awards.

2023: OPIA Community
In October 2023, Ólafur officially launched the OPIA Community project, which is described as a ""travelling festival series, a record label and a community hub made up of creators, thinkers, art lovers and everything in-between."" The project had been in preparation since 2019, however was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 18 October 2023, Ólafur hosted the official OPIA Community launch event titled 'OPIA Night' at Silent Green in Berlin, Germany. The event featured several artists who Ólafur met online during the pandemic and have since been signed to the OPIA Community record label, including JFDR and Sofi Paez.

Help:Maintenance template removal,"Many Wikipedia pages display maintenance templates that identify problems. You may have arrived at this help page after clicking a link on a maintenance template saying ""Learn how and when to remove this template message"".
Maintenance templates are added and removed by volunteers. This help page explains the process for examining and removing such templates.

Maintenance templates (or ""tags"") are not removed automatically. Even if you fix the issue(s) described in a maintenance template, the tag will remain in the article until you or someone else manually removes it. The mechanics of removal are usually as simple as clicking ""Edit"" at the top of the page or in the section involved (if you're not already in edit mode), removing the code that produces the display of the template, leaving an edit summary, and saving the page.
It is not okay to remove maintenance templates until the issue flagged by the template is remedied first—that is, until the maintenance tag is no longer valid—unless it truly did not belong in the first place.
Wikipedia works because of the efforts of volunteers just like you, making bold edits to help build this encyclopedia. Fixing problems and then removing maintenance templates when you are done is important in that effort.

We don't know which maintenance tag brought you to this page, and thus what specific problem needs attention. However, every maintenance template contains links to help pages, policies, guidelines, or other relevant pages that provide information on the problem the template was placed to flag. You will also find guidance on some of the more common templates below.
Many common templates address problems with article citations and references, or their lack – because reliable sourcing is the lifeblood of Wikipedia articles and at the core of all of Wikipedia's content policies and guidelines, such as notability, verifiability, neutral point of view, and no original research. But a host of other issues may be flagged, including tone and style of writing, structure, and formatting, lack of links to or from other articles, compliance with Wikipedia's manual of style and the lack of a lead section.
Please make sure the issue has been resolved before removing the template. That does require some effort on your part—to understand both the problem and how to solve it.

An example
If the issue flagged by the maintenance template is that the article contains no references, a citation needed template used might be {{Unreferenced}} –  typically placed by the code you would see when wikitext (source) editing: {{Unreferenced|date=April 2024}}.
It is important to understand that what you see when reading an article, and what you see when editing it, are different unless you're in Visual editing mode. Thus, the above code, only seen when doing source editing, results in the display of the 'called' template below:

This template contains several links, indicated by the words and phrases in blue. Three of these links are to pages that, when explored, provide context and resources for you to understand why the template was placed on the page, and how to address the issue of the article being unreferenced:

""cite"", which links to the content guideline Wikipedia:Citing sources;
""sources"", which links to the policy Wikipedia:Verifiability; and
""adding citations to reliable sources"", which links to a help page providing a how-to guide to the basics of citing references.
Whatever maintenance tag brought you to this help page should likewise contain relevant explanatory links addressed to whatever its issue is. Read these explanatory and contextual pages to learn about the problem and what it is you need to do to take care of it. Again, some of the more common maintenance templates seen are addressed in the specific template guidance section below.

Maintenance templates are not meant to be in articles permanently. Any user without a conflict of interest may remove a maintenance template in any of the following circumstances:

When the issue has been adequately addressed;
Upon determining that the issue has been resolved (perhaps by someone else);
If it reasonably appears that the template did not belong when placed or was added in error. Consider first discussing the matter with the original placer of the template (unless this user is no longer active on Wikipedia). In any case, if the issue appears contentious, seek consensus on the talk page;
When an article talk  page discussion has not been initiated (for templates requesting it);
When there is consensus on the talk page (or elsewhere) as to how to address the flagged issue, and you are reasonably implementing those changes. (It is good practice to note the location of the consensus in the edit summary accompanying your removal, ideally with a link to the location);
When it can reasonably be concluded that the template is no longer relevant, such as a {{Current}} template appearing in an article that no longer documents a current event;
If the maintenance template is of a type that requires support but is not fully supported. For example, neutrality-related templates such as {{COI}} (associated with the conflict of interest guideline) or {{POV}} (associated with the neutral point of view policy) strongly recommend that the tagging editor initiate a discussion (generally on the article's talk page) to support the placement of the tag. If the tagging editor failed to do so, or the discussion is dormant, and there is no other support for the template, it can be removed;
You may remove a template when according to your best judgment the lack of edits and/or talk page discussion should be interpreted as the issue not worth fixing (as a form of ""silent consensus""). Please note there is currently no consensus for general age-related removal of maintenance templates – that is, removing a template purely or chiefly because it is old is not considered a sufficient argument. Exception: removing POV-related templates whose discussions have gone dormant is encouraged, as addressed in the bullet point immediately above;
Lastly, there are times when a person attempting to address a maintenance template that flags some fundamental matter may find that the issue cannot actually be addressed. For example, if an article is flagged as lacking citations to reliable, secondary sources, written by third-parties to the topic, and a user seeing the maintenance templates discovers that such sources appear not to exist, that usually means the article should be deleted. In such cases, it is not so much that the template does not belong and should be removed, but rather that flagging the page for maintenance will never address the more critical issue that the page itself does not belong on Wikipedia at all.

You should not remove maintenance templates if any of the following apply:

You do not understand the issues raised by the template;
The issue has not yet been resolved;
There is ongoing activity or discussion related to the template issue;
The problem that the maintenance template flags is plainly and unambiguously required for a proper article under Wikipedia's policies and guidelines;
You have been paid to edit the article or have some other conflict of interest [exceptions apply: see individual template documentation].

Have you carefully read the help pages and thoroughly fixed the problem? Or have you made a considered decision that the template is not, or is no longer, applicable? Great! Now, to remove the maintenance template:

Either click on ""edit"" or ""edit source"" at the top of the page, or if the maintenance template is not at the top but somewhere in the body of the article, you might instead use a section edit link;
If you are editing wikitext (""source"" editing): Delete the template code. The template code you see in this edit mode will usually be in the following form, as in the example above: {{Name of template|date=Month Year}}.  If you are editing using VisualEditor: Click on the template (tag), which will then turn blue. Press the ""Delete"" or backspace key on your keyboard.
Leave a descriptive edit summary, e.g., ""Removed [insert the name of template] because I have fixed the issue;""
Click Publish changes.
That's it. Thank you!

Problems flagged by some templates may imply secondary problems that will still exist after you take care of the main issue. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to switch the template to another applicable one following your edits, rather than just removing it. The reasoning behind the change in templates should be addressed in the edit summary.
A case in point is the {{Unreferenced}} template example used above. It is placed on pages with no references. Thus, adding just one suitable reference renders that maintenance template inapplicable. However, that change does not take care of the overarching issue of poor sourcing. In this example, a change to a different template may be appropriate, depending on the type, quality, depth, and manner of sourcing added to fix the issue, such as {{refimprove}}, {{No footnotes}}, {{Primary sources}}, or one of the many others listed at Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles.
Conversely, some templates flag highly discrete issues where there is no need to consider a switch to another template. For example, if an article is ""orphaned"" – no other articles in the main article namespace link to it – then once that is taken care of (by the addition of links to it from other articles), the issue is gone entirely and the tag's removal is unambiguous. 
When a flagged issue has been addressed in parts of an article but remains in discrete sections, clarity may be served by replacing the template with a section variant, or by use of inline cleanup tags, if such versions of the template exist.
In some cases, it may be helpful to request a review of a maintenance template's removal or proposed removal with the editor who initially added it to the article at issue.

This section guides you on how to address some of the more common specific templates that may have brought you to this help page. More detailed information about the templates can be found by following the links to the templates themselves.
Click ""show"" at the right to display the instructions.

Researching the tagged issue
As noted previously, most templates contain links to guidance pages. Additionally, many templates have documentation that provides more information about the template's flagged issue, which is displayed when you visit the template page itself.
To access the template and thereby see its documentation, type into the search field Template:, followed by the name of the template, seen when you view its placement in the Edit interface (typically found in the first lines of the article). The first ""parameter"" is the name of the template.
For example, if you found this in the Edit interface, {{Unreferenced|date=April 2024}}, then you would visit the template itself by searching for Template:Unreferenced. The accompanying documentation for all maintenance templates, if it exists, can be located in this way.

If you've read through this page and are still confused about what needs to be done to fix an issue on a page and remove a maintenance template, try asking at the Teahouse, a page designed for new users to ask questions. Alternatively, you could try the more general Help desk, or seek live assistance at the IRC channel: #wikipedia-en-help.

Help:Referencing for beginners,"One of the key policies of Wikipedia is that all article content has to be verifiable. This means that reliable sources must be able to support the material. All quotations, any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, and contentious material (whether negative, positive, or neutral) about living persons must include an inline citation to a source that directly supports the material. This also means that Wikipedia is not the place for original work, archival findings that have not been published, or evidence from any source that has not been published.
If you are adding new content, it is your responsibility to add sourcing information along with it. Material provided without a source is significantly more likely to be removed from an article. Sometimes it will be tagged first with a ""citation needed"" template to give editors a chance to find and add sources, but some editors will simply remove it because they question its veracity.
This tutorial will show you how to add inline citations to articles, and also briefly explain what Wikipedia considers to be a reliable source.

Inline citations are usually small, numbered footnotes like this. They are generally added either directly following the fact that they support, or at the end of the sentence that they support, following any punctuation. When clicked, they take the reader to a citation in a reference section near the bottom of the article.
While editing a page that uses the most common footnote style, you will see inline citations displayed between <ref>...</ref> tags.
If you are creating a new page, or adding references to a page that didn't previously have any, remember to add a References section like the one below near the end of the article:

==References==
{{reflist}}

Note: This is by far the most popular system for inline citations, but sometimes you will find other styles being used in an article. This is acceptable, and you shouldn't change it or mix styles. To add a new reference, just copy and modify an existing one.

Manually adding references can be a slow and tricky process. Fortunately, there is a tool called ""RefToolbar"" built into the Wikipedia edit window, which makes it much easier.
To use it, click on  Cite at the top of the edit window, having already positioned your cursor after the sentence or fact you wish to reference. Then select one of the 'Templates' from the dropdown menu that best suits the type of source. These are:

{{cite web}} for references to general websites
{{cite news}} for newspapers and news websites
{{cite book}} for references to books
{{cite journal}} for magazines, academic journals, and papers
A template window then pops up, where you fill in as much information as possible about the source, and give a unique name for it in the ""Ref name"" field. Click the ""Insert"" button, which will add the required wikitext in the edit window. If you wish, you can also ""Preview"" how your reference will look first.
Some fields (such as a web address, also known as a URL) will have a  icon next to them. After filling in this field, you can click it to handily autofill the remaining fields. It doesn't always work properly, though, so be sure to double check it.
Often, you will want to use the same source more than once in an article to support multiple facts. In this case, you can click Named references   in the toolbar, and select a previously added source to re-use.

As an alternative to the RefToolbar, it is possible to insert citations in the source editor using a similar automated tool as the one used in the visual editor. For this, you need to enable the ""2017 wikitext editor"" in your preferences. You will then be able to edit the source of pages while inserting citations using the automated tool of the visual editor.

Wikipedia articles require reliable, published sources that directly support the information presented in the article. Now you know how to add sources to an article, but which sources should you use?
The word ""source"" in Wikipedia has three meanings: the work itself (for example, a document, article, paper, or book), the creator of the work (for example, the writer), and the publisher of the work (for example, Cambridge University Press). All three can affect reliability.

Reliable sources are those with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. They tend to have an editorial process with multiple people scrutinizing work before it is published. Academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources. Other reliable sources include university textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals, and news coverage (not opinions) from mainstream newspapers.
Self-published media, where the author and publisher are the same, are usually not acceptable as sources. These can include newsletters, personal websites, press releases, patents, open wikis, personal or group blogs, and tweets. However, if an author is an established expert with a previous record of third-party publications on a topic, their self-published work may be considered reliable for that particular topic.
Whether a source is usable also depends on context. Sources that are reliable for some material are not reliable for other material. For instance, otherwise unreliable self-published sources are usually acceptable to support uncontroversial information about the source's author. You should always try to use the best possible source, particularly when writing about living people.
These are general guidelines, but the topic of reliable sources is a complicated one, and is impossible to fully cover here. You can find more information at Wikipedia:Verifiability and at Wikipedia:Reliable sources. There is also a list of commonly used sources with information on their reliability.
